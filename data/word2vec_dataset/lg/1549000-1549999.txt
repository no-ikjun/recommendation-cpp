 The inspiration for " Rain " is agreed on by Neil Aspinall , the Beatles ' roadie , and John Lennon . They both described the band 's arrival in Melbourne , Australia , marked by rain and poor weather . Lennon said , " I 've never seen rain as hard as that , except in Tahiti " , and later explained that " Rain " was " about people moaning about the weather all the time " . Another interpretation is that the song 's " rain " and " sun " are phenomena experienced during a benign LSD trip . 
 While technologically elaborate , " Rain " has a simple musical structure . Set in the key of G major ( the final mix pitches it about a quarter of a semitone below this , while the backing track was taped in G sharp ) , it begins with what Alan W. Pollack calls , " a ra @-@ ta @-@ tat half @-@ measure 's fanfare of solo snare drums " , followed by a guitar intro of the first chord . The verses are nine measures long , and the song is in 4 / 4 time . Each verse is based on the G , C , and D chords ( I , IV , and V ) . The refrain contains only I and IV chords , and is twelve measures long ( the repetition of a six @-@ measure pattern ) . The first two measures are the G chord . The third and fourth measures are the C chord . The third measure has the C chord in the so @-@ called 6 / 4 ( second ) inversion . The fifth and sixth measures return to the G chord . Pollack says the refrain seems slower than the verse , though it is at the same tempo , an illusion achieved by " the change of beat for the first four measures from its erstwhile bounce to something more plodding and regular " . After four verses and two refrains , a short solo for guitar and drums is played , with complete silence for one beat . What is heard next is what Pollack calls " historically significant " reverse lyrics . The Beatles pioneered the fade @-@ out fade @-@ in coda that was later used on " Strawberry Fields Forever " which can also be heard on Led Zeppelin 's " Thank You " . 
 = = Recording = = 
 Recording began on 14 April 1966 , in the same session as " Paperback Writer " , and concluded on 16 April , with a series of overdubs before mixing on the same day . At that time , The Beatles were enthusiastic about experimenting in the studio to achieve new sounds and effects . These experiments were showcased in their seventh album , Revolver . Geoff Emerick , who was the engineer for both sessions , described one technique he used to alter the sonic texture of the track by recording the backing track " faster than normal . " When played back , slightly slower than the usual speed , " the music had a radically different tonal quality . The opposite technique was used to alter the tone of Lennon 's lead vocal : it was recorded with the tape machine slowed down , making Lennon 's voice sound higher when played back . 
 The last verse of " Rain " includes backwards vocals , one of the first uses of this technique on a record . The backwards vocals are Lennon singing the lyrics of the song : " When the sun shines , " " Rain , " and " If the rain comes , they run and hide their heads . " Both Lennon and producer George Martin have claimed credit for the idea ; Lennon said : 
 Emerick confirms Lennon 's creative accident , but Martin remembers it differently : 
 Later , in 1980 , John claimed : 
 Regardless of who is credited for the technique , " from that point on , " Emerick wrote , " almost every overdub we did on Revolver had to be tried backwards as well as forwards . " 
 The " Paperback Writer " / " Rain " single was the first release to use a new device invented by the maintenance department at Abbey Road called " <unk> " for " Automatic Transient Overload Control " . The new device allowed the record to be cut at a louder volume , louder than any other single up to that time . On the final mix of the single , Lennon played a 1965 Gretsch Nashville , Paul McCartney a 1964 Rickenbacker 4001S bass , Harrison a 1964 Gibson SG , and Ringo Starr used Ludwig drums . Both McCartney and Starr have been praised for their performances on their instruments in this song . Starr particularly liked his drumming effort .

 The Beatles created three promotional films for " Rain " which are considered among the early precursors of music videos . The films were directed by Michael Lindsay @-@ Hogg who worked with them earlier on the pop 1960 television programme Ready Steady Go ! One features the Beatles walking and singing in a garden and a greenhouse ( filmed 20 May 1966 at Chiswick House in London ) . The other two feature the band performing on a sound stage ( filmed 19 May 1966 , one in colour for Ed Sullivan and the other in black and white for the UK ) . McCartney was injured in a moped accident on 26 December 1965 , six months prior to the filming of " Rain " and closeups in the film reveal a scarred lip and a chipped tooth . McCartney 's appearance in the film played a role in the " Paul is dead " rumours from 1969 . 
 The Beatles ' Anthology documentary video includes a re @-@ edit of two of these three clips , full of rhythmic fast cuts and several shots that went unused in the original videos . This creates an impression that the videos were more technically complex , fast @-@ paced , and innovative than was the case . For example , the backwards film effects shown here are 1990s creations . Such effects were actually first deployed in the " Strawberry Fields Forever " promotional film of January 1967 .

 The song 's highest chart position in the US was number 23 ( 11 June 1966 ) . The " Paperback Writer " single reached number one in the UK ( for two weeks starting on 23 June 1966 ) . " Rain " is one of the Beatles ' most critically acclaimed songs , appearing on best @-@ of lists , including Rolling Stone magazine 's The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time ( # 463 ) . AcclaimedMusic.net , ranks " Rain " at # 1066 on the Top 3000 Songs , the 31st highest @-@ rated Beatle song on the site . The song was ranked as the 382nd best song of all time by <unk> 
 Notable in " Rain " is Ringo Starr 's drumming , which Starr rates as his best recorded performance . Critics agreed : both Ian MacDonald and Rolling Stone said his drumming was " superb " and Richie Unterberger of AllMusic praised his " creative drum breaks " . In 1984 , Starr assessed his performance stating , " I think it 's the best out of all the records I 've ever made . ' Rain ' blows me away ... I know me and I know my playing ... and then there 's ' Rain ' " .

 " Rain " cover versions include Petula Clark , Ibex , Bongwater , Humble Pie , The Jam , The Clash , Shonen Knife , The <unk> , Galaxie 500 , Hard Meat , <unk> , Gregg Allman , Antietam and Wang Chung . The Grateful Dead performed the song throughout the 1990s , often as an encore . U2 has played the song in whole or in part throughout many of their tours , usually during outdoor concerts when it has started to rain . Pearl Jam improvised the song into their song " Jeremy " during their 1992 Pinkpop Festival show and played it in full at the Isle of Wight Festival in 2012 . Kula Shaker covered the song live at Reading Festival in 1996 as did Fairport Convention , featuring Dan Ar Braz , at the <unk> Festival in 1997 . Todd Rundgren has also covered the song , as has the late Dan <unk> , who reprised it as part of his own cover of " Rhythm of the Rain " . 
 The Beatles tribute act Rain derives its name from the song . 
 = 1909 Greater Antilles hurricane = 
 The 1909 Greater Antilles hurricane was a rare , late @-@ season tropical cyclone that caused extensive damage and loss of life in Jamaica and Haiti . Forming out of a large disturbance in early November , the hurricane began as a minimal tropical storm over the southwestern Caribbean Sea on November 8 . Slowly tracking northwestward , the system gradually intensified . Late on November 11 , the storm brushed the eastern tip of Jamaica before attaining hurricane status . The following afternoon , the storm made landfall in northwest Haiti with winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) . After moving over the Atlantic Ocean , the hurricane further intensified and attained its peak winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) on November 13 . The system rapidly transitioned into an extratropical cyclone the following day before being absorbed by a frontal system northeast of the Lesser Antilles . 
 Including rainfall from the precursor to the hurricane , rainfall in Jamaica peaked at 114 @.@ 50 in ( 2 @,@ 908 mm ) Silver Hill Plantation . These extreme rains led to widespread flooding that killed 30 people and left $ 7 million in damage throughout the country . The worst damage in Haiti was caused rains exceeding 24 in ( 610 mm ) that led to catastrophic flooding . At least 166 people are known to have been killed in the country ; however , reports indicate that hundreds likely died during the storm . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of the 1909 Greater Antilles hurricane are unclear , but are believed to have begun with a large , slow @-@ moving storm system near Jamaica in early November . By November 8 , it was classified as a tropical storm and was situated over the southwestern Caribbean Sea , north of Panama . A ship in the vicinity of the system recorded an atmospheric pressure of 1004 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 68 inHg ) . Slowly moving northeastward , an unusual direction for a Caribbean cyclone , the storm gradually intensified . The forward motion of the system steadily increased on November 10 as it headed towards Jamaica . Late on November 11 , the system brushed the eastern tip of Jamaica as a strong tropical storm , with maximum winds estimated at 70 mph ( 120 km / h ) . Several hours later , the storm intensified into what would now be classified a Category 1 hurricane on the Saffir – Simpson Hurricane Scale . During the afternoon of November 12 , the hurricane made landfall in northern Haiti , in the Nord @-@ Ouest Department , with winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) . After briefly moving over land , the storm entered the Atlantic Ocean and turned east @-@ northeast and further accelerated . 
 Early on November 13 , the hurricane further intensified to the equivalent of a Category 2 system and attained peak winds of 105 mph ( 165 km / h ) . No barometric pressure was recorded at the time of peak intensity since it occurred over water and away from any ships . In an initial analysis of the storm made by meteorologist José Fernández Partagás in 1999 , he wrote that at the storm 's peak , it was a strong tropical storm , not a hurricane . In a report , it was stated that " It was a difficult case for the author [ Partagás ] to decide whether or not to upgrade to a hurricane " . It was not until the Atlantic hurricane database re @-@ analysis reached 1909 in February 2004 that the storm was designated as a hurricane . By November 14 , the storm began to weaken as it turned nearly due east . Later that day , it quickly transitioned into an extratropical cyclone before being absorbed by a frontal system northeast of the Lesser Antilles . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Prior to becoming a tropical storm , the precursor low had been producing heavy rainfall across Jamaica since November 5 . Further rains fell as the system intensified and neared the country . Between November 5 and 11 , the system produced 30 @.@ 45 in ( 773 mm ) of rain in Kingston . More extreme rains fell upon the Silver Hill Plantation , where 114 @.@ 50 inches ( 2 @,@ 908 mm ) of rain accumulated in the five @-@ day period of November 5 – 9 , with eight @-@ day totals from November 4 – 11 reaching 135 @.@ 00 inches ( 3 @,@ 429 mm ) . This rainfall triggered severe flooding . Roughly 500 @,@ 000 banana plants were lost as a result of the floods , about 20 % of the entire country 's yield . Around Kingston , the waterworks was destroyed and several tunnels and railways were blocked by landslides . Many bridges and roads were also damaged or destroyed . This led to many towns being isolated and hampered rescue efforts . Flood waters in the town of <unk> Bay reached 3 ft ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) . Throughout Jamaica , the flooding killed 30 people and damage was estimated at $ 7 million ( 1909 USD ) . Following the severe flooding , the Jamaican government allocated about $ 150 @,@ 000 in funds for damage repair . 
 In nearby Haiti , the damage from the hurricane was catastrophic as torrential rains , reported to have exceeded 24 in ( 610 mm ) , triggered widespread flooding and landslides throughout the country . Initial reports from Haiti were slow to reach the news media as most roads were flooded or destroyed . Several days after the hurricane 's passage , reports began to indicate that immense damage had taken place due to the storm . The city of Gonaïves was completely flooded after a nearby river overflowed its banks . Residents sought safety from the flood waters in the upper floors and roofs of their homes . Sixteen people were killed in the city after a bridge was destroyed by the swollen river . The <unk> River near Port @-@ au @-@ Prince also topped its banks , inundating nearby areas . 
 Along the Yaqui River , unprecedented flooding led to the creation of a large lake , estimated to be 30 mi ( 48 km ) long and up to 80 ft ( 24 m ) deep . Many villages were destroyed by the floods , with hundreds of fatalities expected to result from the storm . Monetary losses for Haiti following the disaster are scarce , with the only known damage estimate being $ 3 million . However , the true damage cost from the hurricane is likely much higher . At least 166 fatalities are known as a result of the storm in Haiti ; however , many reports state that several hundred people likely perished during the storm . Most of the fatalities took place in the Nord @-@ Ouest Department where 150 victims were identified . 
 = Holy Rosary Cathedral ( Vancouver ) = 
 The Metropolitan Cathedral of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary , commonly known as Holy Rosary Cathedral , is a late 19th @-@ century French Gothic revival church that serves as the cathedral of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Vancouver . It is located in the downtown area of the city at the intersection of Richards and Dunsmuir streets . 
 The construction of the cathedral began in 1899 on the site of an earlier church by the same name . It opened on the Feast of the Immaculate Conception on December 8 , 1900 , was blessed the day after , and was consecrated in 1953 . The style has been described as resembling the medieval Chartres Cathedral in France . The church was elevated to the status of cathedral in 1916 . It is listed on the Vancouver Heritage Register and is a legally protected building . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Original structure ( 1887 – 1899 ) = = = 
 The parish was established in June 1885 and Father Patrick Fay , the chaplain to Canadian Pacific Railway ( CPR ) workers , was chosen as pastor . He officiated the first mass of the parish on the feast of Our Lady of the Rosary in the same year at an unknown location . Although masses were held in Blair ’ s Hall and Keefer ’ s Hall , it became apparent that a new and permanent church was necessary to cope with the growing number of parishioners , which consisted of 69 families . 
 In order to pick a site for the new church , legend has it that Father Fay went to the Coal Harbour waterfront , looked south towards the forested land ( present @-@ day Downtown Vancouver ) and chose the area that contained the tallest tree . Construction began in 1886 and the wooden church was completed and blessed in the following year . Two years later , the church was enlarged and a bell tower was added . 
 = = = Present @-@ day cathedral = = = 
 With the rapid growth of Vancouver at the time , plans were made for a greater expansion of the church . Because Fay was transferred in 1892 and died shortly after , Father <unk> succeeded him in overseeing the plan for construction from 1893 to 1897 . Then , the new pastor of the church , Father James McGuckin , took over the project . By that time , the number of parishioners had outgrown the size of the church building . In order to fund the construction of the new church , the Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate ( OMI ) – the religious order McGuckin belonged to – mortgaged their headquarters in France , and before his death , Fay worked as a CPR foreman for a construction crew . Initially , parishioners and the OMI were skeptical of the project ; the parish was already heavily in debt when McGuckin became pastor , the Catholic community in Vancouver – though " rapidly growing " – was still " relatively small " in number , and a friend of McGuckin who was a contractor was unable to provide the funds he had initially pledged . These problems culminated in the construction project being labelled " McGuckin 's Folly " . 
 Despite these doubts , the cornerstone of the new church was laid on July 16 , 1899 , by Archbishop <unk> Langevin of Saint Boniface . Thomas <unk> Julian and H.J. Williams were hired to be the architects , and in just 491 days , the construction was completed . At the time it was finished , the building was praised as " the finest piece of architecture west of Toronto and north of San Francisco . " The new Church of Our Lady of the Holy Rosary opened on December 8 , 1900 – the Feast of the Immaculate Conception – and was blessed one day later by Archbishop Alexander Christie of Portland , Oregon . By the end of the decade , it became " the most financially important parish " in the archdiocese , since it was the only church that not only could break @-@ even , but could also churn out a surplus . Because of this , Archbishop Timothy Casey wanted to make the church the cathedral for the metropolitan see . The OMI were extremely reluctant to give up their church , and even attempted to give Casey money so that he could buy land elsewhere to build a new cathedral . Nonetheless , the church was elevated to the status of cathedral in 1916 , but the Oblates were permitted to remain . The OMI – which administered the parish since 1893 – eventually left in 1927 after difficulties arose from the mortgage agreement that had helped pay for the construction of the cathedral . This was coupled with the " growing manpower shortage " caused by a declining number of members joining the order . 
 Since a Catholic church can only be consecrated once it has become free from debt , the cathedral did not have its rite of consecration held until October 3 , 1953 , fifty @-@ three years after it first opened . The ceremony – which commenced just after daybreak – was officiated by the Archbishop of Vancouver William M. Duke , with the subsequent solemn pontifical Mass celebrated by Michael Harrington , the Bishop of Kamloops . Approximately thirty @-@ five bishops from across Canada and the United States attended the event , which coincided with Duke 's golden and silver jubilees of his priestly ordination and consecration as a bishop , respectively . 
 On October 7 , 1952 , the feast day of the cathedral 's namesake , a gunman entered the church and fired a round from his rifle at the altar . No one was hurt and he was arrested shortly after . A minor tilt in the bell tower of the cathedral was detected in April 1959 , probably due to the drilling and blasting of a nearby tunnel . 
 Many significant events have taken place at the cathedral . In 1936 , it hosted an archdiocesan @-@ level Eucharistic Congress , the first congress ever to be celebrated in Western Canada . Forty @-@ eight years later , in 1984 , Pope John Paul II visited the church as part of his pastoral visit to Canada . In late September 2001 , the cathedral became the first place in Canada to host the relics of Saint Thérèse of Lisieux during her reliquary 's three @-@ month @-@ long tour of the country . 
 Over the years , several notable people had their funeral requiem mass said at the cathedral , including beloved local lifeguard and swim instructor Joe Fortes ( 1922 ) , Chief Dan George of the <unk> @-@ <unk> Nation ( 1981 ) , and former Vancouver police commissioner William Cameron Murphy in 1961 . The funeral of Fortes in February 1922 saw the cathedral filled to capacity , with thousands of others braving the rain and cold weather to view the funeral procession on the streets of Vancouver . Requiem masses were also held at the cathedral for popes Pius XI ( 1939 ) and Saint John Paul II ( 2005 ) , while an interfaith requiem was also held for former Governor General of Canada Georges Vanier in 1967 .

 = = = Steeples and interior = = = 
 The cathedral , built in a French Gothic style , is cruciform in the shape of the Latin cross . The exterior walls of the church were built from sandstone originating from <unk> Island , while its foundations were made of granite . The two bell towers – which are asymmetric – have been labelled as the cathedral 's " most prominent visual feature " . The taller steeple was originally designed to have flying buttresses at the bottom . The interior features columns that support the nave which are made from red <unk> marble . The cathedra is situated at the centre of the sanctuary , surrounded by an oak altar @-@ piece and two towers of reredos . In total , the dimensions of the church building are 161 ft ( 49 m ) long , 104 ft ( 32 m ) wide and 62 ft ( 19 m ) tall , with the taller steeple rising to 217 ft ( 66 m ) . 
 Over the years , the cathedral has undergone a series of renovations . In late 1932 , the " tin scales " that covered spire of the taller steeple were cleaned and repaired , and the cross atop of it was repainted . The reordering of the sanctuary took place in the 1960s after the Second Vatican Council . <unk> also took place prior to Pope John Paul II 's visit to the cathedral in 1984 . The cathedral was completely re @-@ roofed from 1995 to 1997 , with zinc being utilized on the roof to resemble slate . In December 2002 , some of the carpeting was removed and replaced with Italian ceramic tiles , and the inside of the church was repainted from 2004 to 2006 . 
 = = = Bells = = = 
 When the cathedral was first built , seven bells – representing the sacraments – were cast at the Fonderie Paccard in Annecy @-@ le @-@ Vieux , Savoy , France and were blessed on October 21 , 1900 . However , they were soon found to be out of tune and were sent back to Europe , this time to a foundry near Bristol . This time , eight bells were made in order to complete an entire octave when rung . They were reinstalled in the cathedral in 1906 and operate on change ringing . They are one of the few peal of bells hung in the English style found in North America , and one of three in British Columbia – the others are located at Westminster Abbey in Mission and Victoria 's Christ Church Cathedral . The bells were notably rung on Dominion Day in 1911 – the first peal ever to be rung in Canada – and on February 12 , 2010 , in honour of the opening of the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver . 
 = = = Organ = = = 
 The cathedral 's pipe organ was originally built and inaugurated in the autumn of 1900 . Manufactured by the Karn – Warren Organ Company in Woodstock , Ontario , the organ is the " oldest romantic @-@ style organ " in the province " remaining in its original location " . Over the years , the instrument 's condition deteriorated due to " general wear and tear " , shoddy repairs and water damage caused by the leaking roof . As a result , the organ was dismantled in 1999 and transported to <unk> Frères in Saint @-@ Hyacinthe , Quebec . It was restored within two years and returned to the church , where it was blessed in Easter of 2000 . In that same year , an organ concert series was hosted at the cathedral for the first time , and has been held annually since .

 There are currently 21 stained glass windows at the cathedral . The most renowned ones are the five windows made by Canadian artist Guido <unk> . They depict Our Lady of the Holy Rosary , the Baptism of Our Lord , Jesus Healing the Sick , Jesus with the Children and the Assumption . The window showing Our Lady of the Holy Rosary featured on Canada Post 's annual Christmas stamp in 1997 . Furthermore , the Institute for Stained Glass in Canada documented the stained glass windows at the cathedral .

 The cathedral made news in 2007 , with the Vancouver Police Department having to be called in on a weekly basis ; cathedral staff claimed they were " under siege " by <unk> who frequented the building and who were involved in at least one incident daily . These revelations came to light when a homeless man mugged an 81 @-@ year @-@ old parishioner in the cathedral on August 1 of that year and was caught on camera . 
 On March 23 , 2008 , First Nations protesters disrupted an Easter Sunday Mass at the cathedral by demonstrating on the outside steps . They ordered the Church to " get off native land " and demanded that they disclose the burial locations of children who died in residential schools . A similar protest occurred on October 30 , 2011 , when a splinter group from the Occupy Vancouver movement marched to the cathedral from the Vancouver Art Gallery . They attempted to enter the cathedral and occupy it but were thwarted by Vancouver police officers and Knights of Columbus . 
 = TISM = 
 TISM ( an acronym of This Is Serious Mum ) were a seven @-@ piece anonymous alternative rock band from Melbourne , Australia . The group were formed on 30 December 1982 by vocalist / drummer Humphrey B. Flaubert , bassist / vocalist Jock Cheese and keyboardist / vocalist Eugene de la Hot Croix Bun , and enjoyed a large underground / independent following . Their third album , Machiavelli and the Four Seasons , reached the Australian national top 10 in 1995 . 
 TISM were known for their hybrid of dance music and rock 'n'roll , high @-@ energy live shows and humorous lyrics . TISM 's songs frequently satirised modern culture , celebrities and the entertainment industry , classic literature and art , current affairs , politics and sport . The titles of their songs were often wordplays created by juxtaposing pop culture references with more intellectual ones ( for example , " Martin Scorsese Is Really Quite a <unk> Fellow " , " Jung Talent Time " and the album Machiavelli and the Four Seasons ) .

 On 30 December 1982 , Damian Cowell ( " Humphrey B. Flaubert " - drums and lead vocals ) , John Holt ( " Jock Cheese " - guitar , bass and backing vocals ) and Eugene Cester ( " Eugene de la Hot Croix Bun " - keyboards and backing vocals ) , recorded a nine @-@ song session called Great Truckin ' Songs of the Renaissance under the name This Is Serious Mum at the home of friend Peter Minack ( " Ron Hitler @-@ Barassi " ) . Minack , Cowell and Cester were members of a group called " I Can Run " , which slowly evolved into This Is Serious Mum . 
 The band 's first concert was on 6 December 1983 . The Get Fucked Concert at the Duncan McKinnon Athletics Reserve in the small suburb of <unk> was considered a complete failure which caused the band to split up . They reformed in February 1984 and returned to their recordings , experimenting with dark ambient and industrial music , before returning to their rock style . They consider every subsequent performance a " re @-@ union gig " . 
 By 1985 the band were playing regularly around Melbourne and soon released a 10 @-@ track demo composed of selections from their recordings followed by their début single , " <unk> on My Face " ( 1986 ) , a 7 " vinyl record packaged in a 12 " sleeve with all four sides glued shut . This song is also found ( but is unlisted ) on the EP Form and Meaning Reach Ultimate Communion as a country version . Their next single , " 40 Years - Then Death " ( 1987 ) , was released on transparent vinyl in a clear plastic sleeve with no cover art or labels . This Is Serious Mum 's first radio @-@ friendly single , despite the obscure packaging , was received well . 
 The début album , Great Truckin ' Songs of the Renaissance ( 1988 ) , is a double vinyl release in an embossed gatefold sleeve . The first record contained twelve of TISM 's most popular tracks , and the second was a pastiche of interviews , bedroom recordings and live diatribes . Despite this odd combination , Truckin ' Songs entered the lower reaches of Australia 's mainstream Top 50 , as did the single " Saturday Night Palsy " . Later that year , The TISM Guide To Little Aesthetics , a book compiling lyrics , interviews and press releases , was published . Even though the physical books were printed in 1989 , they could not be released until 1990 due to TISM being required to hand @-@ censor the book with a mixture of white @-@ out and permanent marker , as well as place " CENSORED <unk> TO LEGAL <unk> " stickers on each copy of the book . Some uncensored copies of the book do exist , however . 
 In 1990 , TISM entered negotiations with CBS Records and Phonogram Records and were signed by the latter . In April that year , the band began work on what would become their next album with producer Laurence Maddy . When Phonogram released Hot Dogma ( 1990 ) it failed to reach the commercial charts , and TISM were fired six months later due to management issues , despite owing the label tens of thousands of dollars . Hot Dogma is the first release to use the <unk> form of the band 's name exclusively . 
 Over two nights in May 1991 , the band were filmed live and released the video <unk> in Ten Continents ( 1991 ) . These performances were the last for guitarist Leek Van Vlalen . 
 = = = Rise to fame = = = 
 In mid @-@ 1991 , independent record label Shock Records signed TISM and re @-@ issued Great Truckin ' Songs of the Renaissance , as well as the EP Gentlemen , Start Your <unk> ( 1991 ) , a compilation of tracks previously unavailable on CD . TISM , with producer Tony Cohen , then released the EP Beasts of Suburban ( 1992 ) . A new guitarist , ' Tony Coitus ' ( later ' Tokin ' Blackman ' ) joined the group onstage for the first time on 23 January 1992 . 
 The next EP , Australia The Lucky Cunt ( 1993 ) was TISM 's most controversial release to date . Courts issued an injunction order of the CD when the Ken Done Society threatened legal action over the artwork , which parodied Done 's signature style and depicted a koala sucking a syringe . The matter was settled for an undisclosed amount of money " fairly close to the amount that Radiohead spends on buying friends " and was re @-@ released with new artwork as Censored Due To Legal Advice . During 1994 , TISM sometimes played under the names " The Frank <unk> Jazz Quartet " , " Machiavelli and the Four Seasons " ( which would later be used as an album title ) and " Late for Breakfast " . 
 TISM 's biggest success was the 1995 album Machiavelli and the Four Seasons . The release was a shift from alternative @-@ rock to synth @-@ driven techno and dance which retained vocal melodies and loud guitars . The album was certified gold and won an ARIA Award for Best Independent Release . Three of its singles reached Triple J 's Hottest 100 , two of them in the top 10 . On 27 April 1995 the band appeared on the <unk> show Under Melbourne Tonight and performed " Protest Song " and " ( He 'll Never Be An ) Ol ' Man River " . 
 Success exposed TISM to mainstream Australian radio and television , most of which was perplexed by the band 's guerrilla approach to interviews and lack of interest in the music industry . A four CD box set of early albums was released and steady record sales allowed extensive tours of Australia and New Zealand . In 1996 TISM toured on the Big Day Out , during which Ron Hitler @-@ Barassi was either absent or wheelchair @-@ bound due to a detached retina and broken arm caused by a stage dive he performed at the Pacific Hotel , Lorne , Victoria prior to the tour . Later the same year , TISM toured England , the group 's sole Northern Hemisphere excursion . 
 Taking a year off from touring , TISM spent 1997 working on their next album with producer Lachlan Magoo . The album , <unk> ( 1998 ) was announced via a series of live Internet chats and webcasts . The first official music video for the album , I Might Be A Cunt , But I 'm Not A Fucking Cunt was rarely broadcast . Returned and Services League of Australia head Bruce Ruxton wrote a letter of complaint to Shock Records describing it as " ... Dropping [ Australia 's standards ] through the floor into the proverbial sewer . " The letter was published on TISM 's website at the time . 
 <unk> sold reasonably well , thanks in part to an extensive Australian tour with Regurgitator , then at the height of their popularity , and The <unk> ; however , sales were low compared to Machiavelli and the Four Seasons 's success and TISM 's contract with Shock ended by mutual agreement . 
 = = = After Shock records = = = 
 Following the 1998 tour , TISM signed with Festival Mushroom Records , which re @-@ released their entire back catalogue ( except for Hot Dogma , their previous singles and the bonus discs for Machiavelli and <unk> ) on CD . Their first and only official album with FMR , De <unk> ( 2001 ) , débuted at No. 24 on the ARIA chart and No. 3 on the Alternative ARIA Chart . Flaubert predicted on Triple J radio that the album would " plummet out of the top 40 like a stone " ; – the following week , it was not on the list . Touring became less thorough than in previous years , though no less active – at the closing of the <unk> Club , the band ended up naked and tore the ceiling down during the gig . In early 2002 , the track " Honk If You Love Fred Durst " was released as a single . FMR then released <unk> ( 2002 ) , a best of compilation which included their greatest hits , two new tracks and a disc of remastered Bedroom Recordings . The compilation was their third , and last , release with Festival Mushroom Records , as TISM 's contract had ended . 
 Finding themselves with no record label again , TISM returned to touring . In late 2003 , a special one @-@ off concert was filmed and released on DVD as The White <unk> ( 2004 ) by Madman Entertainment . A documentary and full length album were also included , making it a 3 @-@ disc set which received good reviews ; however , the release was not eligible for ARIA chart tracking . The concert DVD is presented as a telethon at which TISM breaks up . Ironically , TISM performed after that concert in order to promote the set . 
 For six years , TISM 's final release seemed to be the German CD @-@ single " Everyone Else Has Had More Sex Than Me " ( 2005 ) . It was TISM 's first non @-@ Australian release : Sony / BMG Germany expressed interest when the song 's animated clip was an Internet hit thanks to bloggers and sites such as YouTube . The single reached the German commercial charts . 
 At the band 's penultimate concert on 13 November 2004 , Ron Hitler @-@ Barassi delivered a diatribe saying that the band had " lost the election " and made references to Guy Sebastian winning the year 's season of Australian Idol . This opening remark can be interpreted as the band announcing their breakup . 
 = = = Current status = = = 
 In a 2006 interview with Triple J , when asked about the current status of TISM , Flaubert remarked : " we are slowly moving towards our deaths " . In early December that year , Flaubert contributed to the ABC 's " My Favourite Album " program , where he stated his favourite album as " Any album – as long as it 's by Nickelback ! " Later the same month , TISM were inducted into the EG ( The Age Entertainment Guide ) Hall of Fame , at which they made an appearance and " a hilariously irreverent speech " . 
 TISM 's final concert was at the <unk> Festival on 27 October 2004 . For all appearances , it had appeared that TISM had split , with no announcement or fanfare . 
 In early 2007 , a Melbourne country and western band called Root ! appeared on MySpace , with Humphrey B. Flaubert ( now called DC Root ) on vocals . Their debut album was released in December 2007 . 
 On 29 April 2008 , guitarist James Paull ( Tokin ' Blackman ) died of cancer . Initial news reports confused Paull with bassist Jock Cheese ( the confusion stemming from Paull 's personal nickname of Jock ) . He was survived by his wife Maddy and their daughter Ella . 
 In October 2009 , the majority of TISM 's back catalogue was re @-@ released on iTunes with bonus material . 
 In 2010 , their website ( <unk> ) was altered to show an older @-@ style TISM logo with TISM related mannerisms that altered when the page was refreshed . On 8 April 2011 , YouTube user " <unk> " uploaded a previously unseen video of Tokin ' Blackman improvising a guitar solo . It was added to the front page of <unk> on 29 April 2011 , the third anniversary of Tokin 's passing , prior to the site being revamped and relaunched . 
 In March 2010 , TISM released on iTunes , a " 21st century mix " of their single Shut Up – The Footy 's On The Radio The 21st century mix had Humphrey B. Flaubert on vocals and Jock Cheese on guitars , and had wholly new lyrics . This is the most recent TISM release to date . 
 In mid @-@ 2010 , Flaubert 's project Root ! announced they would be playing their " Last Ever Show " on 20 August 2010 . Although the press release concluded with " ... is there a new project on the way ? All will be revealed soon . Stay tuned . " Following this , a Facebook page was sent out to friends of DC Root which promoted a new band named ' The <unk> ' ; itself a reference to ' DC Root ' and his real name of Damian Cowell . The band 's first single was released on 26 November 2010 titled " I Was The Guy in TISM . " 
 In early 2011 , a video of a TISM @-@ like band performing was uploaded , said to be of ex @-@ TISM members Les Miserables , Jock Cheese , Leek Van Vlalen and Eugene de la Hot Croix Bun performing for Van Vlalen 's 50th birthday party . The songs performed were " <unk> ' , " I 'm Interested in Apathy " and the country version of " <unk> on My Face " . 
 In October 2012 guitarist Sean Kelly ( ' Leak Van Vlalen ' ) teamed with " old friend and die hard TISM fan " Kieran Butler for two Melbourne shows as <unk> , performing TISM songs interspersed with Kelly chatting about " what went on behind the scenes – and the balaclavas . " During 2012 and 2013 , the duo performed several shows . 
 In April 2013 , Kieran Butler talked with Damian Cowell , occasionally touching on his time in TISM . 
 In 2015 , Cowell crowd @-@ funded and launched his solo project and self @-@ titled album Damian Cowell 's Disco Machine , the album including notable entertainment personalities such as Kathy Lette , Tony Martin and Shaun Micallef , Lee Lin Chin , The Bedroom Philosopher , Kate Miller @-@ Heidke , Tim Rogers and John Safran - most of whom performed at the sold out show at The Corner Hotel in late February 2015 . This show followed the announcement that Australia would be invited to enter the Eurovision Song Contest and a petition was started on Change.org to reunite TISM as Australia 's representatives . The petition received national news coverage in Australia after amassing several thousand signatories on its first day .

Flaubert programs rhythms and samples , and has occasionally played acoustic <unk> live . There has been more than one person performing under the Les Miserables name , as confirmed by Sean Kelly ( Leak Van Vlalen ) during the " <unk> " video . 
 = = = Identities = = = 
 TISM have used a variety of methods to conceal their identities . They have never officially revealed their names , instead choosing to use pseudonyms on their records and in interviews , all the while concealing their faces . Usually this involves the wearing of a balaclava , but outrageous costumes have been created for the purpose , including Ku Klux Klan uniforms made of newspaper , silver suits with puffy arms and legs to mimic an inflated cask wine bladder , giant foam paintings worn on the head , large foam signs bearing the name of a Beatle , fat ' businessman ' suits , and eight @-@ foot @-@ high inflatable headpieces among others . 
 Who TISM are beneath the masks has been the cause of much speculation by fans , with one theory contending that TISM is composed of members of other bands who do not want their fans to find out : popular targets of this theory include Painters and Dockers , Machine Gun <unk> and even The Wiggles . A theory based on the band 's tour schedule 's roughly coinciding with school holidays , and the fact that the Ringwood Secondary College Choir and Orchestra feature in the <unk> to Thunderbirds Are Coming Out , proposes that TISM are school teachers . Another common theory , based on the high incidence of football references in their lyrics , is that they are Australian rules football players in the AFL , however Humphrey B. Flaubert has stated that " We 're actually not AFL , we 're more violent and crappy ... so you 're looking at the VFL there . " 
 When asked why they wear masks , Flaubert replied : 
 The answer that makes me sound good is that we desired to circumvent the cult of personality that is inherent in rock music by choosing to remain anonymous . Unlike every other band in rock we chose to be anonymous . The answer that makes me sound good would probably also incorporate some lengthy discussion about Brechtian alienation techniques , about our post modernist grasp of ever cooling universe , and a dehumanising society encapsulated in the somewhat paramilitary aspect of our clothing . All of those things would make me sound good , but actually we ’ re really boring guys . " 
 However , when TISM performed on John Safran 's Music Jamboree in 2002 playing " ( He 'll Never Be An ) Ol ' Man River " on instruments from Greece , the song writers ' names were revealed during the credit roll which read " ' ( He 'll Never Be An ) Ol ' Man River ' by Damian Cowell / Peter Minack / Jack Holt / James Paull / Eugene Cester ... Performed by TISM . " Up until then , the songwriters ' names were publicly available on the APRA / <unk> database , but now the songwriting credits on the site just say " TISM " instead of the members ' real names . Damian Cowell 's real name is listed as one of the songwriters of <unk> ! ' s songs , however . 
 The song writers ' names were also published later , alongside information on " Everyone Else Has Had More Sex Than Me " when it hit success in Sweden and Germany in 2004 . 
 However , vigilant fans would have noticed the names years earlier . Hitler @-@ Barassi was photographed in 1993 at the opening night of Madame Butterfly , which was published on 4 April 1993 ; the book revealed the member to be Peter Minack , who later released a book of his own ( Campaigning With Grant ) in 2000 , which was about the American Civil War . The book contains thin references to TISM . In interviews about his book , Minack revealed he was a teacher , his father fought in World War II for the Germans and that he is fanatical about the Richmond Football Club , explaining his stage moniker . 
 TISM bassist Jock Cheese 's real name , John ( Jack ) Holt , can be found on a list of copyright owners on Mushroom Records circa the release of his solo album Platter ( 2002 ) . Guitarist Tokin Blackman 's real name is James " Jock " Paull . He died in mid @-@ 2008 of cancer . 
 Eugene Cester was revealed in an Age column as being the uncle of Nic Cester , lead singer of Melbourne 's Jet , however , it did not state which member he is ; it is believed that he is Eugene De La Hot Croix Bun . 
 On 28 March 2007 , a MySpace page opened for a Melbourne band called Root ! which the lead singer claimed to be " the friend of the uncle of the guys in Jet " . The page also lists James Paull as a " friend " . Humphrey B. Flaubert 's real name is Damian Cowell , who performs in the band as D.C. Root . 
 In the Jock Cheese @-@ penned song " Let 's Club It to Death " from Hot Dogma , Cheese drops his real first name in the first verse ( " My friends call me John / But you can call me Breaker Morant " ) .

 TISM were distinguished from other ' joke ' or ' gimmick bands ' , by , among other things , their musical style . The band rarely in any seriousness stated actual influences on the type of music they played , except that The Residents were a band which TISM ' did ' notice and ' possibly ' took some influence from . A clear link can be drawn from The Residents ' The Third Reich ' n ' Roll video , in which that band wore Ku Klux Klan uniforms made of newspaper : TISM did exactly this at their first gig . Another link may be drawn to early TISM tracks " The Ballad of the Semitic Nazi " or " I 'm Gonna Treat Ya to a <unk> Double Feature " ( sic ) which use a similar naming convention to The Residents . Other bands which may have influenced TISM are difficult to pinpoint , although a Sydney Morning Herald article on the band described them as " a cross between Skyhooks , Dave Warner , Talking Heads and The Residents " . 
 The band were criticised as unoriginal for continually opting for standard pop song structures . One reason for this is clarified in their book , The TISM Guide To Little Aesthetics , in the following paragraphs , when asked why their ideas are post @-@ modern but their music is not : 
 " Give me a pop @-@ song , mate . Give me a fucking pop @-@ song . Not only is it more fun , it 's pretty fuckin ' hard to write as well . You can bung in as many out @-@ of @-@ tune oboes as you want , but putting chords together so they sound pleasant isn 't as simple as it might appear . It <unk> 't be the Sistine Chapel , but what is ? Ollie fucking Olsen with his stupid feedback and cough mixture ? The Jesus and Mary Chain , with their stupid feedback , and their stupid stage show with 800 powerful stupid lights and enough stupid dry ice to enhance their stupid stupidity up its own bullshit crappy teenage pretentious one dimensional dick witted puissant artistic enigma ? 
 So ... what have you listened to for a good time that isn 't , after all , a ' traditional ' song ? Still playing the Mike Oldfield records , huh ? Still whipping <unk> on for a good time ? Wanna count on one hand how many people have fun at a Sonic Youth gig ? I 'm not supporting The <unk> , old man , I 'm just saying that the day some jumped @-@ up over @-@ paid self @-@ important post @-@ modernist <unk> puts his foot upon his Fairlight computer in the middle of his 47 @-@ minute opus " The Silent Forgiveness of the Pig @-@ God " and belts out the chords to " Johnny B. Goode " is the day I 'll join you at the footlights of post @-@ modernism . 
 Besides which , pop songs sell more . " 
 As with most bands , recurring themes were present throughout TISM 's extensive output , the most common being death , violence , fame and prominent figures , drugs , including alcohol , and the Australian Football League . Many of TISM 's lyrics are tinged in fatalism , mocking both the superficial and the sublime side of the human condition and the desire for people to be loved and respected ( even just in the titles of such songs as " If You 're Not Famous at Fourteen , You 're Finished " , " If You 're Ugly , Forget It " and " Everyone Else Has Had More Sex Than Me " ) . 
 TISM 's keyboard sound was provided by an <unk> which keyboardist Eugene Cester ran through a flanger . They mainly used standard tuning ; however , Eb tuning and drop D were employed in some songs . Jock Cheese 's bass was prominent in the songs to a degree that head of Festival Mushroom Records , Michael Parisi , described the sound as " aggressive " and one fan , reviewing Cheese 's solo album Platter , described the basslines as being " heavy " .

 = Italian cruiser Piemonte = 
 Piemonte was a unique protected cruiser built for the Italian Regia Marina ( Royal Navy ) in the 1880s by the British shipyard Armstrong Whitworth . She was the first major warship armed entirely with quick @-@ firing ( QF ) guns and she was also the fastest cruiser in the world upon her completion in 1889 . Piemonte was frequently deployed overseas , including a lengthy tour in East Asian waters from 1901 to 1904 . She saw significant action during the Italo @-@ Turkish War in 1911 – 12 in the Red Sea , where she frequently bombarded Ottoman ports . During the Battle of Kunfuda Bay in January 1912 , she and two destroyers sank four Ottoman gunboats and forced ashore three more . Piemonte participated in World War I but she saw little action during the conflict . She remained in service until 1920 , when she was scrapped . 
 = = Design = = 
 The first design by the newly hired naval architect Philips Watts for Armstrong Whitworth , Piemonte was designed as an improved version of the Italian cruiser Dogali . The ship was built as a speculative venture and was purchased by Italy on 30 July 1888 for delivery in six months . Her intended armament consisted of two 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) and four 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) guns , all breech @-@ loading weapons , but the Italians insisted that she be equipped with six 6 @-@ inch QF guns . The changes to the magazines and the addition of large sponsons to accommodate the QF guns significantly delayed her completion . Piemonte was the first major warship to be armed with medium @-@ caliber , quick @-@ firing guns ; these weapons would become the standard armament for cruisers in the 1890s . 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 Piemonte was 310 feet ( 94 @.@ 5 m ) between perpendiculars , with a beam of 38 feet ( 11 @.@ 6 m ) . She had a mean draft of 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) and displaced 2 @,@ 473 long tons ( 2 @,@ 513 t ) . The ship had a crew of 12 officers and 245 enlisted crew . Piemonte was fitted with two heavy military masts and had a partial double bottom . The large sponsons extended down to about a foot ( 305 millimeters ) of the water and proved to be very wet in service . She proved to be rather <unk> for her size and her freeboard was only 8 feet 3 inches ( 2 @.@ 51 m ) a normal load and 6 feet 9 inches ( 2 @.@ 06 m ) at deep load . 
 The ship was powered by two 4 @-@ cylinder Humphrys , Tennant vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving one propeller shaft . The stroke of her engines was 27 inches ( 690 mm ) and the bores of their cylinders were 36 inches ( 910 mm ) , 55 inches ( 1 @,@ 400 mm ) and 60 inches ( 1 @,@ 500 mm ) . The low @-@ pressure cylinder of Piemonte ' engines was split in two for smoother running and she was the first warship thus equipped . Steam for the engines was supplied by four double @-@ ended Scotch marine boilers at a pressure of 155 psi ( 1 @,@ 069 kPa ; 11 kgf / cm2 ) and their exhausts were trunked into a pair of funnels amidships . Designed for a maximum output of 12 @,@ 000 indicated horsepower ( 8 @,@ 900 kW ) , her engines produced 7 @,@ 040 ihp ( 5 @,@ 250 kW ) , using natural draught , and gave the ship a speed of 20 @.@ 4 knots ( 37 @.@ 8 km / h ; 23 @.@ 5 mph ) during her sea trials in May 1889 . Using forced draught increased her engine output to 12 @,@ 600 ihp ( 9 @,@ 400 kW ) and her speed to 22 @.@ 3 knots ( 41 @.@ 3 km / h ; 25 @.@ 7 mph ) . This made her the fastest cruiser in the world . The ship normally embarked a total of 200 long tons ( 203 t ) of coal , but could carry a maximum of 600 long tons ( 610 t ) . Piemonte had a cruising radius of about 7 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 13 @,@ 000 km ; 8 @,@ 100 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . At full speed , she could steam for 1 @,@ 950 nmi ( 3 @,@ 610 km ; 2 @,@ 240 mi ) . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Piemonte was armed with a main battery of six 6 @-@ inch L / 40 guns in single mounts . One gun was placed forward and one aft , with two on each broadside abreast of the masts . These guns were mounted in sponsons to allow direct ahead and astern firing . They were supported by a secondary battery of six 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 120 mm ) L / 40 guns in single mounts , three on each side between the 15 cm guns . Light weapons included ten 57 @-@ millimeter ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) 6 @-@ pounder Hotchkiss L / 40 guns , six 37 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) 1 @-@ pounder Hotchkiss L / 20 guns , and four 10 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 39 in ) Maxim machine guns . Four of 1 @-@ pounder and all of the machine guns were mounted in the military masts . She was also equipped with 14 @-@ inch ( 356 mm ) torpedo tubes . One was mounted in the bow and the other two were on the broadside in rotating mounts , all above water . 
 Armor protection consisted of a sloped deck that ranged in thickness from 1 inch ( 25 mm ) on the flat and 2 – 3 inches ( 51 – 76 mm ) on the slopes . The armor protecting her conning tower consisted of three inches of steel plating . The guns of her main and secondary armament were protected by gun shields 4 @.@ 5 inches ( 110 mm ) thick . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Piemonte was built by the British shipyard Armstrong Whitworth in Elswick . Her keel was laid down in 1887 and she was launched on 23 August 1888 . After completing fitting @-@ out work , the new cruiser was completed on 8 September 1889 and delivered to the Regia Marina . In 1890 , Piemonte participated in the annual fleet maneuvers in the First Squadron , along with the ironclad Lepanto , Dogali , and several torpedo boats . The exercises were conducted in the Tyrrhenian Sea , where the First Squadron was tasked with defending against an attacking " hostile " squadron . By 1891 , the Italian Navy had determined that Piemonte 's armament was too heavy , and so the four broadside 6 @-@ inch guns were replaced with lighter 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch guns and their sponsons removed . In addition , the heavy military masts were replaced by light pole masts . In the following years , the ship served in the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean in addition to the Mediterranean . In mid @-@ 1896 , violence against Italians in Brazil prompted the Italian government to dispatch Piemonte on a mission to secure the interests of Italian nationals in the country . The attempt at gunboat diplomacy secured an official apology from the Brazilian government , as well as an arrangement to adjudicate Italian claims of damages by the United States ' and German ambassadors . 
 In late 1901 , Piemonte was assigned to the East Asian station after a year @-@ long modernization . She passed through the Suez Canal and the Red Sea and stopped to coal in British Aden while en route to Asian waters . In September 1902 she was in Nagasaki , Japan , with the Italian cruiser Lombardia . Piemonte met the British cruiser HMS Talbot in the British colony at Weihaiwei . A party of officers and men from Piemonte visited the British ship on 28 July . That year , she was joined by the armored cruiser Vettor Pisani and the protected cruiser Elba . The following year , the armored cruiser Marco Polo and the protected cruiser Puglia were scheduled to replace Vettor Pisani and Piemonte , respectively , but due to the outbreak of the Russo @-@ Japanese War on 8 February 1904 , Piemonte remained in the region . On 24 February , Piemonte arrived in Seoul and landed a contingent of infantry to augment the guards at the Italian embassy . Piemonte was finally recalled to Italy in April ; she stopped in Singapore on 22 April to coal , departing two days later for home . 
 By 1908 , Piemonte had been assigned as the flagship of the torpedo flotilla of the main fleet , which consisted of seventeen destroyers and fifty first and second class torpedo boats . In August that year , Piemonte participated in the annual summer maneuvers of the Italian fleet . She was assigned to a squadron and was tasked with defending against an opponent fleet that attempted to force an amphibious landing . The maneuvers were modeled on a potential war with Italy 's nominal ally Austria @-@ Hungary , and the fact that the relative strengths of the two squadrons mirrored the Italian and Austro @-@ Hungarian navies was not lost on analysts in Vienna . The Maneuvers concluded with a fleet review on 18 October . Piemonte then spent 1909 deployed again to the Far East . 
 = = = Italo @-@ Turkish War = = = 
 At the outbreak of the Italo @-@ Turkish War in September 1911 , Piemonte was stationed in the Red Sea with four other cruisers . In December , she and the other cruisers patrolled the Ottoman ports in the Red Sea for ships that might be preparing to carry a rumored invasion force across the narrow sea to Italian Eritrea . Hostilities were temporarily ceased while the British King George V passed through the Red Sea following his coronation ceremony in India — the ceasefire lasted until 26 November . 
 In early 1912 , the Italian Red Sea Fleet searched for a group of seven Ottoman gunboats thought to be planning an attack on Eritrea , though they were in fact immobilized due to a lack of coal . Piemonte and the destroyers Artigliere and Garibaldino searched for the gunboats while the cruisers Calabria and Puglia carried out diversionary bombardments against Jebl Tahr , and Al Luḩayyah . On 7 January , they found the gunboats and quickly sank four in the Battle of Kunfuda Bay ; the other three were forced to beach to avoid sinking as well . The next day , the Italian warships sent a shore party to destroy the grounded gunboats . 
 Piemonte and the rest of the Italian ships returned to bombarding the Turkish ports in the Red Sea before declaring a blockade of the city of Al Hudaydah on 26 January . Piemonte accidentally damaged the railroad that was being built by a French company when she bombarded the port of <unk> . As a result , the French firm sued the Italian government for the sum of 200 @,@ 000 lire . By April , Piemonte was serving as the flagship of the Italian squadron in the Red Sea . On 27 July and 12 August , Piemonte , the torpedo cruisers Caprera and Aretusa conducted two bombardments of Al Hudaydah . During the 12 August attack , they destroyed an Ottoman ammunition dump . Piemonte thereafter left the Red Sea with four destroyers . The Ottomans eventually agreed to surrender in October , ending the war . 
 = = = Later career = = = 
 Then @-@ Lieutenant Alessandro <unk> proposed in 1912 to convert Piemonte into an aircraft carrier capable of operating seaplanes and fixed @-@ wheel aircraft . His projected reconstruction would have seen an inclined flight deck erected on the aft half of the ship , tall enough to clear the ships ' funnels . The Regia Marina were not interested in operating wheeled aircraft at sea and so the idea was not pursued . In 1913 , the last two of the ship 's 6 @-@ inch guns were replaced with 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch guns in another attempt to lighten the ship . 
 When Italy entered World War I on 23 May 1915 , Piemonte was based in Brindisi and was assigned to the Second Fleet , which included the Regina Elena and Regina Margherita @-@ class pre @-@ dreadnought battleships and the Pisa and San Giorgio @-@ class armored cruisers . The primary naval opponent for the duration of the war was the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy ; the Naval Chief of Staff , Admiral Paolo Thaon di Revel , planned a distant blockade with the battle fleet , while smaller vessels , such as the MAS boats conducted raids . The heavy ships of the Italian fleet would be preserved for a potential major battle in the Austro @-@ Hungarian fleet should emerge from its bases . As a result , the ship 's activities during the war was limited and she spent much of it based at Salonica , Greece as part of the Anglo @-@ French Levant Squadron . Plans to use her for torpedo trials after the war came to nothing and Piemonte was stricken from the Navy List on 15 May 1920 and broken up shortly afterwards . 
 = Operation Pig Bristle = 
 Operation Pig Bristle was an unusual transport task conducted by the Royal Australian Air Force ( RAAF ) in May 1946 . The operation was ordered by the Australian Government in response to a national shortage of paint brushes , which was hindering house @-@ building efforts . No. 38 Squadron of the RAAF was given the task of transporting 25 tonnes of pig bristles from Chongqing in China to Hong Kong , from where the bristles were shipped to Australia . The squadron completed this task over a two @-@ week period . 
 = = Background = = 
 Following World War II , the Australian Commonwealth and state governments launched a joint Commonwealth Housing Scheme to address a national shortage of accommodation . This scheme , and private sector house @-@ building activities , was delayed by a shortage of materials , including pig bristles needed to manufacture paint brushes . 
 At the time , the only available source of pig bristles was China . In 1946 , the company Jardine Matheson acquired 100 tonnes ( 98 long tons ; 110 short tons ) of bristles for the British government and a further 25 tonnes ( 25 long tons ; 28 short tons ) for Australia from remote locations in China near the border with Tibet . These stocks were transported to Chongqing , the capital of the Kuomintang government , and Jardine Matheson eventually gained permission to export them to Australia and Britain . This supply of bristles would be sufficient to meet Australia 's needs for several months . 
 As the Chinese Civil War was raging at the time and Communist forces were attacking river boats travelling from Chongqing , it was judged necessary to transport the pig bristles from the city by air . The Kuomintang government agreed to allow RAAF and Royal Air Force aircraft to fly return flights between Hong Kong and Chongqing between 1 and 14 May only . After arriving in Hong Kong , the bristles would be shipped to Australia by sea . Both the Kuomintang government and the Communist forces were concerned about the presence of foreigners in China , and the Australian aircrew were warned that they would be imprisoned if they landed anywhere other than Chongqing or an emergency airstrip at Canton . 
 = = Operation = = 
 The RAAF 's No. 38 Squadron was selected to transport Australia 's share of the bristles . This squadron was equipped with Douglas Dakota aircraft , and was responsible at the time for conducting regular flights from Australia to Japan carrying personnel and supplies for the Australian element of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force . A detachment of three Dakotas led by No. 38 Squadron 's commanding officer , Squadron Leader John Balfe , was sent from Australia to Hong Kong in preparation for the task . As flying conditions were expected to be difficult , each of these aircraft was manned by two highly experienced pilots as well as another airman who performed the duties of navigator , radio operator and flight engineer . 
 The flights from Hong Kong to Chongqing began in early May 1946 . At this time Chongqing had been isolated by Communist forces , and foreign embassies were being evacuated from the city ahead of its expected occupation by the Communists . No navigation aids were available to guide the Australian aircraft , and their crews had to use inaccurate road maps for navigation during the 1 @,@ 100 @-@ kilometre ( 680 mi ) trips between Chongqing and Hong Kong . The RAAF aircrew found the flights between Hong Kong and Chongqing to be challenging as a result of mountains around the Chinese city , as well as the expected lack of accurate weather forecasts and navigation aids . As the Australian legation was evacuated from Chongqing in early May , the RAAF aircrew slept at the British embassy when they needed to overnight in the city . The detachment was successful in flying out the pig bristles within the two weeks available , with eight return flights being made to Chongqing . In his memoirs Balfe attributed this success to " reasonable weather and everyone 's enthusiasm " . After completing their task , the three Dakotas left Hong Kong bound for Australia on 14 May . 
 = = Delivery = = 
 Some of the pig bristles were rushed to Australia on board No. 38 Squadron aircraft , and the remainder were transported from Hong Kong by sea . On 29 May it was reported that the shortage of pig bristles had been overcome . One of the pilots involved in Operation Pig Bristle received the Air Force Cross in the 1948 New Years Honours in recognition of his role in the operation .

 The 2004 Emerald Bowl was a post @-@ season college football bowl game between the New Mexico Lobos and the Navy Midshipmen on December 30 , 2004 at SBC Park in San Francisco , California , United States . The game , which Navy won with a final score of 34 – 19 , was highlighted by a 26 @-@ play drive from the Midshipmen that took up almost 15 minutes of game time and set the record for the longest drive in a National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) college football game . The contest was the third time the Emerald Bowl was played and the final game of the 2004 NCAA football season for both teams . 
 The conference independent Navy Midshipmen , who finished the regular season with a 9 – 2 record , accepted an invitation to play in the game on November 22 , 2004 . Eight days later , the 7 – 4 New Mexico Lobos agreed to fill the open spot reserved for a Mountain West Conference team . Leading up to the game , sports writers predicted that a major highlight of the contest would be the rushing offenses of Midshipmen head coach Paul Johnson and Lobos head coach Rocky Long ; both teams ranked in the top rushing offenses in the Football Bowl Subdivision ( FBS ) . The Lobos also ranked as one of the nation 's top rushing defenses . 
 The game began at 1 : 35 p.m. PST in rainy conditions that had affected the San Francisco Bay Area for days before the contest . The Lobos scored a touchdown on the game 's first drive to take an early lead , but the Midshipmen scored three touchdowns to bring the score to 21 – 7 early in the second quarter . After the Lobos narrowed that lead to 12 points by the end of the third quarter , the Midshipmen began a long drive which took up much of the fourth quarter . The drive ended with a field goal , which gave Navy a 15 @-@ point lead with a little over two minutes remaining in the game . On the next drive from the Lobos , the Midshipmen forced a turnover on downs and ran out the clock with their last possession to win the game . 
 Midshipmen players Aaron Polanco and Vaughn Kelley were named the game 's offensive and defensive Most Valuable Players , respectively . The win caused the Midshipmen to finish the season with a 10 – 2 record , their best record since the 1905 season . After the game , the Associated Press College Poll and the USA Today Coaches ' Poll ranked the team as the 24th best in the nation . The loss caused the Lobos ' record to fall to 7 – 5 .

 First played in 2002 when it was called the Diamond Walnut San Francisco Bowl , organizers announced a new name in May 2004 for that year 's iteration of the annual game for the 2004 – 05 NCAA football bowl season . The new title for the game was derived from the Emerald Nuts brand owned by the game 's primary sponsor , Diamond Foods . Originally , the game was to feature the sixth bowl eligible team from the Pacific @-@ 10 Conference and the third eligible team from the Mountain West Conference .

 Since only two teams from the Pacific @-@ 10 Conference had become bowl eligible near the end of the 2004 NCAA Division I @-@ A football season , organizers looked to the United States Naval Academy Midshipmen , who were not a member of any athletic conference , to fill the open spot . The team accepted their invitation to play in the Emerald Bowl on November 22 , two days after defeating the Rutgers Scarlet Knights with a score of 54 – 21 to earn an 8 – 2 record . The Midshipmen had originally intended to play in the 2004 Liberty Bowl , but chose the Emerald Bowl when it looked as though Liberty Bowl organizers were seeking a matchup of more " high @-@ powered offenses " . After defeating the Army Black Knights with a score of 42 – 13 in that year 's Army – Navy Game , the Midshipmen ended the regular season with a record of 9 – 2 , the first time since the 1963 college football season that Navy had won nine or more games in a season . Wins over Army and the Air Force Falcons secured Navy 's second consecutive Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief 's Trophy . Navy 's previous bowl game , the 2003 Houston Bowl , had ended in a 38 – 14 loss to the Texas Tech Red Raiders .

 The University of New Mexico Lobos accepted the game 's other invitation on December 30 , 2004 . The Lobos finished the regular season with five straight wins , culminating in a 16 – 9 win over conference rival Wyoming to finish with a record of 7 – 4 . The game marked the first time in the program 's history the team had played in three straight bowl games , having lost in the 2002 and 2003 editions of the Las Vegas Bowl to the UCLA Bruins and the Oregon State Beavers , respectively . The bowl game was the first meeting between was the two teams .

 Prior to the game , spread bettors favored the New Mexico Lobos by a single point . Given both teams ' propensity for running the ball and the rainy weather conditions that had affected the San Francisco area for days prior to the game , analysts expected that it would center around both teams ' rushing offenses . The Baltimore Sun sports writer Kent Baker predicted that " the teams ' non @-@ reliance on the pass will serve both well . The game should be fairly low scoring and rapidly played , with the Midshipmen eking out a victory . " 
 = = = Navy = = = 
 The Midshipmen triple option rushing offense , including future National Football League ( NFL ) fullback Kyle Eckel , ranked third among FBS teams in total rushing yards and averaged 291 rushing yards per game . The Midshipmen passing offense , however , ranked 116th out of 117 FBS teams . Using a 3 – 4 defensive scheme , the Midshipmen had experienced mixed levels of defensive success . Although the defensive backs had set a team record for interceptions returned for touchdowns during the season , analysts and fans criticized the squad for a 42 – 10 loss to the Tulane Green Wave . Special teams play was a noted weakness for Navy ; kicker Geoff Blumenfeld had missed seven of ten field goal attempts during the season , including three at distances shorter than 30 yards . The Midshipmen , who had recently completed rigorous midterm exams , were also mourning the death of former teammate J. P. <unk> , who had been killed at the Second Battle of Fallujah in the Iraq war in November .

 The Lobos also relied heavily on their rushing offense . Running back DonTrell Moore had gained 3 @,@ 667 career yards and averaged 106 rushing yards per game coming into the contest . When both Moore and quarterback Kole McKamey played for the Lobos , the team had a record of 6 – 1 , averaging 21 @.@ 4 offensive points per game ; however , when either player was sidelined with an injury , the team 's record dropped to 1 – 3 and the offense averaged 10 @.@ 3 points per game . The Lobos ' passing offense also ranked near the bottom of the FBS , at 115th . Wide receiver Hank Baskett led the team with 49 receptions for 793 yards during the season . The Lobos entered the bowl game with the eighth best rushing defense in the country , allowing an average of 93 @.@ 6 rushing yards per game . The team had allowed 107 yards of rushing offense in its previous four games combined ; it ranked first in the Mountain West Conference in fewest points allowed and most sacks , and had not allowed a rushing touchdown it its last five games . With a win , Lobos head coach Rocky Long would set a team record for most wins as a head coach .

 The 2004 Emerald Bowl began with a 1 : 35 p.m. PST kickoff time in SBC Park . Because the field had been converted from the baseball diamond typically used by the San Francisco Giants , both teams shared the same sideline during the game .

Although 30 @,@ 563 tickets were sold , an increase of 19 percent from the 2003 game , official in @-@ stadium attendance was listed at 28 @,@ 856 , an increase of 28 percent over the previous year .

On the following drive from the Lobos , running back DonTrell Moore tore his anterior cruciate ligament ( ACL ) when Midshipmen cornerback Vaughn Kelley made a low tackle . Moore fumbled the ball as he was tackled , and did not return for the remainder of the game . Midshipmen linebacker Lane Jackson recovered the fumble . On the Midshipmen 's next drive , running back Frank Divis executed a halfback option pass trick play to Polanco for 17 yards , the team 's biggest gain of the first quarter .

The Lobos moved 48 yards over the course of eight plays and almost five minutes of game time , but the team committed a turnover on downs inches away from the goal line when running back D.D.

 Continuing Navy 's drive from the previous quarter , Polanco and Eckel continued to run up the middle and the right side of New Mexico 's defense for small gains .

After 12 plays and over six minutes of game time , the drive reached midfield . After six more rushing plays from Polanco , Eckel , and slotback Eric Roberts , the team reached the Lobos ' 28 @-@ yard line .

 The Lobos gained three more first downs on their final drive , but were unable to score again before turning the ball over on downs . The Midshipmen ran one more quarterback kneel play to run out the clock , winning the game with a final score of 34 – 19 .

 Though the Lobos gained more first downs and yards on offense than the Midshipmen , their three turnovers and Navy 's extended drive in the third and fourth quarters led to the lopsided final score . The 14 @-@ minute , 26 @-@ second final drive from the Midshipmen , measured by its 26 total plays , set a record for the longest drive in a game . Prior to the contest , the NCAA had not kept a record for longest drive , but began keeping track for the 2005 edition of the record book . No drive in either college football or in the NFL has exceeded the record in terms of total plays or in time of possession since the game was played . At post @-@ game press conferences , both coaches discussed the characteristics of the drive : 
 I think that you have to give the defense on the other side some credit because they kept us out of the end zone and we had 26 plays . I wasn 't a lot of big plays , it was four yards , five yards . Running the clock was kinda just what the doctor ordered at that point in the game . 
 I 've never seen a drive like that ... In fact it wasn 't even as if we were playing bad defense . I think their average gain was 3 @.@ 6 yards ; we just couldn 't make them punt . 
 Midshipmen quarterback Aaron Polanco was named as the offensive Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) of the game , finishing the contest with 101 passing yards and 136 rushing yards , a new team bowl record for the Midshipmen . Polanco also had two receptions for 23 yards , achieving the rare feat of leading his team in rushing yards , passing yards , and receptions . Polanco finished the season with 16 touchdowns , more than any other quarterback in the nation . Additionally , Midshipmen fullback Kyle Eckel ran for 85 yards on 24 carries , becoming the Midshipmen 's fourth @-@ leading rusher of all time . Navy cornerback Vaughn Kelley had nine tackles in the game , including the forced fumble in the first quarter , and was named as the defensive MVP of the game . Navy kicker Geoff Blumenfeld exceeded analysts ' expectations by making all three of his field goal attempts during the game , and New Mexico kicker Wes <unk> missed his first extra point attempt after 46 consecutive conversions , one away from the school record .

 The win lifted the Midshipmen 's record for that season to 10 – 2 , Navy 's second 10 @-@ win season in its history and first in 99 years . It was the first bowl game victory for the Midshipmen since the 1996 Aloha Bowl . As a result of the win , the team finished the season ranked 24th in both the Associated Press and USA Today Coaches ' Poll , the first time since 1978 that the Midshipmen finished the season ranked in any major poll . For his coaching accomplishments that year , head coach Paul Johnson was awarded the 2004 Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award . The next season , Navy played in the inaugural 2005 Poinsettia Bowl , defeating the Colorado State Rams 51 – 30 . In November 2012 , Navy accepted an invitation to Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl , the newest name for the Emerald Bowl , based on the team 's positive experiences from this game . 
 The Lobos ended the season with a 7 – 5 record , finishing second in the Mountain West Conference behind the Utah Utes . After undergoing surgery to repair his ACL , running back DonTrell Moore returned to compete for the 2005 New Mexico Lobos football team , becoming the sixth college player to rush for over 1 @,@ 000 yards for four straight seasons . The team finished with a 6 – 5 record in 2005 , but did not play in a bowl game .

 Dirty Dancing is in large part based on screenwriter Eleanor Bergstein 's own childhood : she is the younger daughter of a Jewish doctor from New York , spent summers with her family in the Catskills , participated in " Dirty Dancing " competitions , and was herself called " Baby " as a girl . In 1980 , Bergstein wrote a screenplay for the Michael Douglas film , It 's My Turn . However , the producers cut an erotic dancing scene from the script , much to her dismay . She then conceived a new story , focused almost exclusively on dancing . In 1984 , she pitched the idea to MGM executive Eileen <unk> , who liked it and teamed Bergstein with producer Linda Gottlieb . They set the film in 1963 , with the character of Baby based on Bergstein 's own life , and the character of Johnny based on the stories of Michael Terrace , a dance instructor whom Bergstein met in the Catskills in 1985 while she was researching the story . She finished the script in November 1985 , but management changes at MGM put the script into turnaround , or limbo . 
 Bergstein then shopped the script around to other studios but was repeatedly rejected , until she brought it to Vestron Pictures , the newly formed studio division of Stamford , Connecticut , based Vestron Inc . , the leading independent home video distribution company . While honing their pitch to Vestron , Gottlieb and Bergstein chose as the film 's director Emile Ardolino , who had won the 1983 Academy Award for the documentary , He Makes Me Feel Like Dancin ' . Ardolino had never directed a feature film but was extremely passionate about the project ; he even sent a message from where he was sequestered on jury duty , insisting that he was the best choice as director . The team of Gottlieb , Bergstein , and Ardolino then presented their vision for the film to Vestron 's president , Jon <unk> , and the company 's vice president for production , Mitchell <unk> . By the end of the meeting , <unk> had given the project the " green light " to become Vestron 's first feature film production . The approved film was budgeted at the relatively low amount of $ 5 million , at a time when the average cost for a film was $ 12 million . 
 For choreographer , Bergstein chose Kenny Ortega , who had been trained by Gene Kelly . For a location , they did not find anything suitable in the Catskills ( as many of the resorts had been shut down at that point ) , so they decided on a combination of two locations : Lake Lure , North Carolina and the Mountain Lake Hotel near Roanoke , Virginia , and with careful editing made it look like all shooting was done in the same area . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Director Ardolino was adamant that they choose dancers who could also act , as he did not want to use the " stand @-@ in " method that had been used with Flashdance ( 1983 ) . For the female lead of Frances " Baby " Houseman , Bergstein chose the 26 @-@ year @-@ old Jennifer Grey , daughter of the Oscar @-@ winning actor and dancer Joel Grey ( e.g. , of the film Cabaret ( 1972 ) ) , who , like her father , was a trained dancer . They then sought a male lead , initially considering 20 @-@ year @-@ old Billy Zane , who had the visual look desired ( originally the Johnny character was to be Italian and have a dark exotic look ) , but initial dancing tests when he was partnered with Grey did not meet expectations . The next choice was 34 @-@ year @-@ old Patrick Swayze , who had been noticed for his roles in Grandview , U.S.A. ( 1984 ) and Red Dawn ( 1984 ) . He was a seasoned dancer , with experience from the Joffrey Ballet . The producers were thrilled with him , but his agent was opposed to the idea . However , Swayze read the script , liked the multi @-@ level character of Johnny , and took the part anyway , and Johnny was changed from being Italian to Irish . Grey was initially not happy about the choice , as she and Swayze had had difficulty getting along on Red Dawn , but when they did their dancing screen test , the chemistry between them was obvious . Bergstein described it as " breathtaking " . 
 Other casting choices were Broadway actor Jerry Orbach as Dr. Jake Houseman , Baby 's father ; and Jane Brucker as Lisa Houseman , her older sister . Bergstein also attempted to cast her friend , sex therapist Dr. Ruth Westheimer , to play Mrs. Schumacher , and Joel Grey as her husband . However , Westheimer backed out when she learned the role involved being a thief . The role went instead to 79 @-@ year @-@ old Paula Trueman , and Joel Grey was not cast . Another role went to Bergstein 's friend , New York radio personality " Cousin Brucie " . She initially wanted him to portray the social director but then later asked him to play the part of the magician . The role of the social director went to the then unknown Wayne Knight ( of later Seinfeld and 3rd Rock from the Sun fame ) . The part of Baby 's mother was originally given to Lynne Lipton , who is briefly visible in the beginning , when the Houseman family first pulls into Kellerman 's ( she is in the front seat for a few seconds ; her blonde hair is the only indication ) , but she became ill during the first week of shooting and was replaced by actress Kelly Bishop , who had already been cast to play Vivian Pressman , the highly sexed resort guest . Bishop moved into the role of Mrs. Houseman , and the film 's assistant choreographer Miranda Garrison took on the role of Vivian . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Principal photography for Dirty Dancing took place in Lake Lure , North Carolina , and Mountain Lake , Virginia . Scenes in Lake Lure were filmed at the old Boys Camp , which is now a private , residential community known as Firefly Cove . These scenes included the interior dancing scenes , Baby carrying the watermelon and practicing on the signature stairs , Johnny 's cabin , the staff cabins , the golf scene where Baby asks her father for $ 250 , and the " lift " in the water . Scenes filmed at Mountain Lake included the dining scenes , Kellerman 's Hotel , the beach games , Penny crying in the kitchen , and the Houseman family 's cabins . 
 The tight schedule allowed only two weeks for rehearsal and 44 days for filming , as it was already the tail end of summer . The cast stayed in the same hotel at Mountain Lake Lodge in Pembroke , Virginia and at the 1927 Lake Lure Inn & Spa in Lake Lure , N.C. Rehearsals quickly turned into disco parties involving nearly every cast member , even non @-@ dancers such as Jack Weston . 
 The dancing and drinking went on almost non @-@ stop and , immersed in the environment , the lead actors , Grey and Swayze , began identifying with their characters . Bergstein built upon this , encouraging the actors to improvise in their scenes . She also built the sexual tension by saying that no matter how intimate or " grinding " the dance steps , that none of the dancers were to have any other kind of physical contact with each other for the next six months . 
 Filming started on September 5 , 1986 but was plagued by the weather , which ranged from pouring rain to sweltering heat . The outside temperature rose to 105 ° F ( 41 ° C ) , and with all the additional camera and lighting equipment needed for filming , the temperature inside could be as high as 120 ° F ( 49 ° C ) . According to choreographer Kenny Ortega , on one day 10 people passed out within 25 minutes of shooting . The elderly Paula Trueman collapsed and was taken to the local emergency room to be treated for dehydration . Patrick Swayze also required a hospital visit ; insisting on doing his own stunts , he repeatedly fell off the log during the " balancing " scene and injured his knee so badly he had to have fluid drained from the swelling . 
 Delays in the shooting schedule pushed filming into the autumn , which required the set decorators to spray @-@ paint the autumn leaves green . The uncooperative weather then took a different turn , plunging from oppressive heat to down near 40 ° F ( 4 ° C ) , causing frigid conditions for the famous swimming scene in October . The crew wore warm coats , gloves , and boots . Swayze and Grey stripped down to light summer clothing , to repeatedly dive into the cold water . Despite her character 's enjoyment , Grey later described the water as " horrifically " cold , and she might not have gone into the lake , except that she was " young and hungry " . 
 Relations between the two main stars varied throughout production . They had already had trouble getting along in their previous project , Red Dawn ( 1984 ) , and worked things out enough to have an extremely positive screen test , but that initial cooperation soon faded , and they were soon " facing off " before every scene . There was concern among the production staff that the animosity between the two stars would endanger the filming of the love scenes . To address this , producer Bergstein and director Ardolino forced the stars to re @-@ watch their initial screen @-@ tests — the ones with the " breathtaking " chemistry . This had the desired effect , and Swayze and Grey were able to return to the film with renewed energy and enthusiasm . 
 Director Ardolino encouraged the actors to improvise and often kept the cameras rolling , even if actors went " off script " . One example of this was the scene where Grey was to stand in front of Swayze with her back to him and put her arm up behind his head while he trailed his fingers down her arm ( similar to the pose seen in the movie poster ) . Though it was written as a serious and tender moment , Grey was exhausted , found the move <unk> , and could not stop giggling each time Swayze tried it , no matter how many takes Ardolino asked for . Swayze was impatient to finish the scene and found Grey 's behavior annoying . However , the producers decided the scene worked as it was and put it into the film , complete with Grey 's giggling and Swayze 's annoyed expression . It became one of the most famous scenes in the movie , turning out , as choreographer Kenny Ortega put it , " as one of the most delicate and honest moments in the film . "

 The shooting wrapped on October 27 , 1986 , both on @-@ time and on @-@ budget . No one on the team , however , liked the rough cut that was put together , and Vestron executives were convinced the film was going to be a flop . Thirty @-@ nine percent of people who viewed the film did not realize abortion was the subplot . In May 1987 , the film was screened for producer Aaron Russo . According to Vestron executive Mitchell <unk> , Russo 's reaction at the end was to say simply , " Burn the negative , and collect the insurance . " 
 Further disputes arose over whether a corporate sponsor could be found to promote the film . Marketers of the Clearasil acne product liked the film , seeing it as a vehicle to reach a teen target audience . However , when they learned the film contained an abortion scene , they asked for that part of the plot to be cut . As Bergstein refused , the Clearasil promotion was dropped . Consequently , Vestron promoted the film themselves and set the premiere on August 16 , 1987 . The Vestron executives had planned to release the film in theaters for a weekend , and then send it to home video , since Vestron had been in the video distribution business before film production . Considering how many people disliked the film at that point , producer Gottlieb 's recollection of her feelings at the time was , " I would have only been grateful , if when it was released , people didn 't yell at me . "

 The film received positive reviews from critics . Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the film a score of 72 % based on reviews from 57 critics , with a rating average of 6 @.@ 1 out of 10 . 
 For the film 's opening , the August 16 , 1987 edition of The New York Times published a major review , with a headline reading , " Dirty Dancing Rocks to an Innocent Beat . " The Times reviewer called the film " a metaphor for America in the summer of 1963 – orderly , prosperous , bursting with good intentions , a sort of Yiddish @-@ inflected Camelot . " Other reviews were more mixed : Gene Siskel gave the film a " marginal Thumbs Up " as he liked Jennifer Grey 's acting and development of her character , while Roger Ebert gave it " Thumbs Down " due to its " idiot plot " , calling it a " tired and relentlessly predictable story of love between kids from different backgrounds . " TIME magazine was lukewarm , saying , " If the ending of Eleanor Bergstein 's script is too neat and inspirational , the rough energy of the film 's song and dance does carry one along , past the whispered doubts of better judgment . " In a retrospective review , Jezebel 's <unk> Carmon called the film " the greatest movie of all time " as " a great , brave movie for women " with " some subtle , retrospectively sharp @-@ eyed critiques of class and gender . " 
 The film drew adult audiences instead of the expected teens , with viewers rating the film highly . Many filmgoers , after seeing the film once , went right back into the theater to watch it a second time . Word @-@ of @-@ mouth promotion took the film to the number one position in the United States , and in 10 days it had broken the $ 10 million mark . By November , it was also achieving international fame . Within seven months of release , it had brought in $ 63 million domestically and boosted attendance in dance classes across America . It was one of the highest @-@ grossing films of 1987 , earning $ 170 million worldwide . 
 The film 's popularity continued to grow after its initial release . It was the number one video rental of 1988 and became the first film to sell a million copies on video . When the film was re @-@ released in 1997 , ten years after its original release , Swayze received his own star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame , and videos were still selling at the rate of over 40 @,@ 000 per month . As of 2005 , it was selling a million DVDs per year , with over ten million copies sold as of 2007 . 
 A May 2007 survey by Britain 's Sky Movies listed Dirty Dancing as number one on " Women 's most @-@ watched films " , above the Star Wars trilogy , Grease , The Sound of Music , and Pretty Woman . The film 's popularity has also caused it to be called " the Star Wars for girls . " An April 2008 article in Britain 's Daily Mail listed Dirty Dancing as number one on a list of " most romantic movie quotes ever " , for Baby 's line : " I 'm scared of walking out of this room and never feeling the rest of my whole life the way I feel when I 'm with you . " 
 The film 's music has also had considerable impact . The closing song , " ( I 've Had ) The Time of My Life " , has been listed as the " third most popular song played at funerals " in the UK .

 = = Music = = 
 Rehearsals for the dancing , and some filming , used music from Bergstein 's personal collection of gramophone records . When it came time to select actual music for the film , Vestron chose Jimmy Ienner as music supervisor . Ienner , who had previously produced albums and songs for John Lennon and Three Dog Night , opted to stick with much of the music that had already been used during filming and obtained licenses for the songs from Bergstein 's collection . He also enlisted Swayze to sing the new song " She 's Like the Wind " . Swayze had written the song a few years earlier with Stacy <unk> , originally intending for it to be used in the film Grandview , U.S.A. ( 1984 ) . 
 John Morris composed the film 's score . The lyrics for the <unk> ' song that closes the talent show were written specifically for the film and were sung to the tune of " Annie Lisle " , a commonly used theme for school alma <unk> . Kenny Ortega and his assistant Miranda Garrison chose the song for the finale by going through an entire box of tapes , listening to each one . According to Ortega , literally the last tape they listened to had " The Time of My Life " , which they saw as the obvious choice . Ienner then insisted that Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes record it . The song won the 1988 Grammy Award for Best Pop Performance by a Duo or Group , an Academy Award for Best Original Song , and the Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song . 
 The film 's soundtrack started an oldies music revival , and demand for the album caught RCA Records by surprise . According to Franke Previte , before a single had even been released , there were a million albums on back @-@ order . The Dirty Dancing album spent 18 weeks at number one on the Billboard 200 album sales charts and went platinum eleven times , selling more than 32 million copies worldwide . It spawned a follow @-@ up multi @-@ platinum album in February 1988 , entitled More Dirty Dancing . 
 Songs from the album which appeared on the charts included : 
 " ( I 've Had ) The Time of My Life " , performed by Bill Medley and Jennifer Warnes , composed by Franke Previte , John <unk> , and Donald Markowitz – this song rose to # 1 on the pop charts . 
 " She 's Like the Wind " , performed by lead actor Patrick Swayze , composed by Lee and Stacy <unk> ; this song peaked at # 3 in 1988 . 
 " Hungry Eyes " , performed by Eric Carmen , composed by Franke Previte and John <unk> ; this song peaked at # 4 in 1988 . 
 " Yes " , performed by Merry Clayton , composed by Neal Cavanaugh , Terry Fryer and Tom Graf ; this song peaked # 45 in 1988 . 
 Additionally , the resurgence in popularity of the oldies contained in the movie led to a re @-@ release of The <unk> ' single " Do You Love Me " . " Do You Love Me " was featured in the movie but was omitted from the original soundtrack ; it was included on More Dirty Dancing . Upon being re @-@ released , " Do You Love Me " became a surprise hit all over again , this time peaking at # 11 ( it originally hit # 3 back in 1962 ) .

 As for the studio , despite the film 's huge monetary success , Vestron followed it up with a series of flops and ran out of money . Vestron 's parent company , Vestron Inc . , went bankrupt in 1990 , and was bought out in January 1991 by Live Entertainment for $ 26 million . The rights to Dirty Dancing now rest with Lions Gate Entertainment , which purchased Artisan Entertainment in 2003 . 
 Orbach , already known as a successful Broadway actor , continued in different genres . He was the voice of the candelabrum " Lumiere " in the Disney animated film Beauty and the Beast ( 1991 ) , before taking on his best known role , detective Lennie Briscoe in the TV crime drama Law & Order , which he played from 1992 until his death in 2004 . 
 Choreographer Ortega went on to choreograph and direct other major pictures such as Newsies ( 1992 ) and starting in 2006 , the High School Musical series . He also became a director of film and television , including several episodes of Gilmore Girls , in which Dirty Dancing 's Kelly Bishop had a starring role . 
 Lake Lure celebrated its Dirty Dancing legacy in the 1980s with the Dirty Dancing Revue featuring the A @-@ Lure Dancers , soul singer Maurice Williams ( whose song " Stay " was featured in the film ) , and Billy Scott and the Party Prophets . Today , Lake Lure hosts the annual Dirty Dancing Festival . 
 Kellerman 's Hotel is the Mountain Lake Hotel , and it now offers " Dirty Dancing Weekends " . 
 Various images and lines from the film have worked their way into popular culture . Johnny Castle 's line , " Nobody puts Baby in a corner " , has been used in song lyrics , as the title of the " Nobody Puts Baby in a Corner " episode of the TV series Veronica Mars , and as the title of a Fall Out Boy song . " Nobody puts Baby in a corner " was also quoted in Supernatural : when Dean says the line concerning his beloved Impala and his brother Sam retorts that the line is from a Swayze movie ; Dean responds : " Swayze always gets a pass " . The line was parodied in the webcomic Looking for Group where Richard , one of the primary characters , uttered a variation involving his own name , and in Family Guy , where the scene is parodied by Baby 's parents questioning Johnny due to her youth . The feminist art group Sisters of Jam put the text " Nobody puts Baby in a corner " ( in English ) in white neon light at Umeå Bus Square ( 2008 ) and at Karlstad University ( 2012 ) . 
 Family Guy also parodies the scene where Baby first sees Johnny dancing with the staff . In the TV series How I Met Your Mother , Barney Stinson attempts to pass off the Dirty Dancing story as the story of his own loss of virginity because he is ashamed of his actual story ; the original " Love is Strange " scene is shown with Barney replacing Johnny . 
 The French film Heartbreaker ( 2010 ) pays homage to the film , as a plot detail , with some clips from the film shown and a " recreation " by the two main characters of the " lift " scene . 
 In the first episode of the TV series New Girl , the female lead Jess watches the film repeatedly after her break up .

 = = Plot = = 
 Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace ( Andy Buckley ) has tasked Dwight Schrute ( Rainn Wilson ) with finding a part @-@ time replacement for Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) . Pam Halpert ( Jenna Fischer ) is concerned about this , as Jim 's replacement will be her new " deskmate " . Clark ( Clark Duke ) feels he is ready for the position , citing his key role in the sales in " The Whale " and " Suit Warehouse " , but Dwight wants someone who he can be sure won 't team up with Pam against him . To that end , he brings in a bizarre gallery of his relatives and close friends , including his cousin Mose ( Michael Schur ) , best friend Rolf , part @-@ time private investigator Trevor , former Corporate executive Troy <unk> , and his karate teacher ( " The Fight " ) Sensei Ira . To Dwight 's horror , though , none of his candidates are competent enough to even make it through the full job interview , much less be paper salesmen . Clark ends his interview without answering any of Dwight 's questions , simply pointing out that he has no choice but to hire him if he wants someone who can do the job . 
 Jim calls Wallace to pitch for the CEO to invest in Athlead . Dwight puts the conversation on speaker phone , allowing him to hear Wallace first tell Jim his salary is going to be cut to reflect his part @-@ time status , and then bluntly shoot down the idea of investing in Athlead . Dwight , though praising his friends ' outlandish delinquent behavior to the cameras , gradually comes to realize his professional integrity won 't allow him to hire any of them , and sadly notes that he outgrew all of his friends in just three hours . Afraid they will hate him if he doesn 't pick one of them , he asks Jim to pretend to take over the hiring decision and make the call to hire no one . Being willing to do anything to save Pam from being stuck with an unbearable deskmate , Jim agrees . However , when Jim announces the decision , Rolf immediately <unk> that Dwight is using Jim as a scapegoat . Dwight 's friends storm off to play paintball without him , later sending an e @-@ mail with a photo of their paintball outing and the message " Glad you 're not here " . Clark gets the salesman job . Pam is grateful to Jim for arranging this but says she still misses her " old deskmate " , i.e. Jim . Pam briefly lifts Dwight 's spirits by suggesting they " haze the new guy " , though she makes Dwight stop that plan when he nearly suffocates Clark with shrink wrap . It is also hinted that Brian , the boom mike operator for the documentary crew , has grown a crush on Pam .

 " Junior Salesman " was written by executive story editor Carrie Kemper , who is the younger sister of cast member Ellie Kemper , making it her fourth writing credit for the series , following the ninth @-@ season entry , " The Whale " . The episode was directed by series editor David Rogers , marking his eighth directing credit for the series , following the ninth season entry , " Andy 's Ancestry " . The episode features guest appearances from Matt L. Jones as Dwight 's cousin , Zeke . Jones had initially been cast for a proposed Office spin @-@ off centered on Dwight titled " The Farm " . A backdoor pilot was filmed , but upon review , the spin @-@ off was not picked up by NBC . The episode also features the first time appearance of Eric Wareheim as Gabor and Will McCormack as Wolf . In addition to new guest stars , the episode saw the return of several minor characters , including Lance Krall as Sensei Ira , Chris Gethard as Trevor , Noel Petok as Troy Underbridge , Beth Grant as Dwight 's babysitter , <unk> , and James Urbaniak as Rolf . 
 The press release for the episode included , " Erin tries to find her birth parents with Pete 's help " , although this plotline was completely absent from the episode . David Rogers , who is also an editor on the series , said that storyline was cut because " we had so much great comedy and needed the time for Dwight and his freaky friends and how Jim and the gang reacted " . Rogers also commented since they shoot in a documentary style , they can shoot faster than regular single @-@ camera comedies , meaning their first cut of the episodes can be 15 – 21 minutes longer than the 22 @-@ minute air length , and several scenes need to be cut .

 = Canadian Afghan detainee issue = 
 For a more detailed timeline of events , see Timeline of the Canadian Afghan detainee issue . 
 The Canadian Afghan detainee issue concerns whether or not the Government of Canada and / or the Canadian Forces ( CF ) had knowledge about alleged abusive treatment of detainees in Afghanistan . The alleged abuse occurred after Afghans were detained by Canadian Forces , and subsequently transferred to the Afghan National Army ( ANA ) or the Afghan National Directorate of Security ( NDS ) during the War in Afghanistan . The issue has sparked heated debate since Article 12 of the Third Geneva Convention ( of which Canada is a signatory ) states that " the <unk> Power [ Canada ] is responsible for the treatment given [ to prisoners of war ] " . If the allegations of torture are true it would mean Canada is guilty of war crimes . 
 The allegations were first sparked by University of Ottawa law professor Amir Attaran , who claimed that full versions of government documents proved Canada had willful knowledge that torture would occur before handing detainees to Afghan authorities . Subsequent to this , two official complaints have led to official investigations and hearings by the Military Police Complaints Commission ( MPCC ) . One of these unveiled parliamentary testimony by diplomat Richard Colvin , who claimed that many detainees were probably tortured , and it was a standard operating procedure for Afghan interrogators . The allegations have led to a showdown in the Canadian House of Commons , as opposition Members of Parliament ( MPs ) had called for the releasing of relevant documents in full and unredacted form , claiming parliamentary privilege to see them . The government maintained that they had a duty to protect Canadian soldiers and citizens as the documents contained sensitive information . 
 At the request of the Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons , a panel of former justices and selected MPs was tasked with sorting through the documents , and determining the need to release or withhold them . To date , only about 4 @,@ 000 out of the estimated 40 @,@ 000 documents have been released , A final report released in June 2012 found no wrongdoing by Canadian Forces members , but did issue recommendations related to improving military policing and MPCC access to information and witnesses . The Canadian public generally held views that there was knowledge of detainee abuse by military or government officials . The issue has also led to scrutiny on detainee treatment by other Canadian departments and the armed forces of other nations . 
 = = Background = = 
 Canada 's military involvement in Afghanistan began in 2002 with the International Security Assistance Force ( ISAF ) , a coalition of soldiers from 42 countries , which was tasked as a counterinsurgency effort in response to the September 11 attacks . ISAF had initially been established as a stabilization force by the United Nations Security Council on 20 December 2001 , to secure Kabul . The Canadian Liberal government at the time , under Prime Minister Jean Chrétien , chose to have the Canadian Forces ( CF ) hand over its prisoners to the United States , who led the fight against al @-@ Qaeda and other insurgents . After NATO took command of Afghanistan in 2003 , Abu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse at the hands of the United States armed forces in Iraq came to the attention of the public , and Canada soon faced pressure to hand their prisoners to someone else . Canada entered into an agreement with the Afghan government and started transferring detainees to Afghan security forces , which comprised the Afghan National Army ( ANA ) and the Afghan National Directorate of Security ( NDS ) . 
 On 18 December 2005 , then @-@ Chief of Defence Staff Rick Hillier signed an agreement between Canada 's Department of National Defence and the Government of Afghanistan . The agreement did not include any explicit right of access by Canada to Afghan detainees . Members of the opposition requested then @-@ Minister of National Defence Gordon O 'Connor to renegotiate the prisoner transfer agreement . This request was dismissed , with O 'Connor saying the International Committee of the Red Cross and the Red Crescent fulfilled the duty of ensuring fair treatment of detainees and Canada could be notified and take action in any cases of abuse . However , the Red Cross stated that their mandate was being misunderstood , and it was the responsibility of Canada . It maintained that it had no role in monitoring the Canada @-@ Afghanistan detainee @-@ transfer agreement , and that following long @-@ established operating procedure , the Red Cross would not reveal to any foreign government any abuses it might find in Afghan prisons . While maintaining that detainee monitoring was the Red Cross ' duty until March 2007 , O 'Connor apologized to the House of Commons for previously misleading them on the issue . In turn , a new agreement was reached in April 2007 that allowed Canadian officials to have access to Kandahar jails . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Initial allegations = = = 
 The first allegations of detainee abuse came in early February 2007 , when University of Ottawa law professor Amir Attaran produced documents he had received through an access @-@ to @-@ information request showing that three prisoners in the custody of Canadian military police were brought in by their Afghan interrogator for treatment of similar injuries to the head and upper body , all on the same day . Attaran argued this could be evidence of torture on the part of the interrogator and should be investigated . Attaran has maintained these allegations , stating in 2010 that the documents show torture of detainees was an actual tactic used to obtain information during interrogation . 
 In April 2007 , The Globe and Mail published interviews with 30 men who claimed they were " beaten , starved , frozen and choked after they were handed over to Afghanistan 's National Directorate of Security " by CF members . It also revealed that it had received a censored report by the Canadian government on human rights in Afghanistan through an access to information request , and it contained " negative references to acts such as torture , abuse , and extra judicial killings [ that ] were blacked out without an explanation . " This prompted intensive questioning in the House , to which O 'Connor claimed that a new agreement had been reached , saying " we have , in the last few days , entered into a local agreement in the Kandahar province to enter the detention facilities any time we want . " This would be reaffirmed by Prime Minister Stephen Harper , stating that there was " no evidence that access is blocked to the prisons " , and that Afghan authorities had agreed to " formalize that agreement so there is no potential misunderstanding . " Regardless , NATO Secretary General Jaap de Hoop Scheffer announced that the Afghan government was to launch an inquiry about the fate of detainees . In January 2008 , it was revealed that the government ceased the detainee transfers after an internal investigation revealed allegations of a detainee being abused on 5 November 2007 .

 Allegations regarding the treatment of Afghan detainees resurfaced in November 2009 via parliamentary testimony by Richard Colvin , the second highest @-@ ranked member of Canada ’ s diplomatic service in Afghanistan from 2006 to 2007 . Colvin claimed that many detainees were probably tortured , and it was a standard operating procedure for Afghan interrogators . This would be consistent with special reports by the United Nations Human Rights Commission and the US Department of State . Colvin also said the torture involved beatings , whipping with power cables , the use of electricity , knives , open flames and rape . The Canadian government dismissed opposition calls for a public inquiry the next day . " There has not been a single , solitary proven allegation of abuse involving a transferred Taliban prisoner by Canadian forces " , Defence Minister Peter MacKay said in the House of Commons , with his parliamentary secretary suggesting Colvin was not credible . 
 Regardless , Colvin would provide further testimony in a hearing at the MPCC . He stated that upon visiting Kandahar province 's main prison in May 2006 , he discovered the ICRC had a " serious problem " with trying to keep track of Afghan prisoners . Officials had approached Colvin with " forceful " concerns about the lack of information given to them by Canada , causing them to lose " many , if not most — and possibly all — of our detainees , " stated Colvin . He has also presented allegations that Canadian government and military officials knew about reports of abuse and human rights violations surrounding former governor of Kandahar Asadullah Khalid , saying Canadian officials heard credible sources claiming that Khalid ran a drug network , used drugs himself , used private detention facilities , and sexually abused young girls . Colvin is not the only civil servant to indicate there was a problem about Afghan detainees . Eileen <unk> , another Canadian diplomat in Afghanistan , also revealed in an interview with the CBC that she had warned the government in 2005 about torture problems . She said that the government , which was under the leadership of Paul Martin at the time , ignored her advice .

 On 8 December 2009 , General Walter Natynczyk testified before a parliamentary committee that one particular detainee that was abused on 14 June 2006 by Afghan police was never in CF custody . Canada 's chief commander stated that although CF members had questioned the man , he was taken into custody by Afghan police , and Canadian troops rescued him when the police started beating him with their shoes . However , the general corrected himself the following day upon receiving new information that the man had in fact been in Canadian custody . This would be the first piece of evidence that Afghan detainees in Canadian custody were subsequently abused by Afghan officials , contrary to government claims that there was no such evidence . It prompted opposition MPs to recall for a public inquiry into the matter , and for Peter MacKay to be fired . Canada 's top military commander subsequently ordered an inquiry to find out why he had not been informed about this incident . This inquiry revealed many Canadian soldiers were aware that Afghan security forces beat prisoners " in the street and elsewhere " on a regular basis . A separate report to General Natynczyk also concluded that the detainee beaten in June 2006 was not defined as a Canadian detainee , preventing it from being reported up the chain of command , and that the CF and Department of Defence should “ be tasked to examine the detainee reporting process ... to develop one consolidated process for the reporting on [ Canadian Forces ] detainees . ” 
 The United Nations ( UN ) has released at least two reports implicating torture in Afghanistan . A report from April 2010 stated the " use of harsh interrogation techniques and forced confession of guilt by the Afghan National Police and the National Directorate of Security was documented , including the use of electric shocks and beating " , against juvenile detainees suspected of being involved in insurgency . This became concerning after a briefing note to Peter MacKay stated that many juvenile detainees were arrested by the CF , and transferred to the NDS , as per CF policy for all detainees under the age of 18 . It also stated juvenile detainees were being kept in a Canadian transfer facility in Kandahar for " a significant period . " 
 Another report by the UN was released in October 2011 . Interviews with 379 detainees at 47 facilities over the period of a year found “ a compelling pattern and practice of systematic torture and ill @-@ treatment ” at multiple facilities operated by the ANP and NDS , after 46 % of the detainees it spoke with indicated it occurred . A written statement by the Afghan government denied the ' systematic ' nature of torture and claimed the report was exaggerated , although it admitted to deficiencies due to a lack of training and resources . The report also suggested that detainees handed over by the CF received different treatment , with one case citing a man who stated everyone was treated badly unless they were handled by Canadians . 
 = = = Investigations and inquiries = = = 
 While the first specific allegations of abuse surfaced more than three years ago , there has been no official public inquiry . MPs in the House of Commons voted 146 to 129 in favour of a motion to set one up , but the Prime Minister has refused to consider it , stating that " the government of Canada has taken all necessary actions in all instances where there is proof of abuse of Afghan prisoners . " Some critics and the Speaker of the House of Commons have also scolded both the government and opposition MPs for using the issue for political gain . Opposition MPs have stated that it should not be left to the military to investigate itself through the MPCC . 
 To date , there have been two main investigations conducted by the MPCC in relation to Afghan detainees . The first was launched on 9 February 2007 after a formal complaint by Amir Attaran regarding the treatment of three specific detainees arrested in Kandahar region in April 2006 . The findings from this investigation stated that CF members handled the detainees appropriately , and were given medical treatment . However , the MPCC also found that the CF failed to conduct an investigation into how one of the detainees became injured , contrary to normal direction . 
 The second investigation was launched on 26 February 2007 , following a joint complaint between Amnesty International Canada and the British Columbia Civil Liberties Association , alleging CF military police transferred detainees while there was enough evidence to suggest they would be tortured on at least 18 occasions . The investigation was moved to a public hearing process on 12 March 2008 , mainly due to " delays and difficulties in obtaining relevant documents and information from government authorities . " This triggered legal challenges from the federal government over the MPCC 's jurisdiction to investigate such complaints , resulting in a ruling that the MPCC had no jurisdiction over " transfer complaints " , but it did over " failure to investigate " complaints . During substantial testimony and hearings throughout 2010 , the government engaged the MPCC another three times for judicial review of the MPCC findings , including the testimony of Richard Colvin . A judge dismissed these challenges in September 2011 . 
 The MPCC released its report on June 27 , 2012 . No wrongdoing was found against specific Canadian Forces members , but the report " identified serious problems regarding reporting , accountability and information sharing . " Four recommendations were made in the report to specifically improve the work of Canadian Forces Military Police that are deployed on missions , as well as improving document disclosure and witness access during MPCC hearings .

 Opposition MPs in the House of Commons began calling for all documents the government possessed regarding the detainee issue to be made public since Richard Colvin ’ s testimony in November 2009 . Minister of Foreign Affairs Lawrence Cannon assured the House of Commons that the documents would be handed over to a special committee in charge of looking into the issue . " There 's a mandatory obligation on public officials to ensure that when information is released that it is in compliance with the Canada Evidence Act [ to avoid security risks ] , " according to Minister of Defence Peter MacKay . However , opposition MPs and other critics stated that this was an absurd argument , as Parliament has the constitutional right to have access to the documents uncensored . On 10 December 2009 , the House of Commons passed a motion requiring the release of unredacted documents concerning the Afghan detainees to the committee hearing the issue . However , the government refused to abide by the motion . Critics repeated that the government was violating the Constitution of Canada and will be in contempt of Parliament if it continued to refuse to release uncensored documents regarding the Afghan detainee issue . 
 On 30 December 2009 , Parliament was put on hold , or ' prorogued ' at the request of the Prime Minister . According to his spokesman , he sought this prorogation to consult with Canadians about the economy . The move caused cries from opposition MPs who labelled it as an attempt to " muzzle parliamentarians amid controversy over the Afghan detainees affair . " <unk> prevented the parliamentary committee from continuing to probe the issue . Although informal committee meetings continued , they had no power to compel testimony or grant immunity , and Conservative MPs would not be represented . 
 = = = Parliament resumes and 2010 release = = = 
 Justice Minister Rob Nicholson announced to the House of Commons on 5 March 2010 that former Supreme Court of Canada judge Frank Iacobucci was appointed to advise Nicholson if any " injurious " effects would result from making the Afghan detainee documents public . However , University of Ottawa law professor Amir Attaran pointed out that Iacobucci was not a sitting judge and therefore had no power except to give lawyer advice to Nicholson . The opposition expressed deep disappointment with the decision , saying that they did not doubt the competence of the former justice , but believed that it was nothing more than another way to delay the issue . While parliamentarians were not given the Terms of Reference posed to Iacobucci immediately , they were released on 13 March 2010 . 
 The government finally released thousands of documents to MPs at the end of March 2010 . The documents immediately drew fierce criticism by the opposition , because they were still heavily redacted , and the " totally incoherent and totally disorderly " fashion of handing them out in a single copy and only in English ( instead of both of Canada 's official languages ) . The government maintained that redactions are required to protect Canada , with Justice Minister Rob Nicholson stating they were done by " non @-@ partisan public servants whose only interest is the protection of national security . " 
 = = = Speaker 's question and ruling = = = 
 On 18 March , the three opposition parties united in a bid to force the government to let them look at uncensored documents on the Afghan detainees affair or face parliamentary contempt proceedings . Specifically , they called on the Speaker of the Canadian House of Commons , Peter Milliken to rule that the government violated collective parliamentary privilege # 5 in refusing to hand over uncensored documents on the transfer of Afghan detainees . MPs have claimed that the request from Parliament was based on " 340 years of bedrock constitutional history " , and that there are systems in place to decide what is and is not appropriate to release to the public . Referring to those " systems , " Reg Whitaker noted that members of the " Military Police Complaints Commission , whose investigation of the Afghan detainee issue actually led to the calling of the parliamentary inquiry ... are [ already ] fully security cleared [ to see the unredacted documents ] . " 
 The Speaker first asked for comments from government and opposition MPs on the matter , including Peter MacKay , Rob Nicholson , Derek Lee , Jack Harris , Tom <unk> , and Jim Abbott . After considering the matter for two weeks , the Speaker ruled on 27 April 2010 that Parliament had a right to ask for uncensored documents . He asked that all House leaders , ministers and MPs to come to a collective solution " without compromising the security and confidentiality contained . " The Speaker gave the House until 11 May 2010 to find a common ground . While MPs within the negotiations had to ask The Speaker for an extension of the deadline , it was granted until 14 May , and a deal was reached that morning . A Memorandum of Understanding on the particulars was not established until 16 June , when it was actually tabled in the House of Commons . It was still not agreed to by all political parties : The New Democratic Party refused to endorse the deal . 
 = = = Panel work and 2011 release = = = 
 A panel of MPs began the task of going through over 40 @,@ 000 documents related to Afghan detainees on 10 July 2010 . The MPs , consisting of one member and one alternate from the Liberal , Conservative and Bloc parties , determines what is relevant to the allegations of abuse . An independent panel of jurists determines how documents will be released publicly , in some cases censoring documents that may threaten national security , international relations , or soldiers in Afghanistan . This panel consists of Frank Iacobucci , fellow former Supreme Court justice Claire L <unk> @-@ Dubé and former B.C. Supreme Court judge Donald Brenner . Any documents that the government claims to contain legal advice may force the panel to determine whether to allow the MPs to see them . 
 Approximately 4 @,@ 000 documents were released by the government on 22 June 2011 , almost a year after the panel began its work . Foreign Affairs Minister John Baird stated that the process had come to an end , " and accusations of improper conduct are unfounded . " However , there are an estimated 36 @,@ 000 pages still remaining that have not been released in a less @-@ redacted form . Based on the documents that were released , MP Stéphane Dion implied that they were cause for concern , and " The likelihood is very high " that a detainee was abused while in the custody of Afghan authorities . " I don 't think Canadians will accept that it 's over , " he added .

 In March 2010 , the Canadian Press reported that documents filed with the MPCC showed that the Canadian Security Intelligence Service ( CSIS ) had started playing a role in the interrogation of Afghans captured by the CF . Sources say the military 's decision to hand captives over to the NDS was sometimes based on the recommendations of CSIS interrogators , but Canadian military officials always delivered the final decision . This prompted CSIS to undertake a review of its dealings with Afghan detainees “ to ensure that the Service can ... account for its engagement during this period . " Briefing notes to CSIS director Dick Fadden state that the service interrogated up to 50 prisoners ( between 2002 through late 2007 according to an assistant director with the service ) , but insists that they were treated properly . The notes also state " CSIS officers have been serving alongside the Canadian Forces " while armed , and affirms that agents had no role in determining whether prisoners should be transferred to Afghan authorities . 
 It is believed that initial investigations into the treatment of Afghan detainees sparked investigations into Canada 's elite military unit , Joint Task Force 2 ( JTF2 ) . The first investigation , named Sand Trap , examined allegations that a JTF2 member was involved in the 2006 shooting death of an Afghan who was surrendering . No charges were laid at the conclusion of the investigation . However , a larger investigation called Sand Trap II began hearing from witnesses in May 2009 regarding allegations of JTF2 members witnessing United States armed forces killing an unarmed man . This investigation is still being conducted by the Canadian Forces National Investigation Service , and it has led to calls for civilian oversight of JTF2 .

 There are also allegations that the NDS tortured detainees handed over to them by British soldiers in Afghanistan . Allegations were also made that British Armed Forces have received evidence of this torture , and NATO " has buried its head in the sand while torture has continued , and it 's known about it . " The British High Court of Justice ruled on 25 June 2010 that there was " a possibility of torture and serious mistreatment ” of prisoners . It is now illegal for British troops to hand over detainees to the NDS in Kabul , however The High Court still approved of transfers in Kandahar and Helmand provinces . This was on the condition that government and military officials improved its systems for monitoring detainees , in order to avoid " a real risk of torture or serious mistreatment . ” 
 On 6 September 2011 , it was revealed that NATO had suspended transfers of detainees to several Afghan prisons . The move was prompted by a United Nations report , published a few days later , which described “ a compelling pattern and practice of systematic torture and ill @-@ treatment ” at a number of facilities run by the NDS and Afghan police . NATO stated it would undertake verification on the claims , and be " prudent " in halting transfers until that time .

 An <unk> poll conducted in December 2009 revealed that 83 % of the respondents believed the government knew Afghan detainees were tortured . This was a consistent result across all age groups , genders and geographic locations . It also concluded that 41 % of respondents were dissatisfied with the governments transparency on the issue , and only 24 % were satisfied . The remaining 35 % were still undecided or had no opinion . As time progressed , 61 % of Canadians still believed Afghan detainees were tortured in May 2010 , according to an Ipsos @-@ Reid poll . This poll also found that 52 % of respondents believed that Stephen Harper and Canadian soldiers knew torture was occurring , and 75 % believed senior military officials would have known about the problem . A poll done by Angus Reid during 5 January and 6 , found that 38 per cent of Canadians believed that Harper used the 30 December 2009 prorogation to curtail the Canadian Afghan detainee issue .

 Kolkata / <unk> / ( Bengali : <unk> ) formerly Calcutta / <unk> / ( Bengali : <unk> ্ <unk> ) is the capital of the Indian state of West Bengal . Located on the east bank of the Hooghly River , it is the principal commercial , cultural , and educational centre of East India , while the Port of Kolkata is India 's oldest operating port and its sole major riverine port . In 2011 , the city had population of 4 @.@ 5 million , while the population of the city and its suburbs was 14 @.@ 1 million , making it the third @-@ most populous metropolitan area in India . In 2008 its gross domestic product ( adjusted for purchasing power parity ) was estimated to be US $ 104 billion , which was the third highest among Indian cities , behind Mumbai and Delhi . As a growing city in a developing country , Kolkata has pollution , traffic congestion , poverty , overcrowding , and other problems . 
 In the late 17th century , the three villages that predated Calcutta were ruled by the Nawab of Bengal under Mughal suzerainty . After the Nawab granted the East India Company a trading licence in 1690 , the area was developed by the Company into an increasingly fortified trading post . Nawab Siraj ud @-@ Daulah occupied Calcutta in 1756 , and the East India Company retook it the following year . In 1793 the East India company was strong enough to abolish Nizamat ( local rule ) , and assumed full sovereignty of the region . Under the company rule , and later under the British Raj , Calcutta served as the capital of British @-@ held territories in India until 1911 , when its perceived geographical disadvantages , combined with growing nationalism in Bengal , led to a shift of the capital to New Delhi . Calcutta was the centre for the Indian independence movement ; it remains a hotbed of contemporary state politics . Following Indian independence in 1947 , Kolkata , which was once the centre of modern Indian education , science , culture , and politics , suffered several decades of economic stagnation . 
 As a nucleus of the 19th- and early 20th @-@ century Bengal Renaissance and a religiously and ethnically diverse centre of culture in Bengal and India , Kolkata has local traditions in drama , art , film , theatre , and literature . Many people from Kolkata — among them several Nobel laureates — have contributed to the arts , the sciences , and other areas . Kolkata culture features idiosyncrasies that include distinctively close @-@ knit neighbourhoods ( paras ) and freestyle intellectual exchanges ( <unk> ) . West Bengal 's share of the Bengali film industry is based in the city , which also hosts venerable cultural institutions of national importance , such as the Academy of Fine Arts , the Victoria Memorial , the Asiatic Society , the Indian Museum and the National Library of India . Among professional scientific institutions , Kolkata hosts the Agri Horticultural Society of India , the Geological Survey of India , the Botanical Survey of India , the Calcutta Mathematical Society , the Indian Science Congress Association , the Zoological Survey of India , the Institution of Engineers , the Anthropological Survey of India and the Indian Public Health Association . Though home to major cricketing venues and franchises , Kolkata differs from other Indian cities by giving importance to association football and other sports . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 The word Kolkata derives from the Bengali term <unk> ( Bengali : কলিকাতা ) [ ˈkɔlikat ̪ a ] , the name of one of three villages that predated the arrival of the British , in the area where the city eventually was to be established ; the other two villages were Sutanuti and <unk> . 
 There are several explanations about the etymology of this name : 
 The term <unk> is thought to be a variation of <unk> [ <unk> ̪ <unk> ] ( Bengali : <unk> ্ <unk> ্ <unk> ) , meaning " Field of [ the goddess ] Kali " . Similarly , it can be a variation of ' <unk> ' ( Sanskrit : <unk> ् <unk> ् र , lit. area of Goddess Kali " ) . 
 Alternatively , the name may have been derived from the Bengali term <unk> ( Bengali : <unk> ) , or " flat area " . 
 The name may have its origin in the words <unk> [ <unk> ] ( Bengali : <unk> ) meaning " canal " , followed by <unk> [ <unk> ] ( Bengali : <unk> ) , which may mean " dug " . 
 According to another theory , the area specialised in the production of quicklime or <unk> chun [ <unk> ] ( Bengali : <unk> <unk> ) and coir or kata [ <unk> ̪ a ] ( Bengali : <unk> ) ; hence , it was called <unk> [ ˈkɔlikat ̪ a ] ( Bengali : কলিকাতা ) . 
 Although the city 's name has always been pronounced Kolkata [ <unk> ̪ a ] ( Bengali : <unk> ) or <unk> [ ˈkɔlikat ̪ a ] ( Bengali : কলিকাতা ) in Bengali , the anglicised form Calcutta was the official name until 2001 , when it was changed to Kolkata in order to match Bengali pronunciation . 
 = = History = = 
 The discovery and archaeological study of <unk> , 35 kilometres ( 22 mi ) north of Kolkata , provide evidence that the region in which the city stands has been inhabited for over two millennia . Kolkata 's recorded history began in 1690 with the arrival of the English East India Company , which was consolidating its trade business in Bengal . Job Charnock , an administrator who worked for the Company , was formerly credited as the founder of the city ; In response to a public petition , the Calcutta High Court ruled in 2003 that the city does not have a founder . The area occupied by the present @-@ day city encompassed three villages : <unk> , <unk> , and Sutanuti . <unk> was a fishing village ; Sutanuti was a riverside weavers ' village . They were part of an estate belonging to the Mughal emperor ; the <unk> ( a land grant bestowed by a king on his noblemen ) taxation rights to the villages were held by the <unk> Roy Choudhury family of landowners , or zamindars . These rights were transferred to the East India Company in 1698 . 
 In 1712 , the British completed the construction of Fort William , located on the east bank of the Hooghly River to protect their trading factory . Facing frequent skirmishes with French forces , the British began to upgrade their fortifications in 1756 . The Nawab of Bengal , Siraj ud @-@ Daulah , condemned the militarisation and tax evasion by the company . His warning went unheeded , and the Nawab attacked ; he captured Fort William which led to the killings of several East India company officials in the Black Hole of Calcutta . A force of Company soldiers ( sepoys ) and British troops led by Robert Clive recaptured the city the following year . Per the 1765 Treaty of Allahabad following the battle of Buxar , East India company was appointed imperial tax collector of the Mughal emperor in the province of Bengal , Bihar and Orissa , while Mughal @-@ appointed Nawabs continued to rule the province . Declared a presidency city , Calcutta became the headquarters of the East India Company by 1772 . In 1793 , ruling power of the Nawabs were abolished and East India company took complete control of the city and the province . In the early 19th century , the marshes surrounding the city were drained ; the government area was laid out along the banks of the Hooghly River . Richard Wellesley , Governor @-@ General of the Presidency of Fort William between 1797 and 1805 , was largely responsible for the development of the city and its public architecture . Throughout the late 18th and 19th century , the city was a centre of the East India Company 's opium trade . 
 By the 1850s , Calcutta had two areas : White Town , which was primarily British and centred on Chowringhee and Dalhousie Square ; and Black Town , mainly Indian and centred on North Calcutta . The city underwent rapid industrial growth starting in the early 1850s , especially in the textile and jute industries ; this encouraged British companies to massively invest in infrastructure projects , which included telegraph connections and Howrah railway station . The coalescence of British and Indian culture resulted in the emergence of a new <unk> class of urbane Indians , whose members were often bureaucrats , professionals , newspaper readers , and <unk> ; they usually belonged to upper @-@ caste Hindu communities . In the 19th century , the Bengal Renaissance brought about an increased sociocultural sophistication among city denizens . In 1883 , Calcutta was host to the first national conference of the Indian National Association , the first avowed nationalist organisation in India . 
 The British moved the capital to New Delhi in 1911 . Calcutta continued to be a centre for revolutionary organisations associated with the Indian independence movement . The city and its port were bombed several times by the Japanese between 1942 and 1944 , during World War II . Coinciding with the war , millions starved to death during the Bengal famine of 1943 due to a combination of military , administrative , and natural factors . Demands for the creation of a Muslim state led in 1946 to an episode of communal violence that killed over 4 @,@ 000 . The partition of India led to further clashes and a demographic shift — many Muslims left for East Pakistan ( present day Bangladesh ) , while hundreds of thousands of Hindus fled into the city . 
 During the 1960s and 1970s , severe power shortages , strikes , and a violent Marxist – Maoist movement by groups known as the <unk> damaged much of the city 's infrastructure , resulting in economic stagnation . The Bangladesh Liberation War of 1971 led to a massive influx of thousands of refugees , many of them penniless , that strained Kolkata 's infrastructure . During the mid @-@ 1980s , Mumbai ( then called Bombay ) overtook Kolkata as India 's most populous city . In 1985 , prime minister Rajiv Gandhi dubbed Kolkata a " dying city " in light of its socio @-@ political woes . In the period 1977 – 2011 , West Bengal was governed from Kolkata by the Left Front , which was dominated by the Communist Party of India ( CPM ) . It was the world 's longest @-@ serving democratically elected communist government , during which Kolkata was a key base for Indian communism . In the West Bengal Legislative Assembly election , 2011 , Left Front was defeated by the Trinamool Congress . The city 's economic recovery gathered momentum after the 1990s , when India began to institute pro @-@ market reforms . Since 2000 , the information technology ( IT ) services sector has revitalised Kolkata 's stagnant economy . The city is also experiencing marked growth in its manufacturing base . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Spread roughly north – south along the east bank of the Hooghly River , Kolkata sits within the lower Ganges Delta of eastern India ; the city 's elevation is 1 @.@ 5 – 9 m ( 5 – 30 ft ) . Much of the city was originally a wetland that was reclaimed over the decades to accommodate a burgeoning population . The remaining undeveloped areas , known as the East Kolkata Wetlands , were designated a " wetland of international importance " by the Ramsar Convention ( 1975 ) . As with most of the Indo @-@ Gangetic Plain , the soil and water are predominantly alluvial in origin . Kolkata is located over the " Bengal basin " , a <unk> tertiary basin . Bengal basin comprises three structural units : shelf or platform in the west ; central hinge or shelf / slope break ; and deep <unk> part in the east and southeast . Kolkata is located atop the western part of the hinge zone which is about 25 km ( 16 mi ) wide at a depth of about 45 @,@ 000 m ( 148 @,@ 000 ft ) below the surface . The shelf and hinge zones have many faults , among them some are active . Total thickness of sediment below Kolkata is nearly 7 @,@ 500 m ( 24 @,@ 600 ft ) above the crystalline basement ; of these the top 350 – 450 m ( 1 @,@ 150 – 1 @,@ 480 ft ) is quaternary , followed by 4 @,@ 500 – 5 @,@ 500 m ( 14 @,@ 760 – 18 @,@ 040 ft ) of tertiary sediments , 500 – 700 m ( 1 @,@ 640 – 2 @,@ 300 ft ) trap wash of cretaceous trap and 600 – 800 m ( 1 @,@ 970 – 2 @,@ 620 ft ) <unk> @-@ carboniferous Gondwana rocks . The quaternary sediments consist of clay , silt , and several grades of sand and gravel . These sediments are sandwiched between two clay beds : the lower one at a depth of 250 – 650 m ( 820 – 2 @,@ 130 ft ) ; the upper one 10 – 40 m ( 30 – 130 ft ) in thickness . According to the Bureau of Indian Standards , on a scale ranging from I to V in order of increasing susceptibility to earthquakes , the city lies inside seismic zone III .

 The Kolkata metropolitan area is spread over 1 @,@ 886 @.@ 67 km2 ( 728 @.@ 45 sq mi ) and comprises 3 municipal corporations ( including Kolkata Municipal Corporation ) , 39 local municipalities and 24 panchayat samitis , as of 2011 . The urban agglomeration encompassed 72 cities and 527 towns and villages , as of 2006 . Suburban areas in the Kolkata metropolitan area incorporate parts of the following districts : North 24 Parganas , South 24 Parganas , Howrah , Hooghly , and Nadia . Kolkata , which is under the jurisdiction of the Kolkata Municipal Corporation ( KMC ) , has an area of 185 km2 ( 71 sq mi ) . The east – west dimension of the city is comparatively narrow , stretching from the Hooghly River in the west to roughly the Eastern Metropolitan Bypass in the east — a span of 9 – 10 km ( 5 @.@ 6 – 6 @.@ 2 mi ) . The north – south distance is greater , and its axis is used to section the city into North , Central , and South Kolkata . 
 North Kolkata is the oldest part of the city . Characterised by 19th @-@ century architecture , dilapidated buildings , overpopulated slums , crowded bazaars and narrow alleyways , it includes areas such as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Kumortuli , <unk> , <unk> , Chitpur , <unk> , Cossipore , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and Dum Dum .

 Central Kolkata hosts the central business district . It contains B. B. D. Bagh , formerly known as Dalhousie Square , and the Esplanade on its east ; Strand Road is on its west . The West Bengal Secretariat , General Post Office , Reserve Bank of India , High Court , <unk> Police Headquarters , and several other government and private offices are located there . Another business hub is the area south of Park Street , which comprises thoroughfares such as Jawaharlal Nehru Road , <unk> Street , Wood Street , Loudon Street , Shakespeare <unk> , and A. J. C. Bose Road . The Maidan is a large open field in the heart of the city that has been called the " lungs of Kolkata " and accommodates sporting events and public meetings . The Victoria Memorial and Kolkata Race Course are located at the southern end of the Maidan .

Severe air pollution in the city has caused a rise in pollution @-@ related respiratory ailments , such as lung cancer . 
 = = Economy = = 
 Kolkata is the main commercial and financial hub of East and North @-@ East India and home to the Calcutta Stock Exchange . It is a major commercial and military port , and is the only city in eastern India to have an international airport . Once India 's leading city , Kolkata experienced a steady economic decline in the decades following India 's independence due to steep population increases and a rise in militant trade @-@ unionism , which included frequent strikes that were backed by left @-@ wing parties . From the 1960s to the late 1990s , several factories were closed and businesses relocated . The lack of capital and resources added to the depressed state of the city 's economy and gave rise to an unwelcome sobriquet : the " dying city " . The city 's fortunes improved after the Indian economy was liberalised in the 1990s and changes in economic policy were enacted by the West Bengal state government . 
 Flexible production has been the norm in Kolkata , which has an informal sector that employs more than 40 % of the labour force . One unorganised group , roadside hawkers , generated business worth ₹ 8 @,@ 772 crore ( US $ 2 billion ) in 2005 . As of 2001 , around 0 @.@ 81 % of the city 's workforce was employed in the primary sector ( agriculture , forestry , mining , etc . ) ; 15 @.@ 49 % worked in the secondary sector ( industrial and manufacturing ) ; and 83 @.@ 69 % worked in the tertiary sector ( service industries ) . As of 2003 , the majority of households in slums were engaged in occupations belonging to the informal sector ; 36 @.@ 5 % were involved in servicing the urban middle class ( as maids , drivers , etc . ) , and 22 @.@ 2 % were casual labourers . About 34 % of the available labour force in Kolkata slums were unemployed . According to one estimate , almost a quarter of the population live on less than 27 rupees ( equivalent to 45 US cents ) per day . As in many other Indian cities , information technology became a high @-@ growth sector in Kolkata starting in the late 1990s ; the city 's IT sector grew at 70 % per annum — a rate that was twice the national average . The 2000s saw a surge of investments in the real estate , infrastructure , retail , and hospitality sectors ; several large shopping malls and hotels were launched . As of 2010 , Kolkata , with an estimated gross domestic product ( GDP ) by purchasing power parity of 150 billion dollars , ranked third among South Asian cities , after Mumbai and Delhi . Kolkata 's GDP in 2014 was Rs 1 @.@ 84 trillion , according to a collaborative assessment by multiple universities and climate agencies . 
 Kolkata is home to many industrial units operated by large <unk> and private @-@ sector corporations ; major sectors include steel , heavy engineering , mining , minerals , cement , pharmaceuticals , food processing , agriculture , electronics , textiles , and jute . ITC Limited , Coal India Limited , National Insurance Company , Exide Industries and Britannia Industries rank among the companies headquartered in the city . The Tea Board of India and the Ordnance Factories Board of the Ministry of Defence are also headquartered in the city . Kolkata hosts the headquarters of three major public @-@ sector banks : Allahabad Bank , <unk> Bank , and the United Bank of India . Adoption of the " Look East " policy by the Indian government ; opening of Sikkim 's Nathu La mountain pass , which is located on the border between India and China , to bi @-@ directional international trade ; and the interest shown by South @-@ East Asian countries in expanding into Indian markets are factors that could benefit Kolkata .

This represents a decline of 1 @.@ 88 % during the decade 2001 – 11 . The sex ratio is 899 females per 1000 males — lower than the national average . The ratio is depressed by the influx of working males from surrounding rural areas , from the rest of West Bengal , and from neighbouring states , mainly Bihar , Uttar Pradesh , and Orissa ; these men commonly leave their families behind .

The unauthorised slums ( devoid of basic services provided by the municipality ) are occupied by squatters who started living on encroached lands — mainly along canals , railway lines and roads . According to the 2005 National Family Health Survey , around 14 % of the households in Kolkata were poor , while 33 % lived in slums , indicating a substantial proportion of households in slum areas were better off economically than the bottom quarter of urban households in terms of wealth status .

 = Q 'umarkaj = 
 Q 'umarkaj , ( K 'iche ' : [ <unk> ] ) ( sometimes rendered as <unk> , <unk> , <unk> or <unk> ) is an archaeological site in the southwest of the El Quiché department of Guatemala . Q 'umarkaj is also known as Utatlán , the Nahuatl translation of the city 's name . The name comes from K 'iche ' Q <unk> " Place of old reeds " . 
 Q 'umarkaj was one of the most powerful Maya cities when the Spanish arrived in the region in the early 16th century . It was the capital of the K 'iche ' Maya in the Late Postclassic Period . At the time of the Spanish Conquest , Q 'umarkaj was a relatively new capital , with the capital of the K 'iche ' kingdom having originally been situated at Jakawitz ( identified with the archaeological site <unk> ) and then at Pismachi ' . Q 'umarkaj was founded during the reign of king Q 'uq 'umatz ( " Feathered Serpent " in K 'iche ' ) in the early 15th century , immediately to the north of Pismachi ' . In 1470 the city was seriously weakened by a rebellion among the nobility that resulted in the loss of key allies of the K 'iche ' . 
 <unk> and <unk> , Q 'umarkaj is the best known of the Late Postclassic highland Maya capitals . The earliest reference to the site in Spanish occurs in Hernán Cortés ' letters from Mexico . Although the site has been investigated , little reconstruction work has taken place . The surviving architecture , which includes a Mesoamerican ballcourt , temples and palaces , has been badly damaged by the looting of stone to build the nearby town of Santa Cruz del Quiché . 
 The major structures of Q 'umarkaj were laid out around a plaza . They included the temple of Tohil , a jaguar god who was patron of the city , the temple of Awilix , the patron goddess of one of the noble houses , the temple of Jakawitz , a mountain deity who was also a noble patron and the temple of Q 'uq 'umatz , the Feathered Serpent , the patron of the royal house . The main ballcourt was placed between the palaces of two of the principal noble houses . Palaces , or nimja , were spread throughout the city . There was also a platform that was used for gladiatorial sacrifice . 
 The area of Greater Q 'umarkaj was divided into four major political division , one for each of the most important ruling lineages , and also encompassed a number of smaller satellites sites , including Chisalin , Pismachi ' , Atalaya and Pakaman . The site core is open to the public and includes basic infrastructure , including a small site museum . 
 = = Etymology = = 
 Q 'umarkaj comes from the K 'iche ' Q <unk> 'aj . While often translated as " place of old reeds " or " place of rotted cane " , the name Q <unk> <unk> 'aaj translates more precisely as " rotted reed houses " ( q <unk> 'r 
 = " rotten " ; ka 'aaj = 
 " house or shack built of cane and reeds " ) . It was translated as Tecpan Utatlan by the Nahuatl @-@ speaking Tlaxcalan allies of the Spanish conquistadors , with Tecpan being added to distinguish the city as being a seat of rule , equivalent to the <unk> used in Mesoamerica in earlier times . 
 = = Location = = 
 The ruins of the city are 2 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 6 mi ) to the west of the modern city of Santa Cruz del Quiché . Q 'umarkaj completely occupies 120 @,@ 000 square metres ( 1 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 sq ft ) of an easily defended plateau surrounded by ravines over 100 metres ( 330 ft ) deep . The ravines are part of a drainage system feeding the Negro River , which flows into the <unk> River and eventually into the Usumacinta River and the Gulf of Mexico . A natural causeway to the southeast of the site links the plateau with a wide plain to the east . 
 Q 'umarkaj is the largest in a group of five major sites tightly clustered in an area of 4 square kilometres ( 1 @.@ 5 sq mi ) , with the area between the sites showing signs of also having been heavily occupied . Atalaya and Pakaman lie to the east , Pismachi ' lies to the south and Chisalin is to the north . 
 = = Inhabitants = = 
 In the Late Postclassic , the greater Q 'umarkaj area is estimated to have had a population of around 15 @,@ 000 . The inhabitants of Q 'umarkaj were divided socially between the nobility and their vassals . The nobles were known as the ajaw , while the vassals were known as the al k <unk> . The nobility were the patrilineal descendents of the founding warlords who appear to have entered as conquerors from the Gulf coast around AD 1200 and who eventually lost their original language and adopted that of their subjects . The nobles were regarded as sacred and bore royal imagery . Their vassals served as foot @-@ soldiers and were subject to the laws laid out by the nobility , although they could receive military titles as a result of their battlefield prowess . The social divisions were deep seated and were equivalent to strictly observed castes . The merchants were a privileged class , although they had to make tributary payments to the nobility . In addition to these classes , the population included rural labourers and artisans . Slaves were also held and included both sentenced criminals and prisoners of war . 
 There were twenty @-@ four important lineages , or nimja , in Q 'umarkaj , closely linked to the palaces in which the nobility attended to their duties ; <unk> means " big house " in K 'iche ' , after the palace complexes that the lineages occupied . Their duties included marriage negotiations and associated feasting and ceremonial lecturing . These lineages were strongly patrilineal and were grouped into four larger , more powerful nimja that chose the rulers of the city . At the time of the Conquest , the four ruling nimja were the Kaweq , the Nijaib , the Saqik and the Ajaw K 'iche ' . The Kaweq and the Nijaib included nine principal lineages each , the Ajaw K 'iche ' included four and the Saqik had two . As well as choosing the king and king elect , the ruling Kaweq dynasty also had a lineage that produced the powerful priests of Q 'uq 'umatz , who may have served as stewards of the city . 
 The K 'iche ' kingdom was ruled by a king , a king @-@ elect and two captains , a four @-@ way joint rule embodied in four leaders , one from each of the four most important lineages in the city of Q 'umarkaj . This form of rule was also known among the Maya of Yucatan . The ruling lineage was the Kaweq ( " Rain " ) dynasty , that chose both the king and the king @-@ elect . The king was known as the ajpop , " He of the Mat " . The king @-@ elect bore the title of ajpop k 'amha and assisted the king until he became king himself . The Nijaib and the Saqik noble houses chose the q 'alel ( supreme judge ) and the Ajaw K 'iche ' chose the <unk> <unk> ( speaker ) . 
 = = History = = 
 Ceramic remains from the site include pieces that date as far back as the Preclassic Period but the majority of finds date to the Late Postclassic and the height of the K 'iche ' kingdom . 
 = = = Founding and expansion = = = 
 The site was founded by king Q 'uq 'umatz around 1400 for its defensive position , however there is some disagreement as to whether he is a historical or a mythological figure . Q 'uq 'umatz is K 'iche for feathered serpent , and feathered serpent is used as a title in other parts of Mesoamerica . It is probable that Q 'uq 'umatz was really the title of another ajpop mentioned in the sources , Kotuja ' , and was actually the same individual . In the Título de los <unk> de Totonicapán , an early Colonial era K 'iche ' document , he is listed as Q 'uq 'umatz Kotuja ' . In the same title , his father is listed as Kotuja ' Q 'uq 'umatz , and there is confusion in the K 'iche ' documents as to whether they were one and the same , or father and son with very similar names . 
 K <unk> Q 'uq 'umatz married <unk> , daughter of the king of the Tz 'utujils of <unk> , a <unk> settlement near modern @-@ day San Lucas <unk> , on the shores of Lake Atitlán . Great magical powers were attributed to Q 'uq 'umatz and he was said to be able to transform himself into a snake , an eagle , a jaguar and blood . Q 'uq 'umatz had several children , one of whom ( K 'iq 'ab ) became king after him . Q 'uq 'umatz was killed in battle against the K 'oja Maya . 
 Q 'uq 'umatz greatly expanded the K 'iche ' kingdom , first from Pismachi ' and later from Q 'umarkaj . At this time , the K 'iche 's were closely allied with the Kaqchikels . Q 'uq 'umatz sent his daughter to marry the lord of the K 'oja , a Maya people based in the <unk> mountains , somewhere between Sacapulas and Huehuetenango . Instead of marrying her and submitting to the K 'iche ' -Kaqchikel alliance , Tekum Sik <unk> , the K 'oja king , killed the offered bride . This act initiated a war between the K 'iche ' -Kaqchikel of Q 'umarkaj and the K 'oja . Q 'uq 'umatz died in the resulting battle against the K 'oja . 
 With the death of his father in battle against the K 'oja , his son and heir K 'iq 'ab swore vengeance , and two years later he led the K 'iche ' -Kaqchikel alliance against his enemies , together with the <unk> K 'amha ( king @-@ elect ) . The K 'iche ' <unk> army entered K 'oja at first light , killed Tekum Sik <unk> and captured his son . K 'iq 'ab recovered the bones of his father and returned to Q 'umarkaj with many prisoners and all the jade and metal that the K 'oja possessed , after conquering various settlements in the Sacapulas area , and the Mam people near Zaculeu . 
 K 'iq 'ab was said to have had magical powers like his father . K 'iq 'ab was a particularly warlike king and during his reign he greatly expanded the kingdom to include Rabinal , Cobán and Quetzaltenango , and extended as far west as the <unk> River , near the modern border between the Chiapas coast of Mexico and Guatemalan Pacific coast . With Kaqchikel help , the eastern frontier of the kingdom was pushed as far as the Motagua River and south as far as Escuintla . However , he also suffered a humiliating rebellion that eventually resulted in the loss of his key Kaqchikel allies . K 'iq 'ab died around 1475 . 
 = = = Internal strife = = = 
 In 1470 a rebellion shook Q 'umarkaj during a great celebration that saw a large gathering that included representatives of all the most important highland peoples . Two sons of K 'iq 'ab together with some of his vassals rebelled against their king , killing many high ranking lords , Kaqchikel warriors and members of the Kaweq lineage . The rebels tried to kill K 'iq 'ab himself but he was defended by sons loyal to him in Pakaman , on the outskirts of the city . As a result of the rebellion , K 'iq 'ab was forced to make concessions to the rebelling K 'iche ' lords . The newly empowered K 'iche ' lords turned against their Kaqchikel allies , who were forced to flee Q 'umarkaj and found their own capital at Iximche . 
 After the death of king K 'iq 'ab in 1475 the K 'iche ' were engaged in warfare against both the Tz 'utujils and the Kaqchikels , perhaps in an attempt to recover the former power of Q 'umarkaj . A short time after the death of K 'iq 'ab , under the leadership of Tepepul , Q 'umarkaj attacked Iximche , the capital of the Kaqchikels , and suffered a disastrous defeat that greatly weakened the K 'iche ' . After this Q 'umarkaj never again directly challenged the Kaqchikels of Iximche . The next leader after Tepepul was Tekum , who was a son of K 'iq <unk> who led the K 'iche 's against the Tz 'utujils and was killed in battle near the south shore of Lake Atitlan . 
 Late in the history of Q 'umarkaj , the Nijaib appear to have been challenging the ruling Kaweq house for supremacy . 
 = = = Conquest and destruction = = = 
 In March 1524 , the Spanish conquistador Pedro de Alvarado entered Q 'umarkaj when invited by the remaining lords of the K 'iche ' , after he defeated the K 'iche ' army in the Quetzaltenango valley , in a battle that had resulted in the death of Tecun Uman , one of the four lords of the city . Alvarado feared that a trap had been laid for him by the K 'iche ' lords but entered the city anyway . However , he encamped on the plain outside the city rather than accepting lodgings inside . Fearing the great number of K 'iche ' warriors gathered outside the city and that his cavalry would not be able to manoeuvre in the narrow streets of Q 'umarkaj , he invited the highest lords of the city , Oxib @-@ Keh ( the ajpop ) and Beleheb @-@ Tzy ( the ajpop k 'amha ) to visit him in his camp . As soon as they did so , he seized them and kept them as prisoners in his camp . The K 'iche ' warriors , seeing their lords taken prisoner , attacked the Spaniards ' indigenous allies and managed to kill one of the Spanish soldiers . At this point Alvarado decided to have the captured K 'iche ' lords burnt to death , he then proceeded to burn the entire city . 
 = = = Modern history = = = 
 The site was extensively documented in the colonial era . Francisco Ximénez , who first revealed the K 'iche ' epic Popul Vuh to the world , visited Q 'umarkaj in the final years of the 17th century . Miguel Rivera y Maestre wrote a report of the site for the government of Guatemala in 1834 . In 1840 John Lloyd Stephens and Frederick Catherwood paid a brief visit to the site after reading Rivera y Maestre 's report , and Catherwood mapped the site and produced a drawing of the Temple of Tohil . In 1865 , the French architect Cesar Daly mapped the five clustered sites that include Q 'umarkaj , although the maps have since been lost . A more detailed survey of the site was made by Alfred P. Maudslay in 1887 , being published between 1889 and 1902 . Archeological excavations were carried out in the 1950s and the 1970s . 
 Jorge F. Guillemín cleared the ruins in 1956 , mapped the surviving structures , as well as mapping the central K 'iche ' region and Q 'umarkaj 's satellite sites . The State University of New York at Albany spent three seasons excavating the ruins in the early 1970s . Kenneth Brown of the University of Houston started major excavations at Q 'umarkaj in 1977 . 
 In 2003 , the Proyecto <unk> Q ’ um ’ <unk> ( " Q 'umarkaj <unk> Project " ) has worked to reconstruct the history and socio @-@ political organisation of the city through archaeological studies combined with ethnohistorical investigations . 
 The archaeological site is still used for traditional Maya ceremonies , and is one of the most popular destinations in Guatemala for this kind of ritual activity , especially at the solstices and for the New Year . 
 = = Site description = = 
 The site can be visited , although little restoration work has been done to it . Various temple pyramids , the remains of palaces ( mostly reduced to mounds of rubble ) and a court for playing the Mesoamerican ballgame can be seen in the site core . In the Greater Q 'umarkaj area there were four ballcourts , one in each of the four major political divisions of the city , testifying to the central role of the ballgame ritual in the sociopolitical organisation of the city . 
 Cut stone originally facing the buildings was taken to build the new buildings of Santa Cruz del Quiché ; the ruins were still being mined for construction material through the late 19th century , doing extensive damage to the remains of the old buildings . 
 The major structures of Q 'umarkaj were laid out around a plaza , which had a plaster floor . The K 'iche ' colonnaded buildings at Q 'umarkaj appear to indicate ties with the distant city of Mayapan in the Yucatan Peninsula . The parallels also include skull imagery , effigy figure censers , squatting figures and the generous application of stucco . A combined aerial and surface analysis of the ruins has revealed a strongly patterned arrangement with repeating combinations of pyramids , long structures and <unk> residential complexes . These repeating combinations appear to be linked to the different nimja lineages . In addition there appears to be a larger division of the site , separating it into northwestern and southwestern halves . The dividing line runs from the west along a street to the central plaza , crosses the ballcourt and the plaza , then separates the northern and eastern branches of the site up to the rim of the canyon on the eastern side . This larger site division places six nimja complexes in the northern half and six in the south , although this larger division may not have been strictly along lineage lines , since Kaweq @-@ linked structures are found in both halves of the site . The Kaweq and their allies dominated most of the site , with the Nijaib occupying the eastern portion , possibly as far as the satellite site of Atalaya . 
 = = = Temple of Tohil = = = 
 The plaza was dominated by the Temple of Tohil , who was a jaguar deity associated with the sun and with rain and was the patron deity of Q 'umarkaj . This temple lies on the western side of the main plaza . The standing remains are reduced to the rubble and mud core of the temple , with an opening where modern Maya still make offerings . As late as the middle of the 19th century , this temple was much better preserved and was described by John Lloyd Stephens . Originally the temple consisted of a steep pyramid with stairways on three sides , all except the west , and a temple building was on the summit . The base was 33 feet ( 10 m ) on each side and the exterior of the building was covered in painted stucco . Catherwood 's copy of Rivera y Maestre 's drawing of the temple showed the body of the pyramid divided into four talud @-@ tablero terraces and 19 steps in each of the three stairways , while Rivera y Maestra 's drawing depicts 24 steps and six terraces . Francisco Ximénez , writing at the end of the 17th century , described the temple as the tallest building in Q 'umarkaj . The identity of the temple as that of Tohil was known during the lifetime of Ximénez , when 30 steps were visible in each stairway and the remains of the pillars that supported the temple roof were still standing . The building style of the Temple of Tohil is similar to that of the most important temples of Mayapan and Chichen Itza , far to the north in the Yucatan Peninsula . The pillars possibly once supported an elaborate masonry roof . 
 The Temple of Tohil was used for human sacrifice , the bodies of the sacrificial victims were probably hurled down the front stairway before being decapitated and the heads places on a skull rack . This <unk> was likely to have been located immediately to the southeast of the temple , in an area that is now buried under rubble fallen from the temple itself . 
 An image of a jaguar was found painted onto the stucco of the temple , an animal that was a <unk> of the ruling Kaweq dynasty . 
 = = = Temple of Awilix = = = 
 The Temple of Awilix is on the east side of the plaza . Awilix was the patron goddess of the Nijaib lineage and is identified with <unk> , one of the Hero Twins from the Popul Vuh . According to a drawing made by Rivera y Maestre , the temple of Awilix was not as tall as the temple of Tohil . This structure was apparently the second most important temple in Q 'umarkaj . Originally this temple was formed of a large rectangular platform supporting a smaller platform and a temple structure on the east side . A wide stairway climbed the west side of the temple , it was flanked on the lower level by two large talud @-@ tablero panels . The exterior stonework of the building has been completely stripped away . The temple is similar in form to a temple mound on the west side of the first plaza in Iximche , the <unk> capital of the Kaqchikel Maya . There were four principal phases of construction and there is evidence that the temple had been repaired various times prior to the Conquest . The floor under the third phase of construction had been painted dark green . Archaeological investigations found fragments of incense burners underneath the first building phase . 
 = = = Temple of Jakawitz = = = 
 A large mound on the south side of the plaza was once the Temple of Jakawitz , a deity of the mountains and the patron of the Ajaw K 'iche ' lineage . Like the other structures of Q 'umarkaj , all the stone facing has been robbed , leaving only a rubble and mud core . This structure was part of a complex that consisted of a patio enclosed by the temple on the northern side , a palace on the southern side and a long building on the east . The Jakawitz complex has not been investigated archaeologically . Drawings by Rivera y Maestre suggest that the temple was a narrow building with four or five terraces . 
 = = = Temple of Q 'uq 'umatz = = = 
 The temple of Q 'uq 'umatz was a circular temple of the feathered serpent , and a palace in honour of the <unk> lineage , the ruling dynasty of the city . The temple is now only a circular impression in the surface of the main plaza . It is located directly between the temples of Tohil and Awilix , slightly north of the central axis of the Tohil temple and slightly south of the axis of the Awilix temple . From the traces left in the plaza it is evident that the temple consisted of a circular wall measuring 6 metres ( 20 ft ) across , running around a circular platform , with a 1 @-@ metre ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) wide circular passage between the two . The whole structure probably once supported a roof and there were small stone platforms on the east and west sides of the temple , each about 1 metre ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) wide . 
 The priests of Q 'uq 'umatz were drawn from an important lineage among the ruling Kaweq dynasty and this was likely to have been a source of power and prestige for the Kaweq . The temple of Q 'uq 'umatz must have been completely dismantled very soon after the Spanish Conquest since it is not mentioned by any of the Colonial era visitors , and early drawings of the site show only vegetation where the temple once stood . The tradition of circular temples dedicated to the Feathered Serpent deity was an ancient one in the Mesoamerican cultural region . 
 = = = Ballcourt = = = 
 The Ballcourt lies close to , and just south of , the temple of Tohil , on the southwest side of the plaza . The ballcourt still retains its distinctive shape , although the structures have been robbed of their facing . The visible ballcourt was one of four in Q 'umarkaj and was administered by the Popol <unk> branch of the ruling Kaweq lineage . The ballcourt is aligned east @-@ west with a length of 40 metres ( 130 ft ) . The ballcourt was located exactly between the palaces of the Kaweq and the Ajaw K 'iche ' , which were located 15 metres ( 49 ft ) to the north and the south of the ballcourt . Correspondingly , the north range of the ballcourt appears to have been associated with the Kaweq lineage and the south range with the Ajaw K 'iche ' lineage . 
 = = = Palaces = = = 
 A small palace belonging to the Nijaib lineage was located directly behind the temple of Awilix . These lineage houses , nimja , are found throughout the city of Q 'umarkaj . As with the other buildings of the site , the outer stonework and plastering has been lost . The nimja are long rectangular structures located beside the plazas upon 1 @-@ metre ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) high platforms . Upon these platforms , the palaces generally consisted of two levels , a lower roofed antechamber with a second , higher level supporting the main rooms of the structure . Some of the larger palaces had several stairways giving access to the antechamber , and multiple doors and pillars opening into the rooms of main building . 
 Another nimja palace structure lies to the southeast of the main plaza . Excavations in 1972 uncovered a simple superstructure consisting of a room with a bench at the back and an altar in the middle . Six funerary urns were found in the remains of the palace , one of which was found near the altar and contained rich offerings that included a gold necklace . There were traces of hearths at each extreme of the main chamber . 
 = = = Other structures = = = 
 In the central plaza there are traces of thirteen small platforms that once stood there . Three of these , each measuring 2 @.@ 5 metres ( 8 @.@ 2 ft ) wide , were located to the north of the Temple of K <unk> . A line of five similar structures was also located to the south of the same temple , with an alternating pattern of a circular platform , then a square platform , followed by another circular platform and so on . There was a sixth small platform nearby , which was square in shape . These platforms appear to have served as altars . 
 To the south of the line of platforms are the traces of two larger square platforms . One of these measured 10 metres ( 33 ft ) on each side , the other measured 8 metres ( 26 ft ) per side . A circular impression lies between these two platforms , which is all that remains of another platform , of a different type , that must have stood there . The larger platforms may also have served as auxiliary altars to those of the principle temples . 
 A large square platform in the northwest section of the central plaza , measuring 18 metres ( 59 ft ) on each side , it is located immediately behind the Temple of Tohil and stands 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) high . Although , typically for the site , the outer stonework has been robbed , there are the remains of six layers of plaster on the floor of the platform 's upper surface . This platform has been identified as the <unk> 'al , the platform of gladiators described in early sources . This platform seems to have been closely linked to the military lineages of the Kaweq , such as the Nima <unk> <unk> . 
 Two large platforms lie in the southeastern section of the main plaza , their use remains unknown . 
 = = = Caves = = = 
 In addition , a series of three caves tunnel straight into the limestone immediately to the north of the site . The first and most extensive cave is about 30 meters long with various altars carved into the rock inside . Some modern Quiché , although officially Roman Catholic , still burn candles and incense at the ruined temples . The caves may have represented <unk> <unk> , the " Place of Seven Caves " described in the K 'iche ' origin legend recounted in the Popul Vuh .

 A number of other archaeological sites are included within the area of Greater Q 'umarkaj ( usually referred to as Greater Utatlan ) . 
 = = = Chisalin = = = 
 Chisalin is <unk> known by the alternative names of <unk> ' and <unk> <unk> ' . Chisalin is located a few hundred meters north of Q 'umarkaj . The ruins are located on a narrow strip of land with an area of 110 @,@ 000 square metres ( 1 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 sq ft ) surrounded by steep ravines . On the northeast side the strip is connected to a plateau that forms a part of the plain to the east of Q 'umarkaj . Chisalin has a small , heavily eroded plaza , and the whole strip is occupied by ruins , with the exception of a small section . 
 = = = Pismachi ' = = = 
 Pismachi ' ( sometimes referred to as <unk> ' ) occupies a small plateau 600 metres ( 660 yd ) south of the site core and is surrounded by steep ravines . The plateau is separated from the Q 'umarkaj plateau by the ravine containing the <unk> ' river . Pismachi ' was the K 'iche ' capital before it was moved to nearby Q 'umarkaj , and was probably founded early in the 14th century . Its location was never forgotten by the local K 'iche 's although it was from time to time lost by outside investigators . French missionary Charles Étienne Brasseur de Bourbourg located Pismachi ' in the middle of the 19th century , it was then lost until it was relocated in 1956 by Jorge Guillemín , working in collaboration with the government of Guatemala , the location was reconfirmed by Robert Carmack in 1969 . Although the Pismachi ' plateau is twice the size of the Q 'umarkaj plateau , the ruins occupy a small area on the southeast portion of the hilltop . The ruins are still used for the rituals of modern K 'iche ' shamans . 
 = = = Atalaya = = = 
 Atalaya ( Spanish for " watchtower " ) is located at a distance of 600 metres ( 660 yd ) to the east of the site core . The site was built upon four terraces that dominated the approach to Q 'umarkaj , at the beginning of the eastern plain occupied by the modern town of Santa Cruz del Quiché . The site was very small , covering an area of 3 @,@ 250 square metres ( 35 @,@ 000 sq ft ) . A paved avenue ( or sacbe ) is said by locals to have passed the tower , which was closely linked to the Nijaib lineage . Between Q 'umarkaj and Atalaya there was a place where criminals were punished . Atalaya is used for modern K 'iche ' rituals and is the focus of local folklore , which relates that <unk> <unk> is buried there and that it is haunted by <unk> spirits . Towards the end of the 20th century the majority of the land making up the site still belonged to the Rojas family , descendents of the kings of Q 'umarkaj . 
 = = = Pakaman = = = 
 Pakaman is located 1 @,@ 000 metres ( 1 @,@ 100 yd ) east of Atalaya and 1 @.@ 6 kilometres ( 1 mi ) east of Q 'umarkaj . The same <unk> that passed the north side of Atalaya is said to pass south of Pakaman . The original name of Pakaman is likely to have been <unk> ( " place of arrival " ) and was the first important outpost on the entry road to Q 'umarkaj . 
 = Hell Awaits = 
 Hell Awaits is the second studio album by American thrash metal band Slayer , released through Metal Blade Records in 1985 . The band 's previous release , Show No Mercy , became Metal Blade Records ' highest selling release ; as a result , producer Brian Slagel desired to release a second Slayer album . To that end , Slagel financed a recording budget ( Show No Mercy was paid for by band members ) and recruited several experienced producers to help in the studio . 
 Lyrical themes on Hell Awaits include hell and Satan , as their debut . The intro of the first track " Hell Awaits " played backwards reveals the repeated phrase " join us " . Musically , the album features the band 's most progressive and diverse work compared to their previous releases , and according to Kerry King , he and Jeff Hanneman were very into Mercyful Fate at the time , which then led to the longer and more progressive songs . Defined as " influential to future extreme metal acts , " the most popular songs from Hell Awaits were re @-@ recorded by various underground metal bands and have appeared on several tribute albums .

On seeing Slayer in the studio , Fair stated , " Wow , these guys are really angry , " as he was inexperienced working with heavy metal musicians . Slagel financed the album , in stark contrast to Show No Mercy , which was financed by singer Tom Araya , who used his earnings as a respiratory therapist , and a loan from guitarist Kerry King 's father . 
 The budget organized by Slagel allowed for professional assistance . Bernie Grundman provided audio mastering , Eddy Schreyer worked on remastering , and Bill Metoyer , who worked on the band 's earlier release Haunting the Chapel , acted as sound engineer . The recording featured audio effects such as the intro to " Hell Awaits " , a reversed recording of a demonic @-@ sounding voice repeating " Join us " , ending with " Welcome back " . Still , Araya later stated the album had poor production quality : " Nowadays , production @-@ wise , it 's so under par . But for what it was at the time , those are amazing records to me . I guess we could go in and redo it . But why ruin it ? " 
 Drummer Dave Lombardo , on the other hand , asserts the album was professionally done compared to Show No Mercy : " I didn 't have to overdub the cymbals , and we had a really good engineer . " Lombardo 's favorite song is " At Dawn They Sleep " , " because it was kind of slow and grungy , but then it had that double @-@ bass part at the end . " While recording the track , neither guitarists King or Jeff Hanneman who wrote the lyrics were in the studio — only Araya and Slagel . On reading the lyrics , which featured a misspelled word , Araya sang it as it was spelled , although it 's not a real word . The song " Hardening of the Arteries " on the album ends with the a very similar section that makes up the beginning of the song " Hell Awaits " and is also one of the only Slayer songs to fade out on a continuous riff .

 To promote Hell Awaits , Slayer embarked on the Combat Tour with Venom and Exodus . Exodus guitarist Gary Holt commented , " We immediately bonded with the Slayer guys . It was two bands of friends playing with one band of heroes , you know ? We were just star @-@ struck . " 
 Inside Venom 's tour bus ( the first time Slayer had been in one ) the band members got drunk with Venom , while listening to Hell Awaits . Araya entered the bus " hammered out of his mind , " according to Lombardo , saying " I gotta take a piss ! Where 's the bathroom in this thing ? " Venom singer Conrad " Cronos " Lant responded , saying " Right here — right here in my mouth ! " Araya took him literally and urinated on his hair . Cronos got up and punched him in the face , the two blamed each other all night , and Araya continued the tour with a black eye . Araya won 't discuss the incident other than saying that he was drunk and it was a very disrespectful thing to do .

 Although it did not enter any charts , Hell Awaits was hailed upon its release as Slayer 's most progressive recording , featuring much darker thrash @-@ oriented style , with unusual arrangements such as varying tempos , and dissonant nuances that " paved the way to a wholly distinctive sound all their own , " according to AllMusic reviewer Eduardo Rivadavia . Rivadavia awarded the album four out of five stars , calling it an " irresistible force , but one could still make a confident point that Hell Awaits ' uniquely daunting compositions arguably proved just as influential to future extreme metal acts . " It has sold over 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 records worldwide according to Brian Slagel . 
 In the book Legends of Rock Guitar , Hell Awaits was defined as " a psychotic exploration into the depths of Satanism and physical torture . " The book , a chronology of the great guitarists of rock which includes both Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman , observed the band 's evolution in comparison with their previous album , Show No Mercy , saying , " The musicianship is improved , as is lead singer Tom Araya 's voice , making the band sound less like hacks and more like metal fiends . The sludgy riffs , which were pure [ Black ] Sabbath , are offset by some of King 's and Hanneman 's faster solos , giving Slayer entrée into the speed metal realm . " 
 = = Influence = = 
 Musicians such as singer Phil Anselmo and drummer Gene Hoglan cite Hell Awaits as an influence . Anselmo — known for his work with Pantera , Down , and <unk> Ritual — explained in an interview with D. X. Ferris , author of the book about the album Reign in Blood , that " Hell Awaits just holds the entire thing . Every bit of everything to do with heavy music . [ Slayer ] are gods , the best band from California , for sure . " Norwegian musician Frode Sivertsen ( also known as " E. N. Death " ) , former member of the black metal band Gehenna , says the song " Hell Awaits " and Slayer 's music in general has influenced him as a musician , ranking the album in his top five . Dimebag Darrell of Pantera and Damageplan picked " At Dawn They Sleep " among his 12 Favorite Tunes in the March 1993 issue of Guitar World , stating that Slayer taught him " how to play with guts and aggression " . 
 Defined as " influential to future extreme metal acts , " the most popular songs from Hell Awaits were re @-@ recorded by various underground metal bands , and have appeared in several tribute albums , such as Slatanic Slaughter II and Gateway to Hell 1 & 2 . The song " Hell Awaits " has been covered by Cradle of Filth and Incantation , " Kill Again " by <unk> , " Praise of Death " by Sinister , " At Dawn They Sleep " by Six Feet Under , and " <unk> " by Sadistic Intent , Benediction and <unk> .

 = Albatross = 
 Albatrosses , of the biological family Diomedeidae , are large seabirds allied to the procellariids , storm petrels and diving petrels in the order Procellariiformes ( the tubenoses ) . They range widely in the Southern Ocean and the North Pacific . They are absent from the North Atlantic , although fossil remains show they once occurred there and occasional vagrants are found . Albatrosses are among the largest of flying birds , and the great albatrosses ( genus Diomedea ) have the largest wingspans of any extant birds , reaching up to 3 @.@ 7 metres ( 12 feet ) . The albatrosses are usually regarded as falling into four genera , but there is disagreement over the number of species . 
 Albatrosses are highly efficient in the air , using dynamic soaring and slope soaring to cover great distances with little exertion . They feed on squid , fish and krill by either scavenging , surface seizing or diving . Albatrosses are colonial , nesting for the most part on remote oceanic islands , often with several species nesting together . Pair bonds between males and females form over several years , with the use of " ritualised dances " , and will last for the life of the pair . A breeding season can take over a year from laying to fledging , with a single egg laid in each breeding attempt . A Laysan albatross , named Wisdom , on Midway Island is recognised as the oldest wild bird in the world ; she was first banded in 1956 by Chandler Robbins . 
 Of the 22 species of albatross recognised by the IUCN , all are listed as at some level of concern ; 3 species are Critically Endangered , 5 species are Endangered , 7 species are Near Threatened , and 7 species are Vulnerable . Numbers of albatrosses have declined in the past due to harvesting for feathers , but today the albatrosses are threatened by introduced species , such as rats and feral cats that attack eggs , chicks and nesting adults ; by pollution ; by a serious decline in fish stocks in many regions largely due to overfishing ; and by longline fishing . <unk> fisheries pose the greatest threat , as feeding birds are attracted to the bait , become hooked on the lines , and drown . Identified stakeholders such as governments , conservation organisations and people in the fishing industry are all working toward reducing this bycatch . 
 = = Biology = = 
 = = = Taxonomy and evolution = = = 
 The albatrosses comprise between 13 and 24 species ( the number of species is still a matter of some debate , 21 being the most commonly accepted number ) in four genera . These genera are the great albatrosses ( Diomedea ) , the mollymawks ( Thalassarche ) , the North Pacific albatrosses ( Phoebastria ) , and the sooty albatrosses or <unk> ( Phoebetria ) . The North Pacific albatrosses are considered to be a sister taxon to the great albatrosses , while the sooty albatrosses are considered closer to the mollymawks . 
 The taxonomy of the albatross group has been a source of much debate . The Sibley @-@ Ahlquist taxonomy places seabirds , birds of prey and many others in a greatly enlarged order , Ciconiiformes , whereas the ornithological organisations in North America , Europe , South Africa , Australia , and New Zealand retain the more traditional order Procellariiformes . The albatrosses can be separated from the other Procellariiformes both genetically and through morphological characteristics , size , their legs , and the arrangement of their nasal tubes ( see below : Morphology and flight ) . 
 Within the family , the assignment of genera has been debated for over 100 years . Originally placed into a single genus , Diomedea , they were rearranged by Reichenbach into four different genera in 1852 , then lumped back together and split apart again several times , acquiring 12 different genus names in total ( though never more than eight at one time ) by 1965 ( Diomedea , Phoebastria , Thalassarche , Phoebetria , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , and <unk> ) . 
 By 1965 , in an attempt to bring some order back to the classification of albatrosses , they were lumped into two genera , Phoebetria ( the sooty albatrosses which most closely seemed to resemble the <unk> and were at the time considered " primitive " ) and Diomedea ( the rest ) . Though there was a case for the simplification of the family ( particularly the nomenclature ) , the classification was based on the morphological analysis by Elliott Coues in 1866 , and paid little attention to more recent studies and even ignored some of Coues 's suggestions . 
 More recent research by Gary Nunn of the American Museum of Natural History ( 1996 ) and other researchers around the world studied the mitochondrial DNA of all 14 accepted species , finding four , not two , monophyletic groups within the albatrosses . They proposed the resurrection of two of the old genus names , Phoebastria for the North Pacific albatrosses and Thalassarche for the mollymawks , with the great albatrosses retaining Diomedea and the sooty albatrosses staying in Phoebetria . Both the British Ornithologists ' Union and the South African authorities split the albatrosses into four genera as Nunn suggested , and the change has been accepted by the majority of researchers . 
 While some agree on the number of genera , fewer agree on the number of species . Historically , up to 80 different taxa have been described by different researchers ; most of these were incorrectly identified juvenile birds . 
 Based on the work on albatross genera , Robertson and Nunn went on in 1998 to propose a revised taxonomy with 24 different species , compared to the 14 then accepted . This expanded taxonomy elevated many established subspecies to full species , but was criticised for not using , in every case , peer reviewed information to justify the splits . Since then , further studies have in some instances supported or disproved the splits ; a 2004 paper analysing the mitochondrial DNA and microsatellites agreed with the conclusion that the Antipodean albatross and the Tristan albatross were distinct from the wandering albatross , per Robertson and Nunn , but found that the suggested Gibson 's albatross , Diomedea <unk> , was not distinct from the Antipodean albatross . For the most part , an interim taxonomy of 21 species is accepted by ITIS and many other researchers , though by no means all — in 2004 <unk> and Wink called for the number of species to be reduced to 13 ( including the lumping of the Amsterdam albatross with the wandering albatross ) , although this paper was itself controversial . On all sides is the widespread agreement on the need for further research to clarify the issue . 
 Sibley and Ahlquist 's molecular study of the evolution of the bird families has put the radiation of the Procellariiformes in the Oligocene period ( 35 – 30 million years ago ) , though this group probably originated earlier , with a fossil sometimes attributed to the order , a seabird known as Tytthostonyx , being found in late Cretaceous rocks ( 70 mya ) . The molecular evidence suggests that the storm petrels were the first to diverge from the ancestral stock , and the albatrosses next , with the <unk> and diving petrels separating later . The earliest fossil albatrosses were found in Eocene to Oligocene rocks , although some of these are only tentatively assigned to the family and none appear to be particularly close to the living forms . They are <unk> ( Middle Eocene of Uzbekistan ) , Manu ( early Oligocene of New Zealand ) , and an undescribed form from the Late Oligocene of South Carolina . Similar to the last was <unk> , formerly often considered a petrel but now accepted as an albatross . It is from the Middle Miocene of France , a time when the split between the four modern genera was already underway as evidenced by Phoebastria californica and Diomedea milleri , both being mid @-@ Miocene species from <unk> Hill , California . These show that the split between the great albatrosses and the North Pacific albatrosses occurred by 15 mya . Similar fossil finds in the Southern Hemisphere put the split between the <unk> and mollymawks at 10 mya . The fossil record of the albatrosses in the Northern Hemisphere is more complete than that of the southern , and many fossil forms of albatross have been found in the North Atlantic , which today has no albatrosses . The remains of a colony of short @-@ tailed albatrosses have been uncovered on the island of Bermuda , and the majority of fossil albatrosses from the North Atlantic have been of the genus Phoebastria ( the North Pacific albatrosses ) ; one , Phoebastria anglica , has been found in deposits in both North Carolina and England . Due to convergent evolution in particular of the leg and foot bones , remains of the prehistoric pseudotooth birds ( Pelagornithidae ) may be mistaken for those of extinct albatrosses ; Manu may be such a case , and quite certainly the supposed giant albatross femur from the Early Pleistocene <unk> Formation at Kakegawa , Japan , actually is from one of the last pseudotooth birds . For more data on fossil species of the living albatross genera , see the genus articles . 
 = = = Morphology and flight = = = 
 The albatrosses are a group of large to very large birds ; they are the largest of the <unk> . The bill is large , strong and sharp @-@ edged , the upper mandible terminating in a large hook . This bill is composed of several horny plates , and along the sides are the two " tubes " , long nostrils that give the order its former name . The tubes of all albatrosses are along the sides of the bill , unlike the rest of the Procellariiformes where the tubes run along the top of the bill . These tubes allow the albatrosses to measure the exact airspeed in flight ; the nostrils are analogous to the pitot tubes in modern aircraft . The albatross needs accurate airspeed measurement in order to perform dynamic soaring . Like other Procellariiformes , they use their uniquely developed sense of smell to locate potential food sources , whereas most birds depend on eyesight . The feet have no hind toe and the three anterior toes are completely webbed . The legs are strong for Procellariiformes , making them and the giant petrels the only members of that order which can walk well on land . 
 Albatrosses , along with all Procellariiformes , must excrete the salts they ingest in drinking sea water and eating marine invertebrates . All birds have an enlarged nasal gland at the base of the bill , above their eyes . This gland is inactive in species that do not require it , but in the Procellariiformes it acts as a salt gland . Scientists are uncertain as to its exact processes , but do know in general terms that it removes salt by secreting a 5 % saline solution that drips out of their nose or is forcibly ejected . 
 The adult plumage of most of the albatrosses is usually some variation of dark upper @-@ wing and back with white undersides , often compared to that of a gull . The extent of colouration varies : the southern royal albatross is almost completely white except for the ends and trailing edges of the wings in fully mature males , while the Amsterdam albatross has an almost juvenile @-@ like breeding plumage with a great deal of brown , particularly a strong brown band around the chest . Several species of mollymawks and North Pacific albatrosses have face markings like eye patches or have grey or yellow on the head and nape . Three albatross species , the black @-@ footed albatross and the two sooty albatrosses , vary completely from the usual patterns and are almost entirely dark brown ( or dark grey in places in the case of the light @-@ mantled albatross ) . Albatrosses take several years to get their full adult breeding plumage . 
 The wingspans of the largest great albatrosses ( genus Diomedea ) are the largest of any bird , exceeding 340 cm ( 11 @.@ 2 ft ) , although the other species ' wingspans are considerably smaller at no more than 1 @.@ 75 m ( 5 @.@ 7 ft ) . The wings are stiff and cambered , with thickened streamlined leading edges . Albatrosses travel huge distances with two techniques used by many long @-@ winged seabirds : dynamic soaring and slope soaring . Dynamic soaring involves repeatedly rising into wind and descending downwind , thus gaining energy from the vertical wind gradient . The only effort expended is in the turns at the top and bottom of every such loop . This maneuver allows the bird to cover almost a thousand kilometres a day without flapping its wings . Slope soaring uses the rising air on the windward side of large waves . Albatross have high glide ratios , around 22 : 1 to 23 : 1 , meaning that for every metre they drop , they can travel forward 22 metres . They are aided in soaring by a shoulder @-@ lock , a sheet of tendon that locks the wing when fully extended , allowing the wing to be kept outstretched without any muscle expenditure , a morphological adaptation they share with the giant petrels . 
 Albatrosses combine these soaring techniques with the use of predictable weather systems : albatrosses in the Southern Hemisphere flying north from their colonies will take a clockwise route , and those flying south will fly counterclockwise . Albatrosses are so well adapted to this lifestyle that their heart rates while flying are close to their basal heart rate when resting . This efficiency is such that the most energetically demanding aspect of a foraging trip is not the distance covered , but the landings , take @-@ offs and hunting they undertake having found a food source . A common assumption is that albatrosses must be able to sleep in flight , although no direct evidence has ever been obtained . 
 This efficient long @-@ distance travelling underlies the albatross 's success as a long @-@ distance forager , covering great distances and expending little energy looking for patchily distributed food sources . Their adaptation to gliding flight makes them dependent on wind and waves , however , as their long wings are ill @-@ suited to powered flight and most species lack the muscles and energy to undertake sustained flapping flight . Albatrosses in calm seas are forced to rest on the ocean 's surface until the wind picks up again . The North Pacific albatrosses can use a flight style known as flap @-@ gliding , where the bird progresses by bursts of flapping followed by gliding . When taking off , albatrosses need to take a run up to allow enough air to move under the wing to provide lift . 
 The dynamic soaring of albatrosses is inspiring to airplane designers : German aerospace engineer Johannes Traugott and colleagues have charted the albatross 's nuanced flight pattern and are looking for ways to apply this to aircraft , especially in the area of drones and unmanned aircraft . 
 = = = Distribution and range at sea = = = 
 Most albatrosses range in the Southern Hemisphere from Antarctica to Australia , South Africa and South America . The exceptions to this are the four North Pacific albatrosses , of which three occur exclusively in the North Pacific , from Hawaii to Japan , California and Alaska ; and one , the waved albatross , breeds in the Galápagos Islands and feeds off the coast of South America . The need for wind to enable gliding is the reason albatrosses are for the most part confined to higher latitudes : being unsuited to sustained flapping flight makes crossing the doldrums extremely difficult . The exception , the waved albatross , is able to live in the equatorial waters around the Galápagos Islands because of the cool waters of the Humboldt Current and the resulting winds . 
 It is not known for certain why the albatrosses became extinct in the North Atlantic , although rising sea levels due to an interglacial warming period are thought to have submerged the site of a short @-@ tailed albatross colony that has been excavated in Bermuda . Some southern species have occasionally turned up as vagrants in the North Atlantic and can become exiled , remaining there for decades . One of these exiles , a black @-@ browed albatross , returned to gannet colonies in Scotland for many years in an attempt to breed . 
 The use of satellite tracking is teaching scientists a great deal about the way albatrosses forage across the ocean to find food . They undertake no annual migration , but disperse widely after breeding — Southern Hemisphere species often undertake circumpolar trips . There is also evidence of separate ranges for different species at sea . A comparison of the foraging niches of two related species that breed on Campbell Island , the Campbell albatross and the grey @-@ headed albatross , showed the Campbell albatross primarily fed over the Campbell Plateau whereas the grey @-@ headed albatross fed in more pelagic , oceanic waters . Wandering albatrosses also react strongly to bathymetry , feeding only in waters deeper than 1000 m ( <unk> ft ) ; so rigidly did the satellite plots match this contour that one scientist remarked , " It almost appears as if the birds notice and obey a ' No Entry ' sign where the water shallows to less than 1000 m " . There is also evidence of different ranges for the two sexes of the same species ; a study of Tristan albatrosses breeding on Gough Island showed that males foraged to the west of Gough and females to the east . 
 Birdlife has satellite tracking records for each of the 22 species of albatross in their Seabird Tracking Database . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 The albatross diet is predominantly cephalopods , fish , crustaceans , and offal ( organ meat ) , although they will also scavenge carrion and feed on other zooplankton . It should be noted that for most species a comprehensive understanding of diet is known for only the breeding season , when the albatrosses regularly return to land and study is possible . The importance of each of these food sources varies from species to species , and even from population to population ; some concentrate on squid alone , others take more krill or fish . Of the two albatross species found in Hawaii , one , the black @-@ footed albatross , takes mostly fish while the Laysan feeds on squid . 
 The use of data loggers at sea that record ingestion of water against time ( providing a likely time of feeding ) suggests that albatrosses predominantly feed during the day . Analysis of the squid beaks regurgitated by albatrosses has shown that many of the squid eaten are too large to have been caught alive , and include mid @-@ water species likely to be beyond the reach of albatross , suggesting that , for some species ( like the wandering albatross ) , scavenged squid may be an important part of the diet . The source of these dead squid is a matter of debate ; some certainly comes from squid fisheries , but in nature it primarily comes from the die @-@ off that occurs after squid spawning and the vomit of squid @-@ eating whales ( sperm whales , pilot whales and southern bottlenose whales ) . The diet of other species , like the black @-@ browed albatross or the grey @-@ headed albatross , is rich with smaller species of squid that tend to sink after death , and scavenging is not assumed to play a large role in their diet . The waved albatross has been observed practising kleptoparasitism , harassing boobies to steal their food , making it the only member of its order to do so regularly . 
 Until recently it was thought that albatrosses were predominantly surface feeders , swimming at the surface and snapping up squid and fish pushed to the surface by currents , predators , or death . The deployment of capillary depth recorders , which record the maximum dive depth undertaken by a bird , has shown that while some species , like the wandering albatross , do not dive deeper than a metre , some species , like the light @-@ mantled albatross , have a mean diving depth of almost 5 m and can dive as deep as 12 @.@ 5 m . In addition to surface feeding and diving , they have also been observed plunge diving from the air to snatch prey . 
 = = = Breeding and dancing = = = 
 Albatrosses are colonial , usually nesting on isolated islands ; where colonies are on larger landmasses , they are found on exposed headlands with good approaches from the sea in several directions , like the colony on the Otago Peninsula in Dunedin , New Zealand . Many Buller 's albatrosses and black @-@ footed albatrosses nest under trees in open forest . Colonies vary from the very dense aggregations favoured by the mollymawks ( black @-@ browed albatross colonies on the Falkland Islands have densities of 70 nests per 100 m2 ) to the much looser groups and widely spaced individual nests favoured by the sooty and great albatrosses . All albatross colonies are on islands that historically were free of land mammals . Albatrosses are highly philopatric , meaning they will usually return to their natal colony to breed . This tendency to return to their point of origin to breed is so strong that a study of Laysan albatross showed that the average distance between hatching site and the site where a bird established its own territory was 22 m ( 72 ft ) . 
 Albatrosses live much longer than other birds ; they delay breeding for longer and invest more effort into fewer young . Most species survive upwards of 50 years , the oldest recorded being a northern royal albatross that was ringed as an adult and survived for another 51 years , giving it an estimated age of 61 . Given that most albatross ringing projects are considerably younger than that , it is thought likely that other species will prove to live at least as long . 
 Albatrosses reach sexual maturity slowly , after about five years , but even once they have reached maturity , they will not begin to breed for another couple of years ( even up to 10 years for some species ) . Young non @-@ breeders will attend a colony prior to beginning to breed , spending many years practising the elaborate breeding rituals and " dances " that the family is famous for . Birds arriving back at the colony for the first time already have the stereotyped behaviours that compose albatross language , but can neither " read " that behaviour as exhibited by other birds nor respond appropriately . After a period of trial and error learning , the young birds learn the syntax and perfect the dances . This language is mastered more rapidly if the younger birds are around older birds . 
 The repertoire of behaviour involves synchronised performances of various actions such as preening , pointing , calling , bill clacking , staring , and combinations of such behaviours ( like the sky @-@ call ) . When a bird first returns to the colony it will dance with many partners , but after a number of years the number of birds an individual will interact with drops , until one partner is chosen and a pair is formed . They then continue to perfect an individual language that will eventually be unique to that one pair . Having established a pair bond that will last for life , however , most of that dance will never be used again . 
 Albatrosses are held to undertake these elaborate and painstaking rituals to ensure that the appropriate partner has been chosen and to perfect partner recognition , as egg laying and chick rearing is a huge investment . Even species that can complete an egg @-@ laying cycle in under a year seldom lay eggs in consecutive years . The great albatrosses ( like the wandering albatross ) take over a year to raise a chick from laying to fledging . Albatrosses lay a single <unk> egg , white with reddish brown spots , in a breeding season ; if the egg is lost to predators or accidentally broken , then no further breeding attempts are made that year . The larger eggs weigh from 200 to 510 g ( 7 @.@ 1 – 18 @.@ 0 oz ) . The " divorce " of a pair is a rare occurrence , due to the diminished life @-@ time reproductive success it causes , and usually happens only after several years of breeding failure . 
 All the southern albatrosses create large nests for their egg , utilizing grass , shrubs , soil , peat , and even penguin feathers , whereas the three species in the North Pacific make more rudimentary nests . The waved albatross , on the other hand , makes no nest and will even move its egg around the pair 's territory , as much as 50 m ( 160 ft ) , sometimes causing it to lose the egg . In all albatross species , both parents incubate the egg in stints that last between one day and three weeks . Incubation lasts around 70 to 80 days ( longer for the larger albatrosses ) , the longest incubation period of any bird . It can be an energetically demanding process , with the adult losing as much as 83 g ( 2 @.@ 9 oz ) of body weight a day . 
 After hatching , the chick , which is semi @-@ altricial , is brooded and guarded for three weeks until it is large enough to defend and thermoregulate itself . During this period the parents feed the chick small meals when they relieve each other from duty . After the brooding period is over , the chick is fed in regular intervals by both parents . The parents adopt alternative patterns of short and long foraging trips , providing meals that weigh around 12 % of their body weight ( around 600 g ( 21 oz ) ) . The meals are composed of fresh squid , fish and krill , as well as stomach oil , an energy @-@ rich food that is lighter to carry than undigested prey items . This oil is created in a stomach organ known as a proventriculus from digested prey items by most Procellariiformes , and gives them their distinctive musty smell . 
 Albatross chicks take a long time to fledge . In the case of the great albatrosses , it can take up to 280 days ; even for the smaller albatrosses , it takes anywhere between 140 and 170 days . Like many seabirds , albatross chicks will gain enough weight to be heavier than their parents , and prior to fledging they use these reserves to build up body condition ( particularly growing all their flight feathers ) , usually fledging at the same weight as their parents . Between 15 % and 65 % of those fledged survive to breed . Albatross chicks fledge on their own and receive no further help from their parents , who return to the nest after fledging , unaware their chick has left . Studies of juveniles dispersing at sea have suggested an innate migration behaviour , a genetically coded navigation route , which helps young birds when they are first out at sea .

 = = = Etymology = = = 
 The name albatross is derived from the Arabic al @-@ <unk> or al @-@ <unk> ( a pelican ; literally , " the diver " ) , which travelled to English via the Portuguese form alcatraz ( " gannet " ) , which is also the origin of the name of the former prison , Alcatraz . The OED notes that the word alcatraz was originally applied to the frigatebird ; the modification to albatross was perhaps influenced by Latin albus , meaning " white " , in contrast to frigatebirds which are black . In modern Portuguese , the word used for the bird , <unk> , is in turn derived from the English albatross . 
 They were once commonly known as <unk> birds or <unk> birds , particularly those of the North Pacific . In the Southern Hemisphere , the name <unk> is still well established in some areas , which is a corrupted form of <unk> @-@ <unk> , an old Dutch name for the northern fulmar . The name Diomedea , assigned to the albatrosses by Linnaeus , references the mythical metamorphosis of the companions of the Greek warrior Diomedes into birds . Finally , the name for the order , Procellariiformes , comes from the Latin word procella meaning " a violent wind " or " a storm " . 
 = = = In culture = = = 
 Albatrosses have been described as " the most legendary of all birds " . An albatross is a central emblem in The Rime of the Ancient Mariner by Samuel Taylor Coleridge ; a captive albatross is also a metaphor for the poète <unk> in a poem by Charles Baudelaire . It is from the Coleridge poem that the albatross metaphor is derived ; someone bearing a burden or facing an obstacle is said to have " an albatross around his neck " , the punishment given in the poem to the mariner who killed the albatross . There is a widespread myth that sailors believe it disastrous to shoot or harm an albatross , due in part to the poem ; in truth , sailors regularly killed and ate them , as reported by James Cook in 1772 . On the other hand , it has been reported that sailors caught the birds but let them free again ; the possible reason is that albatrosses were often regarded as the souls of lost sailors , so killing them was supposed to bring bad luck . The head of an albatross being caught with a hook is used as the emblem of the Cape <unk> , i.e. sailors who have rounded Cape Horn on freighters under sail ; captains of such ships even received themselves the title " albatrosses " in the Cape <unk> ' organisation . 
 In golf , shooting three under par on a single hole has recently been termed scoring an " albatross " , as a continuation on the birdie and eagle theme . 
 The Maori used the wing bones of the albatross to carve flutes . 
 = = = Birdwatching = = = 
 Albatrosses are popular birds for birdwatchers and their colonies are popular destinations for ecotourists . Regular birdwatching trips are taken out of many coastal towns and cities , like Monterey , Kaikoura , Wollongong , Sydney , Port Fairy , Hobart and Cape Town , to see pelagic seabirds . Albatrosses are easily attracted to these sightseeing boats by the deployment of fish oil and burley into the sea . Visits to colonies can be very popular : the northern royal albatross colony at Taiaroa Head in New Zealand attracts 40 @,@ 000 visitors a year , and more isolated colonies are regular attractions on cruises to subantarctic islands .

 In spite of often being accorded legendary status , albatrosses have not escaped either indirect or direct pressure from humans . Early encounters with albatrosses by Polynesians and Aleut Indians resulted in hunting and in some cases extirpation from some islands ( such as Easter Island ) . As Europeans began sailing the world , they too began to hunt albatross , " fishing " for them from boats to serve at the table or blasting them for sport . This sport reached its peak on emigration lines bound for Australia , and only died down when ships became too fast to fish from , and regulations forbade the discharge of weapons for safety reasons . In the 19th century , albatross colonies , particularly those in the North Pacific , were harvested for the feather trade , leading to the near @-@ extinction of the short @-@ tailed albatross . 
 Of the 21 albatross species recognised by IUCN on their Red List , 19 are threatened , and the other two are " near threatened " . Three species ( as recognised by the IUCN ) are considered critically endangered : the Amsterdam albatross , Tristan albatross and waved albatross . One of the main threats is commercial longline fishing , as the albatrosses and other seabirds — which will readily feed on offal — are attracted to the set bait , become hooked on the lines and drown . An estimated 100 @,@ 000 albatross per year are killed in this fashion . Unregulated pirate fisheries exacerbate the problem . 
 On Midway Atoll , collisions between Laysan albatross and aircraft have resulted in human and bird deaths as well as severe disruptions in military flight operations . Studies were made in the late 1950s and early 1960s that examined the results of control methods such as the killing of birds , the levelling and clearing of land to eliminate updrafts and the destruction of annual nesting sites . Tall structures such as traffic control and radio towers killed 3000 birds in flight collisions during 1964 – 1965 before the towers were taken down . Closure of Naval Air Facility Midway in 1993 eliminated the problem of collisions with military aircraft . Recent reductions in human activity on the island have helped reduce bird deaths , though lead paint pollution near military buildings continues to poison birds by ingestion . Albatross plumes were popular in the early 20th century . In 1909 alone over 300 @,@ 000 albatrosses were killed on Midway Island and Laysan Island for their plumes . 
 Another threat to albatrosses is introduced species , such as rats or feral cats , which directly attack albatrosses or their chicks and eggs . Albatrosses have evolved to breed on islands where land mammals are absent and have not developed defences against them . Even species as small as mice can be detrimental ; on Gough Island the chicks of Tristan albatrosses are attacked and eaten alive by introduced house mice . Introduced species can have other indirect effects : cattle overgrazed essential cover on Amsterdam Island , threatening the Amsterdam albatross ; on other islands introduced plants reduce potential nesting habitat . 
 Ingestion of plastic flotsam is another problem , one faced by many seabirds . The amount of plastic in the seas has increased dramatically since the first record in the 1960s , coming from waste discarded by ships , offshore dumping , litter on beaches and waste washed to sea by rivers . It is impossible to digest and takes up space in the stomach or gizzard that should be used for food , or can cause an obstruction that starves the bird directly . Studies of birds in the North Pacific have shown that ingestion of plastics results in declining body weight and body condition . This plastic is sometimes regurgitated and fed to chicks ; a study of Laysan albatross chicks on Midway Atoll showed large amounts of ingested plastic in naturally dead chicks compared to healthy chicks killed in accidents . While not the direct cause of death , this plastic causes physiological stress and causes the chick to feel full during feedings , reducing its food intake and the chances of survival . 
 Scientists and conservationists ( most importantly BirdLife International and their partners , who run the Save the Albatross campaign ) are working with governments and fishermen to find solutions to the threats albatrosses face . Techniques such as setting longline bait at night , dyeing the bait blue , setting the bait underwater , increasing the amount of weight on lines and using bird scarers can all reduce the seabird bycatch . For example , a collaborative study between scientists and fishermen in New Zealand successfully tested an underwater setting device for longliners which set the lines below the reach of vulnerable albatross species . The use of some of these techniques in the Patagonian toothfish fishery in the Falkland Islands is thought to have reduced the number of black @-@ browed albatross taken by the fleet in the last 10 years . Conservationists have also worked on the field of island restoration , removing introduced species that threaten native wildlife , which protects albatrosses from introduced predators . 
 One important step towards protecting albatrosses and other seabirds is the 2001 treaty , the Agreement on the Conservation of Albatrosses and Petrels , which came into force in 2004 and has been ratified by thirteen countries , Argentina , Australia , Brazil , Chile , Ecuador , France , New Zealand , Norway , Peru , South Africa , Spain , the United Kingdom and Uruguay . The treaty requires these countries to take specific actions to reduce bycatch , pollution and to remove introduced species from nesting islands .

 Current thinking divides the albatrosses into four genera . The number of species is a matter of debate . The IUCN and BirdLife International recognise 22 extant species ( listed below ) , ITIS recognise 21 ( the 22 below minus T. <unk> ) , and one recent paper proposed a reduction to 13 ( indicated in parentheses below ) , comprising the traditional 14 species minus D. <unk> .

 = Marketing of Halo 3 = 
 The first @-@ person shooter video game Halo 3 was the focus of an extensive marketing campaign which began with the game 's developer , Bungie , announcing the game via a trailer at the Electronic Entertainment Expo in May 2006 . Microsoft , the game 's publisher , planned a five @-@ pronged marketing strategy to maximize sales and to appeal to casual and hard @-@ core gamers . Bungie produced trailers and video documentaries to promote the game , partnering with firms such as Digital Domain and Weta Workshop . Licensed products including action figures , toys , and Halo 3 @-@ branded soda were released in anticipation of the game ; the franchise utilized more than forty licensees to promote the game , and the advertising campaign ultimately cost more than $ 40 million . 
 While Halo 2 's release had set industry records , the mainstream press was not fully involved in covering the game ; part of Microsoft 's strategy was to fully involve casual readers and the press in the story . The saturation of advertising and promotions led Wired to state : " The release of Halo 3 this week was an event that stretched far beyond our little gaming world . Everyone from The New York Times to Mother Jones wanted to cover it . " 
 Released on September 25 , 2007 , Halo 3 became the biggest entertainment debut in history , earning more than $ 170 million in a few days and selling a record 3 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 copies in its first week of sales alone . Halo 3 's marketing won several awards , and was cited as evidence of the increasing mainstream popularity of games .

 <unk> West , a global group product manager from Microsoft , said at a marketing conference that Halo 3 's marketing team had a mandate from Microsoft executive Peter Moore : " Don 't screw up . " Much of the marketing organization was handled by Microsoft 's former corporate vice president of global marketing , Jeff Bell ( executive ) . A key challenge the team identified early on was that core gamers knew the game was coming out , but there was " a perception problem ... we wanted to invite people into the console and into Xbox 360 and to play Halo 3 as a mass @-@ market entertainment product , " according to product manager Chris Lee . Since Halo 3 was released as an Xbox 360 exclusive , part of the marketing push was to sell more Xbox consoles , which had encountered sluggish sales . 
 Microsoft planned advertising and promotions to appeal to both casual and hardcore gamers in a five @-@ pronged marketing strategy . The first stage was to kick off marketing via a television commercial . The second stage was a beta test of the game to drive preorders and press attention . The third stage was the start of an alternate reality game . The fourth phase was partner promotions , capped off with a final advertising campaign , titled " Believe " . 
 Though Microsoft used forms of viral marketing for promotion ( including the alternate reality game or ARG ) , the main focus of the company 's efforts was traditional media outlets . Because there already was interest in the title among the gaming community , Microsoft did not feel the need to run a social media campaign , instead banking on the gaming community to spread the word itself . The focus on traditional media would help expand the fan base beyond established gamers and convince the public that the game was a cultural milestone . To build public interest , Microsoft made public statements that Halo 3 would surpass media sales records , including the July 2007 record of $ 166 million set by the launch of Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows . 
 Microsoft 's target was to sell 1 @.@ 5 million copies of the game . Marketing research suggested that the " Halo faithful " could only be counted on to buy 75 % of that amount , meaning that 375 @,@ 000 copies would have to be sold to non @-@ fans . Thus marketing goals were to attract an audience beyond the Halo nation , and to break sales records ; in short , to " make Halo 3 a true cultural phenomenon " . The team upped their goals to not only selling the target number of copies , but making Halo 3 the biggest entertainment launch ever . 
 = = Promotional videos = = 
 A significant form of marketing was done by the release of videos . While Bungie often partnered with other companies to create advertisements , they also produced their own video documentaries , or " <unk> " , detailing the behind @-@ the @-@ scenes development of aspects of Halo 3 , including redesigning enemy Brutes , additions to multiplayer , and other game features . The first <unk> was released shortly after the game 's announcement and was a " making @-@ of " style video , while the final <unk> made its debut on September 20 , 2007 .
