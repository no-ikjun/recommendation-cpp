 Upon the Duke 's death from cancer in 1972 , the Duchess travelled to the United Kingdom to attend his funeral , staying at Buckingham Palace during her visit . The Duchess , increasingly frail and suffering from dementia , lived the remainder of her life as a recluse , supported by both her husband 's estate and an allowance from the Queen . She suffered several falls , and broke her hip twice . After her husband 's death , the Duchess 's French lawyer , Suzanne Blum , assumed power of attorney . Blum sold items belonging to the Duchess to her own friends at lower than market value , and was accused of exploiting her client in Caroline Blackwood 's The Last of the Duchess , written in 1980 , but not published until after Blum 's death in 1995 . Later royal biographer Hugo Vickers called Blum a " Satanic figure … wearing the mantle of good intention to disguise her inner malevolence " . In 1980 , the Duchess lost the power of speech . Toward the end , she was bedridden and did not receive any visitors , apart from her doctor and nurses . 
 The Duchess of Windsor died on 24 April 1986 at her home in the Bois de Boulogne , Paris . Her funeral was held at St George 's Chapel , Windsor Castle , attended by her two surviving sisters @-@ in @-@ law : the Queen Mother and Princess Alice , Duchess of Gloucester , and other members of the royal family . The Queen , Prince Philip , and the Prince and Princess of Wales attended both the funeral ceremony and the burial . She was buried next to Edward in the Royal Burial Ground near Windsor Castle , as " Wallis , Duchess of Windsor " . Until an agreement with Queen Elizabeth II in the 1960s , the Duke and Duchess had previously planned for a burial in a purchased cemetery plot at Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore , where the father of the Duchess was interred . 
 In recognition of the help France gave to the Duke and Duchess in providing them with a home , and in lieu of death duties , the Duchess 's collection of Louis XVI style furniture , some porcelain and paintings were made over to the French state . The British royal family received no major bequests . Most of her estate went to the Pasteur Institute medical research foundation , on the instructions of Suzanne Blum . The decision took the royal family and the Duchess 's friends by surprise , as she had shown little interest in charity during her life . In a Sotheby 's auction in Geneva in April 1987 the Duchess 's remarkable jewellery collection raised $ 45 million for the Institute , approximately seven times its pre @-@ sale estimate . Blum later claimed that Egyptian entrepreneur Mohamed Al @-@ Fayed tried to purchase the jewels for a " rock bottom price " . Al @-@ Fayed bought much of the non @-@ financial estate , including the lease of the Paris mansion . An auction of his collection was announced in July 1997 for later that year in New York . Delayed by his son 's death in the car accident that also claimed the life of Diana , Princess of Wales , the sale raised more than £ 14 million for charity in 1998 .

 Wallis was plagued by rumours of other lovers . The gay American playboy Jimmy Donahue , an heir to the Woolworth fortune , claimed to have had a liaison with the Duchess in the 1950s , but Donahue was notorious for his inventive pranks and rumour @-@ mongering . 
 Her memoirs , The Heart Has Its Reasons , were published in 1956 . Author Charles Higham said of the book , " facts were remorselessly rearranged in what amounted to a self @-@ performed face @-@ lift ... reflecting in abundance its author 's politically misguided but winning and desirable personality . " He describes the Duchess as " charismatic , electric and compulsively ambitious " . 
 The Daily Telegraph , in their obituary of Higham , said : " The themes of fascism , closet homosexuality and sexual perversion that had proved so productive in the case of Flynn were themes that Higham would mine again and again . That his motives were probably financial is suggested by his admission in an interview that there was ' certainly a difference of an enormous number of sales ' between his poetry books and his biographies . " 
 Hearsay and conjecture have clouded assessment of the Duchess of Windsor 's life , not helped by her own manipulation of the truth . But there is no document which proves directly that she was anything other than a victim of her own ambition , who lived out a great romance that became a great tragedy . In the opinion of her biographers , " she experienced the ultimate fairy tale , becoming the adored favourite of the most glamorous bachelor of his time . The idyll went wrong when , ignoring her pleas , he threw up his position to spend the rest of his life with her . " Academics agree that she ascended a precipice that " left her with fewer alternatives than she had anticipated . Somehow she thought that the Establishment could be overcome once [ Edward ] was king , and she confessed frankly to Aunt Bessie about her ' insatiable ambitions ' ... Trapped by his flight from responsibility into exactly the role she had sought , suddenly she warned him , in a letter , ' You and I can only create disaster together ' ... she predicted to society hostess Sibyl Colefax , ' two people will suffer ' because of ' the workings of a system ' ... Denied dignity , and without anything useful to do , the new Duke of Windsor and his Duchess would be international society 's most notorious parasites for a generation , while they thoroughly bored each other ... She had thought of him as emotionally a Peter Pan , and of herself an Alice in Wonderland . The book they had written together , however , was a Paradise Lost . " The Duchess herself is reported to have summed up her life in a sentence : " You have no idea how hard it is to live out a great romance . "

 Wallis has been portrayed by Faye Dunaway in The Woman I Love ( 1972 , TV drama ) , Cynthia Harris in Edward & Mrs. Simpson ( 1978 , TV miniseries ) , Barbara Parkins in To Catch a King ( 1983 , TV movie ) , Jane Seymour in The Woman He Loved ( 1988 , TV movie ) , Jane Hartley in Always ( 1997 , West End musical ) , Amber Sealey in Bertie and Elizabeth ( 2002 , TV movie ) , Joely Richardson in Wallis & Edward ( 2005 , TV movie ) , Gillian Anderson in Any Human Heart ( 2010 , TV mini @-@ series ) , Emma Clifford in Upstairs , Downstairs ( 2010 , TV mini @-@ series ) , Eve Best in The King 's Speech ( 2010 ) , and Andrea Riseborough in W.E. ( 2011 ) . 
 In his 1981 novel Famous Last Words , Canadian author Timothy Findley depicts the Duchess as a manipulative conspirator . A 2006 short story by Rose Tremain , called " The Darkness of Wallis Simpson " , depicts Wallis more sympathetically in her final years of ill health . Anne Edwards wrote another sympathetic account , of Wallis 's life up to the marriage to Edward , in her 1991 book Wallis : The Novel . Kate Auspitz 's 2010 novel , The War Memoirs of HRH Wallis , Duchess of Windsor , portrays Wallis as a tool of the Allies who employ her to knock fascist @-@ sympathising King Edward VIII off the throne .

This is the third time that the number has been used on a highway in Michigan ; the first two were used in the Berrien County and Pontiac areas . The Saginaw version was designated in 1971 , and it is listed on the National Highway System .

 M @-@ 58 starts at an intersection with M @-@ 47 ( Midland Road ) near the Tittabawassee River in Saginaw Township . It runs east on State Street through a commercial area in the township . Continuing east , the adjoining properties transition to residential buildings . Between Avalon and Lathrop avenues , M @-@ 58 splits into a one @-@ way pairing of streets : eastbound traffic continues along State Street , but westbound traffic uses Davenport Avenue , one block to the north . Just east of this split , M @-@ 58 crosses into the City of Saginaw . 
 In Saginaw , the two parallel streets continue east and meet M @-@ 84 which runs north – south along Bay Street . The distance between the two parallel streets decreases east of North Carolina Street when Davenport Avenue shifts to the south . The intersection with Hill Street marks the beginning of the connections to the exit 3 interchange along a bend in the I @-@ 675 freeway . Hill Street is one @-@ way carrying traffic southbound exiting from southbound I @-@ 675 to either direction of M @-@ 58 .

East of this intersection , State Street curves to the north , intersecting Davenport Avenue and merging into the ramp for southbound I @-@ 675 . A loop ramp across the freeway provides access from northbound I @-@ 675 to Davenport Avenue . This interchange complex marks the eastern terminus of M @-@ 58 . 
 M @-@ 58 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) like other state highways in Michigan .

 = Waterspout = 
 A waterspout is an intense columnar vortex ( usually appearing as a funnel @-@ shaped cloud ) that occurs over a body of water . They are connected to a towering cumuliform cloud or a cumulonimbus cloud . In the common form , it is a non @-@ supercell tornado over water . 
 While it is often weaker than most of its land counterparts , stronger versions spawned by mesocyclones do occur . Most waterspouts do not suck up water ; they are small and weak rotating columns of air over water . 
 While waterspouts form mostly in the tropics and subtropical areas , other areas also report waterspouts , including Europe , New Zealand , the Great Lakes and Antarctica . Although rare , waterspouts have been observed in connection with lake @-@ effect snow precipitation bands . 
 Waterspouts have a five @-@ part life cycle : formation of a dark spot on the water surface , spiral pattern on the water surface , formation of a spray ring , development of the visible condensation funnel , and ultimately decay . 
 = = Formation = = 
 Waterspouts exist on a microscale , where their environment is less than two kilometers in width . The cloud from which they develop can be as innocuous as a moderate cumulus , or as great as a supercell . While some waterspouts are strong and tornadic in nature , most are much weaker and caused by different atmospheric dynamics . They normally develop in moisture @-@ laden environments as their parent clouds are in the process of development , and it is theorized they spin as they move up the surface boundary from the horizontal shear near the surface , and then stretch upwards to the cloud once the low level shear vortex aligns with a developing cumulus cloud or thunderstorm . Weak tornadoes , known as landspouts , have been shown to develop in a similar manner . More than one waterspout can occur in the same vicinity at the same time . As many as nine simultaneous waterspouts have been reported on Lake Michigan . 
 = = Types = = 
 = = = Non @-@ tornadic = = = 
 Waterspouts that are not associated with a rotating updraft of a supercell thunderstorm are known as " non @-@ tornadic " or " fair @-@ weather waterspouts " , and are by far the most common type . Fair @-@ weather waterspouts occur in coastal waters and are associated with dark , flat @-@ bottomed , developing convective cumulus towers . Waterspouts of this type rapidly develop and dissipate , having life cycles shorter than 20 minutes . They usually rate no higher than EF0 on the Enhanced Fujita scale , generally exhibiting winds of less than 30 m / s ( 67 mph ) . 
 They are most frequently seen in tropical and sub @-@ tropical climates , with upwards of 400 per year observed in the Florida Keys . They typically move slowly , if at all , since the cloud to which they are attached is horizontally static , being formed by vertical convective action instead of the subduction / <unk> interaction between colliding fronts . Fair @-@ weather waterspouts are very similar in both appearance and mechanics to landspouts , and largely behave as such if they move ashore . 
 = = = Tornadic = = = 
 " Tornadic waterspouts " , also accurately referred to as " tornadoes over water " , are formed from mesocyclonic action in a manner essentially identical to traditional land @-@ based tornadoes in connection with severe thunderstorms , but simply occurring over water . A tornado which travels from land to a body of water would also be considered a tornadic waterspout . Since the vast majority of mesocyclonic thunderstorms occur in land @-@ locked areas of the United States , true tornadic waterspouts are correspondingly rarer than their fair @-@ weather counterparts in that country . However , in some areas , such as the Adriatic , Aegean and Ionian seas , tornadic waterspouts can make up half of the total number . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 A winter waterspout , also known as a snow devil , an <unk> , an ice devil , a <unk> , or a <unk> , is an extremely rare instance of a waterspout forming under the base of a snow squall . The term " winter waterspout " is used to differentiate between the common warm season waterspout and this rare winter season event . Very little is known about this phenomenon and only six known pictures of this event exist to date , four of which were taken in Ontario , Canada . There are a couple of critical criteria for the formation of a winter waterspout . Very cold temperatures need to be present over a body of water warm enough to produce fog resembling steam above the water 's surface . Like the more efficient lake @-@ effect snow events , winds focusing down the axis of long lakes enhance wind convergence and likely enhance their development . 
 = = Climatology = = 
 Though the majority occur in the tropics , they can seasonally appear in temperate areas throughout the world , and are common across the western coast of Europe as well as the British Isles and several areas of the Mediterranean and Baltic Sea . They are not restricted to saltwater ; many have been reported on lakes and rivers including the Great Lakes and the St. Lawrence River . Waterspouts are fairly common on the Great Lakes during late summer and early fall , with a record 66 + waterspouts reported over just a seven @-@ day period in 2003 . They are more frequent within 100 kilometers ( 60 mi ) from the coast than farther out at sea . Waterspouts are common along the southeast U.S. coast , especially off southern Florida and the Keys and can happen over seas , bays , and lakes worldwide . Approximately 160 waterspouts are currently reported per year across Europe , with the Netherlands reporting the most at 60 , followed by Spain and Italy at 25 , and the United Kingdom at 15 . They are most common in late summer . In the Northern Hemisphere , September has been pinpointed as the prime month of formation . Waterspouts are frequently observed off the east coast of Australia , with several being described by Joseph Banks during the voyage of the Endeavour in 1770 . 
 = = Life cycle = = 
 There are five stages to the waterspout life cycle . Initially , a prominent circular , light @-@ colored disk appears on the surface of the water , surrounded by a larger dark area of indeterminate shape . After the formation of these colored disks on the water , a pattern of light and dark @-@ colored spiral bands develop from the dark spot on the water surface . Then , a dense annulus of sea spray , called a cascade , appears around the dark spot with what appears to be an eye . Eventually , the waterspout becomes a visible funnel from the water surface to the overhead cloud . The spray vortex can rise to a height of several hundred feet or more and often creates a visible wake and an associated wave train as it moves . Eventually , the funnel and spray vortex begin to dissipate as the inflow of warm air into the vortex weakens , ending the waterspout 's life cycle . 
 = = Nautical threat = = 
 Waterspouts have long been recognized as serious marine hazards . Stronger waterspouts pose threats to watercraft , aircraft and people . It is recommended to keep a considerable distance from these phenomena , and to always be on alert through weather reports . The United States National Weather Service will often issue special marine warnings when waterspouts are likely or have been sighted over coastal waters , or tornado warnings when waterspouts are expected to move onshore . 
 Incidents of waterspouts causing severe damage and casualties are rare . However , there have been several notable examples . The Malta tornado in 1555 was the earliest record of a deadly waterspout . It struck the Grand Harbour of Valletta , sinking four galleys , numerous boats , and claiming hundreds of lives . The 1851 Sicily Tornadoes were twin waterspouts that made landfall in western Sicily , ravaging the coast and countryside before ultimately dissipating back again over the sea . 
 = = Animal threat = = 
 Depending on how fast the winds from a waterspout are whipping , anything that is within about one yard of the surface of the water , including fish of different sizes , frogs , and even turtles , can be lifted into the air . A waterspout can sometimes suck small animals such as fish out of the water and all the way up into the cloud . Even if the waterspout stops spinning , the fish in the cloud can be carried over land , buffeted up and down and around with the cloud ’ s winds until its currents no longer keep the flying fish in the atmosphere . Depending on how far they travel and how high they are taken into the atmosphere , the fish are sometimes dead by the time they rain down . People as far as 100 miles inland have experienced raining fish . Fish can also be sucked up from rivers , but raining fish is not a common weather phenomenon

 The Szilagyi Waterspout Index ( SWI ) , developed by Canadian meteorologist Wade Szilagyi , is used to predict conditions favorable for waterspout development . The SWI ranges from − 10 to + 10 , where values greater than or equal to zero represent conditions favorable for waterspout development .

 The ICWR is a non governmental organization of individuals from around the world who are interested in the field of waterspouts from a research , operational and safety perspective .

 = Big Four ( tennis ) = 
 In tennis , the term Big Four refers to the quartet of men 's singles players Roger Federer , Rafael Nadal , Novak Djokovic , and Andy Murray . They reigned as the four best players in the world every season from 2008 – 2016 . These players were considered dominant in terms of ranking and tournament victories , including Grand Slam tournaments and ATP Masters 1000 events , as well as the ATP World Tour Finals and Olympic Games . 
 Federer was the first to come to prominence after winning Wimbledon in 2003 and established himself as the world No. 1 by the beginning of 2004 . Nadal followed in 2005 after a French Open triumph including a win over Federer , and they occupied the top two places in the ATP rankings for 211 consecutive weeks from July 2005 to August 2009 . Djokovic , from 2007 , and later Murray , from 2009 , increasingly challenged Federer 's and Nadal 's dominance with seasonal consistency : Djokovic captured three of the four major tournaments in 2011 , and in 2012 the quartet won one Major tournament apiece . In 2011 , Nadal declared that his and Federer 's period of joint dominance had ended , owing to the ascent of other players , notably Djokovic and Murray . 
 Since this time the term " Big Four " , while used previously , became popular with the media and in tennis literature . The Big Four were a critical part of what has , since 2010 , often been labelled a new " Golden Era " in tennis ; that term is also applied to the mid @-@ 1970s to 1980s , and the 1920s to the 1930s . 
 Between them , they have won 42 of the last 46 men 's major singles titles , from the 2005 French Open through to the 2016 Wimbledon Championships ( the only times they haven 't won being at the 2009 US Open , the 2014 Australian Open , the 2014 US Open and the 2015 French Open ) ; they have also won 11 of the previous 13 World Tour Finals ( previously Tennis Masters Cup ) , with Federer winning six and Djokovic winning five , with a record 4 consecutive from 2012 to 2015 . They have regularly occupied the top four places in the year @-@ end rankings between 2008 and 2013 , with Murray being the only member not to have been ranked world No. 1 , having reached a career high No. 2 on several occasions . Of the four , Federer leads with a record 17 Grand Slam tournament titles followed by Nadal ( 14 ) , Djokovic ( 12 ) and Murray ( 3 ) . Federer , Nadal , and Djokovic have completed a Career Grand Slam by winning each of the four Majors at least once , with Nadal also winning a gold medal at 2008 Summer Olympics for a Career Golden Slam . Murray has won neither the French Open nor the Australian Open , despite reaching the final five times in Melbourne and once in Paris , but won the gold medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics . 
 Furthermore , at ATP Masters 1000 tournaments , they are all in historic top 10 list , Djokovic leads with a record 29 titles , Nadal ( 28 ) , Federer ( 24 ) , and Murray ( 12 ) . All four players have also played key roles in leading their countries to success in the Davis Cup , including in Djokovic 's and Federer 's case with Serbia ( 2010 ) and Switzerland ( 2014 ) winning the competition for the first time , while Nadal has racked up four Davis Cup titles , and in Murray 's case , ending a drought of 79 years for Great Britain in 2015 .

 The early 2000s were seen as a time of transition in tennis , with older players retiring and a few players breaking through at the very top of the game . Roger Federer had first played on the ATP Tour aged 17 in 1998 , finishing his first full ATP season the following year before finishing 2002 ranked sixth in the world , his first year @-@ end ranking in the top 8 . His breakthrough came in 2003 when he won his first Grand Slam tournament , and finished the year as world number 2 behind Andy Roddick . The following two years he had almost complete solo dominance , winning five of eight majors and losing just ten matches in 2004 and 2005 . 
 Nadal had won his first ATP Tour match aged 15 years and 10 months in April 2002 , and he defeated Federer in their first meeting in 2004 at Miami . 2005 was Nadal 's breakthrough year , in which he won 24 consecutive matches on clay , including his first French Open beating Federer en route in the semifinals , and he finished as world number 2 while Federer remained number 1 for a second straight year . 
 The period between 2005 and 2008 was subsequently dominated by the Federer – Nadal rivalry . They won 11 consecutive majors , meeting in every French Open and Wimbledon final from 2006 – 2008 . The 2008 Wimbledon final , which Nadal won , has been lauded as the greatest match ever by many long @-@ time tennis analysts . From 2005 – 2010 they ended every year as the world 's top two players . 
 = = = = Djokovic and Murray = = = = 
 Novak Djokovic and Andy Murray were born a week apart , played each other as juniors and made their Grand Slam tournament debuts in 2005 . Djokovic made his ATP tour debut in 2004 , while Murray 's was in 2005 , a time when many bright youngsters joined the ATP tour . They both reached the world top 100 in 2005 , and the world top 20 in 2006 . Djokovic , however , began to excel ahead of Murray , reaching one major final and two semifinals in 2007 and began to challenge Federer and Nadal regularly . He also won two Masters tournament titles and 5 titles in total , finishing the year ranked number 3 in world . Murray , who was forced out of the French Open and Wimbledon by injury , ended 2007 ranked 11th , winning two ATP tournaments . 
 = = = 2008 – 2010 : Emergence of the Big Four = = = 
 Between 2008 and 2010 , Novak Djokovic and later Andy Murray attempted to end the duopoly of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal at the summit of tennis . They did not break it but emerged ahead of the rest of the tour . At the 2008 Australian Open , Novak Djokovic defeated Roger Federer in the semifinals , reaching his first Australian Open final and ending Federer 's streak of ten consecutive Major finals , continuing his fine form at the end of the 2007 season which saw him reach his first major final . Djokovic went on to defeat Jo @-@ Wilfried Tsonga ( who had eliminated Nadal in the semifinal ) to win his first Major . Following his Australian Open win , Djokovic emerged as a clear world number three during the year , holding the ranking throughout 2008 . Meanwhile , Andy Murray continued to rise in the rankings , reaching his first Major quarterfinal at Wimbledon , losing to Nadal . He also won his first two Masters titles . 
 Federer and Nadal remained the lead rivalry , and the pair met in the final of both the French Open and Wimbledon . Nadal won both , with the latter described as one of the greatest tennis matches of all time . In August 2008 , after winning the 2008 Summer Olympics gold medal , Nadal passed Federer to become world No. 1 , after Federer had been at the top for a record 237 consecutive weeks . 
 The year 's final Major , the US Open , saw all four players reach the semifinals of the same Major for the first time . Federer defeated Djokovic in the semifinals , while Murray won through to his first Grand Slam tournament final after upsetting the top @-@ ranked Nadal in four sets . Federer then defeated Murray in the final to win his fifth consecutive US Open title , and win his 13th Major title overall . Following the US Open , Murray entered the top four in the ATP rankings for the first time and all four players qualified for the 2008 Tennis Masters Cup , which Djokovic won . Despite having to withdraw from this event through injury , Nadal ended the year ranked world No. 1 , ahead of Federer and Djokovic with Murray respectively finishing fourth due to his run at the US Open . 
 In 2009 , the Big Four held the top four places in the rankings for a whole calendar year for the first time . This also prompted the first uses of the term ' Big Four ' to refer to the players , although results saw Nadal and Federer generally remain clear leaders ahead of Djokovic and Murray who they themselves were still regarded ahead of the rest of the tour . At the Australian Open , Nadal won his first Australian Open title in another 5 @-@ set epic , obtaining a third consecutive Major final victory over Federer , while Murray and Djokovic were eliminated earlier on . Nadal continued to dominate early in the season , but suffered from injury in June , allowing Federer to take the upper hand for the rest of the season . Federer subsequently passed the record for most Grand Slam tournament wins , taking his 14th Grand Slam title at the French Open , thus completing the Career Grand Slam after Nadal had prevented him from achieving this feat at the previous 4 French Open tournaments , and 15th title at Wimbledon respectively . Federer finished the season having reached all four Major finals for the third time in his career following 2006 and 2007 . 
 Following Nadal 's injuries , Murray and Djokovic made up further grounds in the rankings , although neither of them were able to make a Major final in 2009 . In particular , their consistency at Masters level tournaments kept them in the top four of the rankings , with Murray reaching world No. 2 in August , and ending the 211 @-@ week reign of Roger Federer and Rafael Nadal as the top two players of the world in the process . His reign as the world No. 2 would not last long , as he was upset in the fourth round of the US Open by Croat Marin Čilić . There , Djokovic reached his first Grand Slam tournament semifinal of 2009 , losing in straight sets to Federer while Nadal was defeated by eventual winner Juan Martín del Potro in the semifinal . Between 2005 Australian Open and 2014 Australian Open , this was the only Grand Slam event not won by a member of the Big Four . ( Since then , Wawrinka won the 2014 Australian Open and 2015 French Open while Čilić won the 2014 US Open ) . 
 At the end of 2009 Federer , Nadal , Djokovic and Murray finished as the ATP 's top four players for the second consecutive year with only Nadal and Federer changing positions from the 2008 final rankings list . 
 During the 2010 season , the Big Four began to dominate the Tour as a group for the first time . The Big Four provided six of the eight Grand Slam tournament finalists , and won 14 tournaments combined in the season ( compared to 6 for the other four competitors at the 2010 ATP World Tour Finals ) . At the start of the year , Federer continued his dominance as world number one by winning the Australian Open , defeating Murray in the final however his run of 23 consecutive Grand Slam semi @-@ finals came to end at the French Open that year losing to Robin Söderling in 4 sets , he also then lost to Tomáš Berdych at Wimbledon ending his run of 7 consecutive Wimbledon finals . Nadal dominated the clay @-@ court season again , winning all three clay @-@ court Masters events and the French Open . Nadal also won at Wimbledon , although in both of these tournaments he only had to face one other member of the Big Four ( Murray in the Wimbledon semi @-@ finals ) . 
 At the US Open , Djokovic beat Federer to reach his third Major final , although Nadal won once again to complete his Career Grand Slam . In November , Robin Söderling ( who has reached the French Open final ) briefly passed Murray to reach fourth place in the ATP rankings , threatening to break the Big Four 's run of filling the end @-@ of @-@ year rankings . However , all of the Big Four reached the 2010 ATP World Tour Finals semifinals with Federer defeating Nadal in 3 sets in the final , leading to them achieving their third successive season in the top 4 positions . Again Djokovic and Murray were third and fourth respectively , both reaching one Grand Slam tournament final apiece . 
 = = = 2011 to 2013 : Dominance = = = 
 The 2011 season was dominated by Novak Djokovic . Djokovic won 10 titles in total , including three Grand Slam tournament titles ( only the fifth man in the open era to do so ) and five ATP Masters 1000 titles ( a record ) , enjoyed a 41 match winning streak ( ended by Federer in the semifinals of the 2011 French Open ) , amassed a record in prize money , and ascended to world No. 1 in the world for the first time in July . The season was described by many experts and former players as one of the best tennis seasons for a single player seen in history , with Tennis Magazine describing it as the third best tennis season ever , behind Roger Federer 's 2006 season , and Rod Laver 's in 1969 . Pete Sampras described it as " one of the best achievements in all of sport . " 
 Djokovic 's dominance contributed to an overall control by the Big Four . They all reached the semifinals at two of the year 's Grand Slam events , and between them won every Masters tournament . Nadal was a clear second place behind Djokovic , winning the French Open and losing in both the Wimbledon and US Open final . Nadal ended the season with a 0 – 6 losing record against Djokovic : every match they played was a championship final . 
 By his standards , Roger Federer had a weak season : he failed to win a Grand Slam tournament title for the first time since 2002 , losing to Nadal for the fourth time in a French Open final , and the sixth time overall in Major finals . He dropped to world No. 4 in November , the first time he had been ranked outside the top 3 since 2002 . Federer 's drop was caused by Murray 's remarkable run of form in Asia in October , winning three successive titles . However , Federer rallied , winning his three final tournaments ( a sign of things to come in the subsequent season ) , including the World Tour Finals , which was enough to secure an end @-@ of @-@ season ranking of No. 3 . Murray , meanwhile , was making significant improvements to his game and made the semifinals of all four Grand Slam tournaments , with his best result a defeat in the Australian Open final by Djokovic . He ended the year with two ATP World Tour Masters 1000 titles for the fourth consecutive year , and five titles in total . 
 The dominance of the Big Four continued in 2012 . Each player won one Grand Slam tournament : Djokovic won in Australia , Nadal in France , Federer at Wimbledon and Murray ( who hired former world number 1 Ivan Lendl as his head coach earlier in the year ) with his first Grand Slam tournament title at the US Open . This win " cemented " Murray 's position – who also won gold in the Olympic Games – as a member of the Big Four : his end of season ranking of third was his best yet . Djokovic entered the season as world number 1 , and remained there until July 2012 , when he was overtaken by Federer , who reclaimed the top spot for the first time since June 2010 . Federer subsequently overtook Sampras ' record of 286 weeks at the top , and ultimately extended the record to 302 weeks . Federer relinquished his world No. 1 ranking on 5 November , Djokovic reclaiming the top spot and ending the year at the top of the rankings for the second consecutive year . Djokovic was the only player to make at least the semifinals in all four Grand Slam events , and was the losing finalist at the French and US Open . Both he and Federer won three Masters tournaments , seeing them dominate the season as a whole . Federer was also the silver medalist at the Olympics , where Djokovic finished fourth . Nadal , meanwhile , had his season cut short by an injury . Having won two clay court Masters tournaments and the French Open , he was eliminated in the second round at Wimbledon – his first defeat at such an early stage in a Grand Slam tournament since 2005 . He later revealed that he had been injured going into the tournament , and he did not compete for the rest of the season , but still ended the year as world No. 4 . 
 The 2013 season continued in similar fashion , with Djokovic , Federer and Murray occupying three of the four semifinal slots at the Australian Open , with Nadal still suffering from injury . Murray beat Federer in a five @-@ set epic in the semifinal meaning all four members of the Big Four had beaten each other at least once in a Grand Slam event , subsequently losing to Djokovic in the final in four sets . As a result , Djokovic became the third man to win four Australian Open titles and the first to win three consecutively . Murray himself becoming the first man to reach the final of the next Grand Slam event after winning their maiden title . Nadal returned for the clay @-@ court season , winning events in Rome , Barcelona , Madrid before becoming the only male player to win a Grand Slam tournament eight times by winning the French Open , defeating Djokovic in the semifinals . However , Djokovic did end Nadal 's eight @-@ year winning streak at the Monte @-@ Carlo Masters . Murray 's clay @-@ court season ended prematurely because of a back injury and did not compete at the French Open , whereas Federer lost in the quarterfinals after making the final in Rome . Nadal and Federer lost early at Wimbledon in the first and second round respectively , thus ending Federer 's 36 consecutive Grand Slam tournament quarter final appearance record . Murray defeated Djokovic in the final to become the first British man to win the tournament in 77 years , extending his winning streak on grass to 18 matches . Leading up to the US Open , Nadal won ATP Masters 1000 events in Montreal and Cincinnati , his third hardcourt ATP Masters 1000 event of the year after winning at Indian Wells earlier in the year , extending his winning streak to 15 – 0 on <unk> for the year . He went on to win the US Open , defeating Djokovic in the final in four sets . While Murray and Federer lost early , in the quarterfinals and fourth round respectively . 
 Overall , the season was about Nadal and Djokovic . Nadal won two Majors and five ATP Masters 1000 events . He was also runner @-@ up at the ATP World Tour Finals . Djokovic won one Major , and reached two finals and a semifinal in the other three , and finished the year strongly on a 22 @-@ match winning streak , winning the ATP World Tour Finals in London . The 2013 head @-@ to @-@ head record of Nadal and Djokovic was tied at 3 – 3 . A back injury ended Murray 's season prematurely and he finished fourth in the rankings , but was the only player besides Nadal and Djokovic to win a Grand Slam tournament or ATP Masters 1000 title , at Wimbledon and Miami respectively . Federer suffered his worst season for a decade . He reached just one Major semifinal , failed to win a single ATP Masters 1000 crown and finished the year sixth in the rankings with one title to his name , though he too suffered from a recurring back injury throughout the season .

 As 2013 came to a close , Roger Federer 's fall in the rankings prompted many sources to debate whether or not the status of the Big Four had ended . This debate intensified in the wake of the Australian Open , which saw Stan Wawrinka defeat Djokovic in the quarter @-@ final and Nadal in the final to win his first Slam title , marking just the second time since 2005 and the first since 2009 that a player outside the Big Four had won a Grand Slam tournament . Murray and Federer fell to sixth and eighth in the rankings respectively , and after the tournament , several players expressed the opinion that they were now capable of challenging the Big Four . However , the Big Four occupied all four final spots of the first two Masters 1000 titles of the year in Indian Wells and Miami , with Djokovic winning his fourth and fifth consecutive Masters titles with tight victories over Federer and Nadal respectively . 
 The clay @-@ court season started with Wawrinka winning his first ATP Masters 1000 title in Monte @-@ Carlo , coming from behind to defeat Federer in the final . Nadal had failed to reach the final in Monte @-@ Carlo for the first time since 2004 , and also lost his first match at Barcelona since 2003 , against Nicolas Almagro . A third loss , to Djokovic in the final of the Rome Masters , was the first time Nadal had lost more than two matches on clay in a season for a decade . He did , however , win the Madrid Masters , and went on to defend his French Open title , defeating Murray in the semi @-@ final and Djokovic in the final , with Federer losing in the fourth round to Ernests Gulbis – the third time in his last four Grand Slam event appearances he failed to make the quarterfinals . 
 Following his back surgery at the end of 2013 , Murray had struggled to return to form in the first half of the year , reaching only two semi @-@ finals and losing to Grigor Dimitrov in straight sets in the quarter @-@ finals while attempting to defend his Wimbledon title , a defeat which saw him fall to no . 10 in the world rankings . This , and Nadal 's loss to Nick Kyrgios in the fourth round , his third consecutive early @-@ round loss at Wimbledon , led former players and experts , including Jimmy Connors , to express the opinion that the " aura " around the Big Four had faded . Milos Raonic , who reached the semi @-@ finals at Wimbledon , suggested there was now a " human side " visible in the Big Four , which was giving players belief when facing them . However , Djokovic defeated Dimitrov and Federer beat Raonic to make it an all @-@ Big Four final , the 24th they have contested . Djokovic defeated Federer in five sets to claim his second Wimbledon title , a result that left Djokovic , Nadal and Federer occupying the top three places in the rankings . 
 At the Rogers Cup , Frenchman Jo @-@ Wilfried Tsonga defeated Djokovic and Murray in the third round and quarter @-@ finals respectively before defeating Federer in the final . Federer continued his return to form , winning his first Masters title since 2012 in Cincinnati . Later , he also won the Shanghai Masters , and returned to No. 2 in the rankings , overtaking Nadal , whose season had been curtailed by a wrist injury . 
 The US Open 2014 saw the Big Four 's collective grip on the major titles slip still further , however , as Kei Nishikori and Marin <unk> beat Djokovic and Federer in the semi @-@ finals respectively to contest the first Slam final featuring none of the Big Four since the 2005 Australian Open , and the first time since 2003 that multiple first @-@ time Grand Slam tournament winners have been crowned in a single season . Following the tournament , Murray dropped to 11th in the rankings , his first time outside the top 10 since 2008 . The tournament as a whole further signalled the decline of the Big Four 's dominance . Towards the end of the year , Andy Murray managed to return to form , winning three titles in Shenzhen , Vienna and Valencia , allowing him to return to the top ten in the rankings and qualify for the Tour Finals , but he bowed out at the group stages following a humiliating defeat by Federer , in which he won just a single game . Indeed , throughout the year Murray failed to register a single victory against another member of the Big Four in nine meetings . 
 The 2014 season drew to a close with Djokovic winning the China Open title , extending his record at the event to 24 – 0 , and the Paris Masters title . At the tour finals Federer and Djokovic both reached the final , but Federer withdrew citing injury following a brutal semifinal against Wawrinka . Federer recovered to win the Davis Cup as part of the Switzerland team for his , and the country 's , first triumph in the competition , leading many people to say that his tennis career was now complete . Collectively , the Big Four won 19 titles in 2014 , but two Slam titles and two Masters titles went to other players . In the end @-@ of @-@ year rankings , Djokovic , Federer and Nadal held the top three spots , with Murray in sixth . 
 Following Murray 's strong end to 2014 and reaching the final of the 2015 Australian Open , he moved into the top four in the ATP rankings for the first time in over year , meaning that the Big Four held the top four places in the rankings for the first time since early 2013 , slowing the idea of the regression of the quartet . However , Federer and Nadal both lost early in the third round and quarterfinals respectively , the first time in 12 appearances that Federer had lost before the semi @-@ finals at the first Slam of the season . Djokovic won the title , as well as well as the first three Masters titles of the year in Indian Wells ( where the Big Four were the top four seeds in ATP Masters 1000 event for the time since 2012 ) , Miami and Monte @-@ Carlo , defeating Murray in the final in Miami ( his seventh straight victory against the Brit ) and Federer in the final of Indian Wells respectively . With these victories , Djokovic became the only man to win the Indian Wells @-@ Miami sweep on three separate occasions . 
 Andy Murray 's strong form continued and on his return in the clay @-@ court season he won his first title on a clay court in Munich . Then , in the Madrid Open , he defeated Milos Raonic and Kei Nishikori to reach the final , where he defeated Nadal in straight sets to win his first Masters title on clay and first since 2013 . This was also the first time he had beaten another member of the Big Four in a Tour match since his victory in the final at Wimbledon 2013 , going into the match 0 – 12 against the other members . The defeat saw Nadal slip to seventh in the rankings , his first time outside the Top 5 for more than a decade . Djokovic , returning after skipping Madrid , again defeated Federer in the final for his fourth Masters title of the year in Rome . Nadal suffered his worst European clay @-@ court season in a decade , failing to win a single title and appearing in just one final , whereas Djokovic and Murray entered the second Grand Slam event of the year unbeaten on clay . 
 Murray continued his clay court form during the French Open , defeating David Ferrer in the quarter @-@ finals to set up a semifinal against Djokovic , who had defeated Nadal in straight sets in the opposing quarter . This was only Nadal 's second defeat at the French Open , seeing him drop to No. 10 in the rankings , while Federer had been knocked out by fellow Swiss Stan Wawrinka in the quarter @-@ final held the previous day . Djokovic emerged victorious over Murray in a five set match that was spread over two days but succumbed to Wawrinka in the final in four sets , Wawrinka 's second Slam title in two years . 
 As the grass court season began , Nadal 's inconsistent form continued , as he won the title in Stuttgart before losing in the first round of Queen 's the following week and in the second round at the Wimbledon championships two weeks later . Murray went on to win Queen 's for a record @-@ tying fourth time , whilst Federer went on to win an eighth title in Halle . They both reached the semifinals of Wimbledon with Federer emerging victorious over Murray in straight sets . Djokovic claimed the other spot in the final , seeing off Kevin Anderson in five sets in the fourth round along the way , to set up a rematch of the previous year 's final , and defeated Federer in four sets to win his second grand slam of the year , denying Federer a record eighth Wimbledon title for the second year in a row . 
 Murray and Federer shared the two North American Hard Court Masters titles , at Montreal and Cincinnati respectively , with Djokovic being the losing finalist on both occasions . Murray 's victory over Djokovic in the Montreal final was his first in 2015 and followed eight successive losses against the Serb , and briefly saw him return to the No. 2 ranking , before Federer reclaimed the No. 2 position the following week , having defeated Murray in the semi @-@ finals . Nadal meanwhile was defeated at the quarter @-@ finals in Montreal and the third round in Cincinnati , and also suffered an early exit at the US Open . Murray was beaten by Kevin Anderson in the fourth round , his earliest defeat at a slam tournament since the 2010 US Open , but the final was contested by Djokovic and Federer . Djokovic won in four sets , giving him a third slam title of the season . Murray led Great Britain to Davis Cup victory in 2015 , winning all eight of a possible eight singles rubbers and becoming the latest member of the quartet to win the Davis Cup . 
 = = = 2016 = = = 
 In 2016 Djokovic collected his sixth Australian Open title in a straight sets victory over Murray . He followed up this solid run of form with a record setting fifth Indian Wells and record equaling sixth Miami masters titles . 
 At the 2016 French Open , Djokovic again beat Murray in the final to become the third Big Four member after Federer and Nadal to complete a Career Grand Slam . 
 Nadal withdrew from that year 's Wimbledon with a damaged wrist tendon , while a shock defeat for Novak Djokovic in the third round at the hands of the American Sam Querrey in four sets meant that only two of the Big Four were present in the tournament 's quarter @-@ finals ; Federer and Murray . Federer lost his semifinal to Milos Raonic in five sets . In the final Murray beat Raonic in straight sets to win his second Wimbledon title , and third Grand Slam title overall . Murray 's victory marked the first time since the 2010 French Open that a member of the Big Four had won a Grand Slam title without having to defeat one of the other three members . 
 Federer withdrew from the remainder of the 2016 season due to a knee injury , missing the 2016 Olympics and 2016 US Open .

 Since the 2005 Australian Open , the opening Grand Slam tournament of the 2005 ATP Tour , the Big Four have won both Olympic Games singles <unk> all but four Majors , and all but two Tennis Masters Cups / ATP World Tour Finals . 
 The dominance does not just consist of winning the events either , with all four members regularly making it to the latter stages of the tournament . Since 2010 they have occupied all but 4 finalist spots . Since 2008 they have occupied all four semifinal spots on four occasions , at the 2008 US Open , 2011 French Open , 2011 US Open & 2012 Australian Open , as well as taking three of the four spaces on nine other separate occasions . In 2011 they occupied 14 out of a possible 16 Grand Slam semifinal slots . In the same period , only twice have two or more not made the semifinal stage ( 2009 & 2010 French Open ) , while in 2012 they took 13 out 16 Grand Slam tournament semifinal slots . At the Olympics , members of the Big Four took two of the three available singles medals in 2008 and 2012 , and including doubles have a total of three golds , two silvers and a bronze from these games . Federer and Murray are the only members of the Big Four to have two Olympic medals , and Murray is the only one to have won two medals at the same tournament , taking both the singles ' gold medal and the mixed doubles ' silver medal at the 2012 Summer Olympics . Djokovic is the only member to not have won a gold medal in any event so far , having taken the singles ' bronze medal in 2008 . 
 The Big Four , along with Rod Laver , Tony Roche and Ivan Lendl , are the only men in Open Era history to reach the semifinals at all four Majors in a single calendar year , Federer has achieved this a record 5 times in his career so far and Djokovic four times . However , this feat has been accomplished many more times in the pre @-@ Open Era . Similarly , the Big Four make up four of the ten players to have made the semi @-@ finals twice or more at each of the four Grand Slam events .

 Similarly , ATP Masters / ATP Masters 1000 events have been dominated by the Big Four . Djokovic leads with a record 29 titles followed by Nadal ( 28 ) , Federer ( 24 ) , and Murray ( 12 ) . Since 2005 , spanning 104 events , they have won 89 , since 2007 of the 85 they 've won 72 , since 2009 of the 68 events that have taken place , they 've won 61 and since 2011 of the 50 events that have taken place , they 've won 47 . This includes all 9 in 2011 , 2013 and 2015 . Moreover , between the 2010 Paris Masters and 2012 Paris Masters , they won 17 consecutive ATP Masters 1000 events . As of the 2013 Rome Masters , they had won 109 titles from 121 finals at all levels of the ATP Tour since the start of the 2008 season . Since the tournaments were revamped and renamed ATP World Tour Masters 1000 events at the beginning of 2009 , no player outside the Big Four has won more than one title . 
 Of these ATP Masters events , excluding the Paris Masters ( where the Big Four have had less success , although they have still won it five times in the last seven years ) they have won : 
 All but one Indian Wells Masters events since ( and including ) 2004 . 
 All but two Miami Masters events since ( and including ) 2005 .

 The four Grand Slam tournaments , the ATP World Tour Finals , nine ATP Masters 1000s and the Summer Olympics , make up the 15 most coveted top @-@ level tournaments in men 's tennis . Although no player has won each of these 15 events in men 's singles , this feat has been achieved in men 's doubles by Canada 's Daniel Nestor and the United States ' Bryan Brothers , Bob Bryan and Mike Bryan . Djokovic matches the result in men 's singles of Andre Agassi , who ended his career having won 13 of these 15 events , achieving a Career Grand Slam ( winning all four Majors in a career ) , a Career Golden Slam ( winning all four Majors and the Olympic singles gold medal in a career ) , and what Sports Illustrated called a Career Super Slam ( winning all four Majors , the Olympic singles gold medal , and the ATP World Tour Finals ) . 
 Federer and Nadal are one behind Djokovic , and within three of matching this feat of winning all 15 . Nadal has also achieved a Career Grand Slam and a Career Golden Slam , but has thus far fallen short of winning the Tour Finals , and the Miami Open and Paris Masters . Federer has also achieved a Career Grand Slam , but is missing the Olympic Gold in singles , and the Monte @-@ Carlo Masters and Italian Open . Djokovic , as the only man to have won eight of the nine Masters events , is just a Cincinnati title away from achieving what has been labelled the Career Golden Masters , as well as needing the Olympic Gold to complete his overall tally . Murray , for his part , is still only about two @-@ thirds of the way to the goal having won 9 of the 15 events .

 Jo @-@ Wilfried Tsonga ( def . Djokovic in the round of 16 , Murray in the quarterfinals , and Federer in the finals to win the 2014 Canada Masters ) 
 The Big Four have played in 99 tournaments where all four have competed . Collectively they have won 87 of these 99 tournaments ( 88 % ) . Of the 12 tournaments they failed to win , they were runner @-@ up in 6 of them , and 5 of these 12 tournaments occurred prior to them first being seeded as the Top 4 players ( post @-@ US Open 2008 ) . Since this time in 2008 , the Big Four have won 58 of 65 tournaments ( 89 % ) . And starting with the 2010 Rome Masters , they had won 31 consecutive tournaments where all four were present , until the 2014 Australian Open . 
 Only seven players have managed to win a tournament where all four of the Big Four have competed : 
 Andy Roddick ( 2006 Cincinnati Masters , 2008 Dubai Tennis Championships , 2010 Miami Masters )

 The Big Four 's dominance ratio is also high when only three of the Big Four have competed in the same tournament . Of the 48 events where this has occurred , they have won 42 of them ( 88 % ) . Since 2008 , they have won 31 of 36 tournaments ( 86 % ) . 
 Only six players have managed to win a tournament where three of the Big Four have competed :

 Jo @-@ Wilfried Tsonga ( 2014 Canada Masters ) 
 Marin Čilić ( 2014 US Open ) 
 The Big Four 's dominance record diminishes when only two of them have competed in an event , but overall they still have a 70 % success rate , winning 44 of the 63 tournaments in this category , and a success rate of 81 % , winning 26 of 32 tournaments , since 2008 . 
 As for tournaments where only one of the Big Four has competed , this is the only category where the rest of the field has a positive ratio , winning 186 of the 262 tournaments ( 71 % ) played overall . However , it must be noted that this includes many tournaments played early on in each of the Big Four 's careers when they were still unseeded or seeded in double digits . Since their debut as the Top 4 seeds in late 2008 , the Big Four have won 31 of the 60 tournaments ( 52 % ) where just one of them has competed . 
 Only 14 players have recorded at least one victory over each member of the Big Four . Of these players , eight have recorded ten or more victories in total , one has a positive record against two members ( both are 2 – 1 win @-@ loss records ) , and none have a positive record against all four combined .

The only two other players who entered the top four in this period <unk> Martin del Potro ( 3 weeks ) and Robin Söderling ( 13 weeks ) . This run was ended when David Ferrer replaced Nadal in the top 4 following a period of injury for Nadal , and retained his place in the top 4 for much of 2013 as Roger Federer dropped down the rankings . 
 In this same period , Roger Federer , Rafael Nadal and Novak Djokovic all occupied the number one spot , with Murray reaching a career high of world No. 2 between 17 – 31 August in 2009 . Federer first achieved the feat in 2004 after winning his first Australian Open , whereas Nadal did in 2008 following his Olympics victory after three straight years of ending the year ranked world No. 2 , behind Federer . Similarly , Djokovic achieved world No. 1 status following his Wimbledon victory in 2011 , after four consecutive years at No. 3 , in a season which is regarded as one of the greatest in the history of the sport . He held his spot at the top of the rankings for exactly a year before being surpassed by Roger Federer in June 2012 after he won his 7th Wimbledon title , and by doing so , equalled Pete Sampras 's record of 7 Wimbledon titles and also surpassed his record of total weeks at world No. 1 , extending his stay to a total of 302 weeks before Djokovic retained his ranking at the season 's end after winning the 2012 ATP World Tour Finals and then solidified his position by retaining his Australian Open title , winning it for a record @-@ tying fourth time .

 = = = Current and former professionals = = = 
 Fellow top players , including David Ferrer , Tomas Berdych , Jo @-@ Wilfried Tsonga and Andy Roddick have all spoken about the dominance of the Big Four and the challenge they face in matching them . While the question of breaking through the dominance of the Big Four is a constant question the rest of the tour are constantly asked , many former top professionals have also spoken about the topic , including Björn Borg , Andre Agassi , Pete Sampras and Goran Ivanisevic . At the 2011 Wimbledon Championships , 11 @-@ time Major champion Björn Borg was quoted as saying : 
 = = = Media = = = 
 Since 2010 , when the Big Four increasingly began to dominate the tour as a group , most articles and reports concentrate solely on the members of the Big Four and their chances in upcoming tournaments or how the previous one has affected them , with smaller sections on the rest of the players . 
 = = = Wider impact on the sport = = = 
 For the most part , the presence of the Big Four is generally seen to have had a positive impact on tennis , making the sport more exciting and in turn attracting more attention . However , with all four members being from European countries , this may have had a potentially negative effect on interest in North America . It has also argued the dominance of the Big Four has made the game predictable or even boring . 
 = = = Murray 's position = = = 
 Some tennis commentators , including Murray himself , have spoken of a " Big Three " or " <unk> " , with Murray behind the other three players . Between September 2008 and January 2013 , Murray was the only one of the Big Four to have dropped outside of the top four rankings on the ATP Tour and is the only one never to have been ranked world number one . Also , he has an overall record of 28 @-@ 54 versus the Big Three . However , Murray has a total of twelve Masters 1000 titles , eleven career Major finals , including victories at the 2012 US Open and 2013 Wimbledon ( defeating Djokovic in both finals ) and 2016 Wimbledon ( defeating Raonic in final ) , won the 2012 Olympic Games , made 27 Major quarter @-@ finals and 20 semi @-@ finals , and has been ranked world No. 2 a total of 45 weeks dating back to 17 August 2009 . This has led to him being reported as " definitely part of the Big Four " since 2010 . 
 However , after losing his Wimbledon title defence to Grigor Dimitrov in the 2014 quarter @-@ finals , Murray dropped to No. 10 in the world rankings , making this the first time in six years that he had been ranked this low . This was the culmination of a poor twelve months in which he failed to reach a final , or register a top ten victory , following his Wimbledon triumph in 2013 , after recovering from major back surgery at the end of 2013 . Following a strong end to the 2014 season , Murray finally ranked back in the top four in February 2015 along with the rest of the Big Four for the first time since the start of 2013 , slowing the idea of the regression of the quartet . 
 Meanwhile , Roger Federer , by reaching the final , which he lost to Novak Djokovic , returned to number three in the world rankings , marking this the first time in two years that the top three places on the ATP World Rankings were all occupied by Djokovic , Nadal and Federer simultaneously . 
 = = = " Big Five " proposals = = = 
 Popular propositions have claimed that tennis has a " Big Five " , with either Juan Martín del Potro , Marin Čilić or Stanislas Wawrinka expanding the Big Four . The most accepted theory centres around Wawrinka , since he has won two Grand Slam championships . As of July 11 , 2016 , he has won more Grand Slam singles titles than any active player outside the Big Four since September 3 , 2006 , when Andre Agassi retired ( and has won as many Grand Slams as Lleyton Hewitt , who retired on July 4 , 2016 ) . From Roland Garros 2015 until Wimbledon 2016 , Wawrinka also had as many Grand Slam titles to his name as Andy Murray . 
 A testament to Stan Wawrinka 's suggested Big Five status is the fact that he is one of only three players outside the Big Four to have won a Grand Slam event between the 2005 Australian Open and 2016 Wimbledon . He is also one of only three players to have beaten each of the Big Four at Grand Slam level . Furthermore he defeated the world # 1 and world # 2 at each of his two grand slam titles . At the 2014 Australian Open , he beat world # 2 Djokovic 9 @-@ 7 in the fifth set of the quarter @-@ finals and then triumphed over world # 1 Nadal in 4 sets in the final . Then at the 2015 French Open , he defeated world # 2 Federer in straight sets during the quarter @-@ finals before prevailing against world # 1 Djokovic in the final after losing the first set . By virtue of this win over Djokovic , Wawrinka handed him his only loss in a Grand Slam in 2015 and it also thwarted Djokovic 's chances to complete the career grand slam . 
 Although the Big Four is often compared to successful tennis quartets of the past , some proponents of the Big Five concept have suggested that the dominant quartets in question were really quintets . For example , when considering the era of Borg , Connors , McEnroe and Lendl , Guillermo Vilas also springs to mind . Similarly , Mats Wilander was an integral part of the era that comprised Sampras , Edberg , Becker and Agassi . In like manner , such pundits argue , Stanislas Wawrinka is a quintessential player of the Big Four 's generation . 
 At the 2016 Australian Open , during Stanislas Wawrinka 's fourth round matchup with Milos Raonic , local commentator Bruce McAvaney made the comment : " I suppose it 's a big five , with Stan having the two Slams . " Ahead of the semifinal encounter between Murray and Wawrinka at the 2016 French Open however , Wawrinka dismissed the idea of a Big Five , describing Murray as " well ahead " of him : 
 = = = Golden era = = = 
 Some , including Steffi Graf and John McEnroe , believe the presence of the Big Four has coincided with that of a new " Golden Era " in men 's tennis since 2010 , wherein depth , athleticism and quality have never been better . The era has been compared to that of Rod Laver , Ken Rosewall , Roy Emerson and John Newcombe throughout the 1960s and that of Björn Borg , Jimmy Connors , John McEnroe and Ivan Lendl during the late 1970s and early 1980s . 
 While Novak Djokovic himself recognises it as a golden era , Roger Federer remains skeptical : 
 A comparison of the total top @-@ level singles titles won by this current Big Four and other previous dominant quartets helps to put things in perspective . As the table below shows , the Big Four 's career tallies of Grand Slam tournament titles , Masters Series titles , and overall titles have already surpassed the other three quartets . They have also matched the top Year End Tour Finals tally . 
 Note 1 
 An observation to make is that both Laver and Rosewall were banned from competing in Grand Slam tournaments during most of the <unk> quote Malcolm Knox a sports columnist " If grand slams are taken as the benchmark , consider this . The pro tour put Laver out of 20 grand slams from age 23 to 28 in his prime " . and instead competed in Professional Slam tournaments . The draw of the Pro majors was significantly smaller than the traditional tournaments of Grand Slam events ; usually they only had 16 or even less professional players . Though they were usually the top 16 ranked players in the world at the time . 
 Note 2 
 The focus of the article is on singles achievements and excludes notable doubles and mixed doubles titles across all six selection criteria won by previous big four candidates . If you take all results into consideration , then the following grouping of Laver / Rosewall / Emerson / Newcombe would add another 57 combined titles making their figure 133 titles overall , if we take the Borg / Connors / Lendl / McEnroe group a further 40 combined titles would make their tally 168 titles overall , and the grouping of Edberg / Agassi / Sampras / Becker would include 12 additional doubles titles bringing their total to 105 titles overall . Roger Federer 's own comments above reflect these facts in defining a new Golden period of tennis , " But then again we don 't play doubles . We don 't play mixed " , " but we have somewhat of a golden era right now " , however Nadal has won 3 Masters 1000 doubles titles , and Federer has won 1 Masters 1000 doubles title and an Olympic gold medal in doubles , which would therefore add 5 more titles to the Big Four 's Top @-@ Level tournament tally , bringing it to 157 titles overall .

 = = = Federer vs. Nadal = = = 
 Federer and Nadal have been playing each other since 2004 and their rivalry is a significant part of both men 's careers . It is also considered one of the greatest in history . They have played 34 times ( seventh @-@ highest in Open Era history ) , most recently in the 2015 Basel final , and Nadal leads their eleven @-@ year @-@ old rivalry 23 – 11 . 
 They held the top two rankings on the ATP Tour from July 2005 until 14 September 2009 , when Nadal fell to world No. 3 ( Andy Murray became the new No. 2 ) . They are the only pair of men to have ever finished four consecutive calendar years at the top , eventually with 6 years from 2005 to 2010 . Federer was ranked no . 1 for a record 237 consecutive weeks beginning in February 2004 . Nadal , who is five years younger , ascended to No. 2 in July 2005 and held this spot for a record 160 consecutive weeks before surpassing Federer in August 2008 . 
 Nadal leads their head @-@ to @-@ head 23 – 11 . Fifteen of their 34 matches have been on clay which is statistically Nadal 's best surface and Federer 's worst with 13 being in the final . Nadal has a winning record on outdoor hard courts ( 7 – 2 ) and clay ( 13 – 2 ) , while Federer leads on grass ( 2 – 1 ) and indoor hard courts ( 5 – 1 ) . Because tournament seedings are based on rankings , 21 of their matches have been in tournament finals which have included an all @-@ time record 8 Grand Slam tournament finals . From 2006 to 2008 they played in every French Open and Wimbledon final . Nadal won six of the eight , losing the first two Wimbledon finals . Three of these finals were five set @-@ matches ( 2007 and 2008 Wimbledon , 2009 Australian Open ) , with the 2008 Wimbledon final being lauded as the greatest match ever by many long @-@ time tennis analysts . 11 of their 32 meetings have reached a deciding set . They have also played in 10 Masters Series finals , including their lone five @-@ hour match at the 2006 Rome Masters which Nadal won in a fifth @-@ set tie @-@ break having saved two match points and at the 2005 Miami Masters where Federer came back from 2 sets down to win in nearly 4 hours . They also contested the final of the ATP World Tour Finals in 2010 with Federer winning in 3 sets . 
 = = = Djokovic vs. Nadal = = = 
 Djokovic and Nadal have the most head @-@ to @-@ head meetings in Open Era history with 49 meetings , which Djokovic leads 26 – 23 . Nadal leads on grass 2 – 1 and clay 14 – 7 , but Djokovic leads on hard courts 18 – 7 . They have met 13 times in Grand Slam tournaments with Nadal leading 9 – 4 , and 4 – 3 in finals . The rivalry is listed as the third greatest rivalry in the 2000s decade by <unk> and is widely considered to be the greatest rivalry in the history of the sport . Djokovic is the first player to have at least ten match wins against Nadal and the only person to defeat Nadal seven times consecutively . He is also only the second player to have defeated Nadal in more than one Grand Slam tournament final ( the other being Federer ) and the first to beat Nadal in a final on a surface other than grass . Their 2012 Australian Open encounter is considered by many to be the greatest match ever played and their 2012 French Open semifinal is considered the best clay court match ever played . 
 Between 2011 – 12 , they met in four consecutive Grand Slam tournament finals , just the second time in tennis history this has happened . In doing so , they also became the only players in history , except for Venus and Serena Williams , to have faced the same opponent in the finals of each of the four different Grand Slam events . Djokovic defeated Nadal in the first three ( from Wimbledon to the Australian Open ) , making Nadal the first player in history to lose three consecutive Grand Slam event finals . However , Nadal defeated Djokovic in the French Open final , denying him a Career Grand Slam and the opportunity to become the first man since Rod Laver to hold all four Majors at once . The two also share the record for the longest Australian Open and Grand Slam tournament final match ever played ( 5 hours and 53 minutes ) , at the 2012 Australian Open final . This and the 2013 French Open semifinal they contested , are considered two of the greatest matches of all time . At ATP Masters 1000 level , they have met 25 times , 12 of which were in the final ( a record ) , including the 2013 Monte @-@ Carlo Rolex Masters , where Djokovic ended Nadal 's 47 @-@ match winning run and eight @-@ year winning streak at the event . 
 = = = Djokovic vs. Federer = = = 
 Djokovic and Federer have played each other 45 times with Djokovic leading 23 – 22 . Djokovic leads on grass 2 – 1 , while they are tied 17 – 17 on hard courts and 4 – 4 on clay . In terms of number of matches played , it ranks as the second largest rivalry in the Open Era . The rivalry is the largest in Grand Slam tournament history with 15 matches played , having won against each other matches at each of the four Grand Slams . Djokovic leads this category 9 – 6 ( they are tied 3 – 3 at the US Open , 1 – 1 at Roland Garros , and Djokovic leads 3 – 1 in Australia and 2 @-@ 1 in Wimbledon ) . They have played in four Grand Slam tournament finals , the 2007 US Open , which Federer won in straight sets and at Wimbledon in 2014 and 2015 and the 2015 US Open , won by Djokovic . They 've also met in a record ten semifinals . The rivalry between Federer and Djokovic is considered one of the best in the Open Era . 
 Djokovic is the only player besides Nadal to defeat Federer in consecutive Grand Slam tournaments ( 2010 US Open and 2011 Australian Open ) , and the only player besides Nadal and Murray who has double @-@ figure career wins over Federer . Djokovic is one of four players currently on tour to have defeated Federer in straight sets at a Major and the only player to do it three times . Between 2007 – 2011 they played a record five times at the US Open ( tied with Lendl – McEnroe and Connors – Lendl ) , with Federer winning the first three and Djokovic the last two . This includes the 2010 and 2011 semifinals they contested , both of which Djokovic saved two match points before going on to win the match . In contrast Federer is the only player beside Nadal to have achieved 20 career wins against Djokovic and ended Djokovic 's 43 @-@ match winning streak and 41 – 0 start to the 2011 season , by defeating him in the French Open semifinals . These three matches have been classified among the greatest matches in tennis history by the ATP . 
 At ATP Masters 1000 level , they have met 18 times , and they are both tied 9 – 9 , while Djokovic leads 4 – 3 in finals . The pair have also contested one final at the 2012 ATP World Tour Finals , which Djokovic won in straight sets . They were scheduled to meet again in the 2014 final but Federer withdrew . The pair met four times in 2014 , in the semifinal of the Dubai Tennis Championships , with Federer recording his first victory over Djokovic since 2012 and first deciding set victory over another member of the Big Four since 2010 , in the final of Indian Wells the following week , with this time Djokovic coming out on top , Monte @-@ Carlo semifinal with Federer winning in straight sets , and at Wimbledon , with Djokovic winning in five sets . They have met six times so far in 2015 , at the final of the Dubai Tennis Championships with Federer winning in straight sets , the final of the Indian Wells Masters with Djokovic winning in three sets , the final of the Rome Masters , which Djokovic won in straight sets , the final of Wimbledon , which Djokovic won in four sets , the final of the Cincinnati Masters , which Federer won in straight sets and 2015 US Open , which Djokovic won in four sets .

The 4 hour 50 minute 2012 Australian Open semifinal between Murray and Djokovic is said to have given Murray the belief he needed to match the other members of the Big Four . Moreover , every Grand Slam tournament final of 2012 , all played between the Big Four , holds some historical significance . The 2012 Australian Open final was the longest Grand Slam tournament final in terms of time played , the 2012 French Open saw Rafael Nadal break the record for the most number of titles at the French Open , whereas Djokovic was attempting to become the first man to hold all four Majors since Rod Laver in 1969 .

 The 2007 Wimbledon Gentlemen 's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Men 's Singles tournament at the 2007 Wimbledon Championships . It pitted world No. 1 Roger Federer against world No. 2 Rafael Nadal in a Major final for the fourth time . This was a rematch of the Wimbledon final from the year before and would become the defining match of the Federer – Nadal rivalry up to that point . This was a historic match as Federer was trying to equal Björn Borg 's record of five consecutive Wimbledon titles , while Nadal was attempting to be the first man since Borg in 1980 to win the French Open and Wimbledon back @-@ to @-@ back ( this achievement is colloquially known as the " Channel Slam " ) . 
 Federer defeated Nadal in five compelling sets in three hours and forty @-@ five minutes , for a fifth consecutive Wimbledon championship ( equalling the feat achieved by Björn Borg ) . Borg himself returned to Wimbledon for the first time since losing the final in 1981 , saying " I just feel that this is the right time for me to come back , to hopefully watch Roger winning his fifth title in a row to match my record .

After 4 hours and 48 minutes , Nadal defeated Federer in five sets in failing light . A number of tennis critics promptly lauded it as the greatest match in tennis history . 
 This was the longest Wimbledon men 's singles final in history , clocking in at four hours and forty @-@ eight minutes . The match also featured numerous rain delays which meant the match finished in near darkness , at 21 : 15 BST , almost seven hours since the match started at 14 : 35 BST .

 The 2009 Australian Open Men 's Singles final was the championship tennis match of the Men 's Singles tournament at the 2009 Australian Open . It was contested between the world 's top two players for much of the previous four years , Rafael Nadal and Roger Federer then world number 's 1 and 2 respectively . It was their seventh ( out of eight ) Grand Slam tournament final meeting and it was the same final match up as had been previously at both the 2008 Wimbledon Men 's Singles final and 2008 French Men 's Singles final , both of which Nadal won . However this was Rafael Nadal 's first Major hardcourt final while it was Roger Federer 's ninth and was yet to lose in a Major hardcourt final . 
 Nadal defeated Federer in 5 sets in 4 hours and 19 minutes , with the match finishing after midnight , to become the first Spaniard to win the Australian Open . The match was lauded as one of the greatest ever at the Australian Open and it was yet another high quality match between two of the greatest players of all time , only 6 months since their epic 2008 Wimbledon final . It was a match of huge significance as had Federer won the match he would have equalled the all @-@ time Grand Slam tournament record of 14 by Pete Sampras and the open @-@ era record for most Australian Open titles of 4 with Andre Agassi ( he would go on to achieve these in the near future ) . However , as a result of Nadal winning he set his own records , holding 3 of the 4 slams at the same time for the first time in his career . Not only that but he became the first man in the open @-@ era to hold 3 Grand Slam tournament titles on 3 different surfaces at the same time . This victory over Federer many believed brought about a change in the tennis standings as Nadal was now clearly the number 1 player after Federer had that title for over 4 and a half years consecutively with Nadal deemed the second best for nearly 3 years of that . The defeat brought Federer to tears as he came to terms with his loss . 
 The match statistics followed a similar pattern to those at the 2008 Wimbledon Final , with Federer having a lower first serve percentage against Nadal ( 51 % vs 64 % ) and he again couldn 't be as <unk> on break point opportunities with only 31 % break points converted for Federer whereas Nadal converted 43 % of his break points . However the total points by each player proved even closer that that at that Wimbledon final , as Federer won 1 more point than Nadal ( 174 vs 173 ) yet still lost this final .

 Nadal defeated Djokovic in four sets in three hours and forty @-@ three minutes , to win his first US Open title , and thus complete the Career Golden Slam ( equalling the feat achieved by Andre Agassi ) . He also became the first Spaniard since Manuel Orantes in 1975 to win at Flushing Meadows , became the first man since Rod Laver in 1969 to win Major titles at the French Open , Wimbledon and US Open simultaneously and became only the second man after Laver to hold two Major titles on each surface ( hard , clay and grass ) . The second set which Djokovic won was the only set Nadal lost in the entire championships . This would prove to become the main rivalry in tennis over the next 18 months .

It was the first Grand Slam tournament in which Djokovic had ever been seeded higher than Federer . Djokovic had defeated Federer in their three previous meetings in 2011 , however , Federer shocked many by taking the first two sets . Djokovic won the third set and as the fourth set went on the light began to fade and it was clear that if the match went to a fifth set it would have to be continued the next day . Djokovic served for the fourth set at 5 – 4 but was broken and Federer closed out the match in a tiebreaker . 
 Federer then played Nadal in the final , which was their record eighth encounter in a Grand Slam tournament final . Nadal defeated Federer for the fifth time at Roland Garros and tied Björn Borg 's record of six French Open titles .

John McEnroe claimed it surpassed the 2008 Wimbledon final as the best tennis match of all time , while legends Pete Sampras , Mats Wilander , and Björn Borg said it was the best match they saw in their lifetime . After the 2012 Australian Open , Rod Laver came out with his greatest in the amateur and Open Era lists , Djokovic was ranked 6th and Nadal 5th on the Open Era list .

 Federer defeated Murray in four riveting sets in three hours and forty @-@ four minutes , to capture a record equalling seventh Wimbledon championship , and a record breaking seventeenth Major title .

 The 2013 French Open Men 's Singles semifinal was a rematch of the prior year 's final between Nadal and Djokovic .

But one of those losses was to Djokovic in Monte Carlo , ending Nadal 's record streak of 8 consecutive titles there . Djokovic was very motivated to win this match , having said winning his first French Open title was his highest priority of 2013 , plus his desire to dedicate the title in honor of his recently deceased childhood tennis coach . 
 The match was a see @-@ saw five setter with Nadal prevailing 9 – 7 in the fifth after 4 hours and 37 minutes . Analyst Steve <unk> summed it up : " This epic was a mirror image of their last one , in the 2012 Australian Open final . That day it had been Nadal who had survived a near @-@ death experience in the fourth set , won it in a tiebreaker , and taken a 4 – 2 lead in the fifth before watching Djokovic storm back for the title . Today it was Nole who broke Rafa at 3 – 4 in the fourth and again at 5 – 6 , grabbed that set in a tiebreaker , and led 4 – 2 in the fifth before watching Nadal take it all away . In each of those matches , the loser was haunted by a stunning , crucial lapse . In Australia , with a chance to go up 5 – 2 in the fifth , Nadal had missed the easiest of backhand passing shots . In Paris , serving at 4 – 3 in the final set , Djokovic gave away a point when he ran into the net after hitting what would have been a winning overhead . " 
 Numerous tennis pundits and legends including Ivan Lendl , Andre Agassi , Bjorn Borg , Boris Becker , and John McEnroe claimed this was the greatest clay court match to ever take place in tennis history . ESPN commentator Chris Fowler and Patrick McEnroe even echoed this very remark during the broadcast of this match . 
 Nadal then won the title for the fourth consecutive year . This was his 8th overall French title , making him the first man to win 8 titles at any Grand Slam tournament .

 U2 are an Irish rock band from Dublin . Formed in 1976 , the group consists of Bono ( lead vocals and rhythm guitar ) , the Edge ( lead guitar , keyboards , and backing vocals ) , Adam Clayton ( bass guitar ) , and Larry Mullen Jr . ( drums and percussion ) . U2 's early sound was rooted in post @-@ punk but eventually grew to incorporate influences from many genres of popular music . Throughout the group 's musical pursuits , they have maintained a sound built on melodic instrumentals . Their lyrics , often embellished with spiritual imagery , focus on personal themes and sociopolitical concerns . 
 The band formed at Mount Temple Comprehensive School in 1976 when the members were teenagers with limited musical proficiency . Within four years , they signed with Island Records and released their debut album Boy . By the mid @-@ 1980s , U2 had become a top international act . They were more successful as a touring act than they were at selling records until their 1987 album The Joshua Tree which , according to Rolling Stone Magazine , elevated the band 's stature " from heroes to superstars " . Reacting to musical stagnation and criticism of their earnest image and musical direction in the late 1980s , U2 reinvented themselves with their 1991 album , Achtung Baby , and the accompanying Zoo TV Tour ; they integrated dance , industrial , and alternative rock influences into their sound , and embraced a more ironic and self @-@ deprecating image . They embraced similar experimentation for the remainder of the 1990s with varying levels of success . U2 regained critical and commercial favour in the 2000s with the records All That You Can 't Leave Behind ( 2000 ) and How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb ( 2004 ) , which established a more conventional , mainstream sound for the group . Their U2 360 ° Tour of 2009 – 2011 is the highest @-@ attended and highest @-@ grossing concert tour in history . 
 U2 have released 13 studio albums and are one of the world 's best @-@ selling music artists of all time , having sold more than 170 million records worldwide . They have won 22 Grammy Awards , more than any other band , and , in 2005 , were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in their first year of eligibility . Rolling Stone ranked U2 at number 22 in its list of the " 100 Greatest Artists of All Time " . Throughout their career , as a band and as individuals , they have campaigned for human rights and philanthropic causes , including Amnesty International , the ONE / DATA campaigns , Product Red , War Child and the Edge 's Music Rising .

 The band formed in Dublin on 25 September 1976 . Larry Mullen , Jr . , then a 14 @-@ year @-@ old student at Mount Temple Comprehensive School , posted a note on the school 's notice board in search of musicians for a new band — six people responded . Setting up in his kitchen , Mullen was on drums , with Paul Hewson ( Bono ) on lead vocals ; David Evans ( The Edge ) and his older brother Dik Evans on guitar ; Adam Clayton , a friend of the Evans brothers on bass guitar ; and initially Ivan McCormick and Peter Martin , two other friends of Mullen . Mullen later described it as " ' The Larry Mullen Band ' for about ten minutes , then Bono walked in and blew any chance I had of being in charge . " Soon after , the group settled on the name " Feedback " because it was one of the few technical terms they knew . Martin was the first to drop out of the group , and McCormick left within a few weeks of the first practice . Most of the group 's initial material consisted of cover songs , which the band admitted was not their forte . Some of the earliest influences on the band were emerging punk rock acts , such as the Jam , the Clash , Buzzcocks , and Sex Pistols . The popularity of punk rock convinced the group that musical proficiency was not a prerequisite to being successful . 
 In March 1977 , the band changed their name to " the Hype " . Dik Evans , who was older and by this time at college , was becoming the odd man out . The rest of the band was leaning towards the idea of a four @-@ piece ensemble and he was " phased out " in March 1978 . During a farewell concert in the Presbyterian Church Hall in Howth , which featured the Hype playing covers , Dik ceremonially walked offstage . The remaining four band members completed the concert playing original material as " U2 " . Steve Averill , a punk rock musician ( with the <unk> ) and family friend of Clayton 's , had suggested six potential names from which the band chose " U2 " for its ambiguity and open @-@ ended interpretations , and because it was the name that they disliked the least . 
 On Saint Patrick 's Day in 1978 , U2 won a talent show in Limerick . The prize consisted of £ 500 and studio time to record a demo which would be heard by CBS Ireland , a record label . This win was an important milestone and affirmation for the fledgling band . U2 recorded their first demo tape at Keystone Studios in Dublin in May 1978 . Hot Press magazine was influential in shaping the band 's future ; in May , Paul McGuinness , who had earlier been introduced to the band by the publication 's journalist Bill Graham , agreed to be U2 's manager . The group 's first release , an Ireland @-@ only EP entitled Three , was released in September 1979 and was their first Irish chart success . In December 1979 , U2 performed in London for their first shows outside Ireland , although they were unable to gain much attention from audiences or critics . In February 1980 , their second single " Another Day " was released on the CBS label , but again only for the Irish market . 
 = = = Boy , October , and War ( 1980 – 84 ) = = = 
 Island Records signed U2 in March 1980 , and in May the band released " 11 O 'Clock Tick Tock " as their first international single . The band 's debut album , Boy , followed in October . Produced by Steve Lillywhite , it received generally positive reviews . Although Bono 's unfocused lyrics seemed improvised , they expressed a common theme : the dreams and frustrations of adolescence . The album included the band 's first United States hit single , " I Will Follow " . Boy 's release was followed by the Boy Tour , U2 's first tour of continental Europe and the United States . Despite being unpolished , these early live performances demonstrated U2 's potential , as critics noted that Bono was a " charismatic " and " passionate " showman . 
 The band 's second album , October , was released in 1981 and contained overtly spiritual themes . During the album 's recording sessions , Bono and the Edge considered quitting the band due to perceived spiritual conflicts . Bono , the Edge , and Mullen had joined a Christian group in Dublin called the " Shalom Fellowship " , which led them to question the relationship between the Christian faith and the rock and roll lifestyle . Bono and the Edge took time off between tours and decided to leave Shalom in favour of continuing with the band . Recording was further complicated when a briefcase containing working lyrics and musical ideas was lost during a performance at a nightclub in Portland , Oregon . The album received mixed reviews and limited radio play . Low sales outside the UK put pressure on their contract with Island and focused the band on improvement . 
 Resolving their doubts of the October period , U2 released War in February 1983 . A record on which the band " turned pacifism itself into a crusade " , War 's sincerity and " rugged " guitar was intentionally at odds with the <unk> synthpop of the time . The album included the politically charged " Sunday Bloody Sunday " , in which Bono lyrically tried to contrast the events of Bloody Sunday with Easter Sunday . Rolling Stone magazine wrote that the song showed the band was capable of deep and meaningful songwriting . War was U2 's first album to feature the photography of Anton Corbijn , who remains U2 's principal photographer and has had a major influence on their vision and public image . U2 's first commercial success , War debuted at number one in the UK , and its first single , " New Year 's Day " , was the band 's first hit outside Ireland or the UK . 
 On the subsequent War Tour , the band performed sold @-@ out concerts in mainland Europe and the US . The sight of Bono waving a white flag during performances of " Sunday Bloody Sunday " became the tour 's iconic image . U2 recorded the Under a Blood Red Sky live album and the Live at Red Rocks concert film on tour , both of which received extensive play on the radio and MTV , expanding the band 's audience and showcasing their prowess as a live act . With their record deal with Island Records coming to an end , the band signed a more lucrative extension in 1984 . They negotiated the return of their copyrights ( so that they owned the rights to their own songs ) , an increase in their royalty rate , and a general improvement in terms , at the expense of a larger initial payment . 
 = = = The Unforgettable Fire and Live Aid ( 1984 – 85 ) = = = 
 The band feared that following the overt rock of the War album and tour , they were in danger of becoming another " shrill " , " sloganeering arena @-@ rock band " . Bono said the group was confident that fans were ready to embrace them as successors to the Who and Led Zeppelin , but according to him , " something just didn 't feel right . We felt we had more dimension than just the next big anything , we had something unique to offer . " Thus , they sought experimentation for their fourth studio album , The Unforgettable Fire ; as Adam Clayton recalls , " We were looking for something that was a bit more serious , more arty . " The Edge admired the ambient and " weird works " of Brian Eno , who , along with his engineer Daniel Lanois , eventually agreed to produce the record . Island Records boss Chris Blackwell initially tried to discourage them from their choice of producers , believing that just when the band were about to achieve the highest levels of success , Eno would " bury them under a layer of avant @-@ garde nonsense " . 
 Partly recorded in Slane Castle , The Unforgettable Fire was released in 1984 and was at the time the band 's most marked change in direction . It was ambient and abstract , and featured a rich , orchestrated sound . Under Lanois ' direction , Mullen 's drumming became looser , funkier , and more subtle , and Clayton 's bass became more subliminal . Complementing the album 's atmospheric sound , the lyrics are open to interpretation , providing what the band called a " very visual feel " . Due to a tight recording schedule , however , Bono felt songs like " Bad " and " Pride ( In the Name of Love ) " were incomplete " sketches " . The album reached number one in Britain , and was successful in the US . The lead single " Pride ( In the Name of Love ) " , written about Martin Luther King , Jr . , was the band 's biggest hit to that point and was their first song to chart in the US top 40 . 
 Much of the Unforgettable Fire Tour moved into indoor arenas as U2 began to win their long battle to build their audience . The complex textures of the new studio @-@ recorded tracks , such as " The Unforgettable Fire " and " Bad " , posed a challenge in translating to live performances . One solution was programmed sequencers , which the band had previously been reluctant to use , but are now used in the majority of the band 's performances . Songs on the album had been criticised as being " unfinished " , " fuzzy " , and " unfocused " , but were better received by critics when played on stage . Rolling Stone , which was critical of the album version of " Bad " , described its live performance as a " show stopper " . 
 U2 participated in the Live Aid concert for Ethiopian famine relief at Wembley Stadium in July 1985 . U2 's performance in front of 72 @,@ 000 fans in the stadium in an event that had a worldwide television audience of two billion people was a pivotal point in the band 's career . During a 12 @-@ minute performance of the song " Bad " , Bono leapt down off the stage to embrace and dance with a fan , showing a television audience the personal connection that Bono could make with audiences . In 1985 , Rolling Stone magazine called U2 the " Band of the ' 80s " , saying that " for a growing number of rock @-@ and @-@ roll fans , U2 have become the band that matters most , maybe even the only band that matters " . 
 = = = The Joshua Tree and Rattle and Hum ( 1986 – 90 ) = = = 
 For their fifth album , The Joshua Tree , the band wanted to build on The Unforgettable Fire 's textures , but instead of out @-@ of @-@ focus experimentation , they sought a harder @-@ hitting sound within the limitation of conventional song structures . Realising that " U2 had no tradition " and that their knowledge of music from before their childhood was limited , the group delved into American and Irish roots music . Friendships with Bob Dylan , Van Morrison , and Keith Richards motivated the band to explore blues , folk , and gospel music and focused Bono on his skills as a songwriter and lyricist . U2 interrupted the album sessions in mid @-@ 1986 to serve as a headline act on Amnesty International 's A Conspiracy of Hope tour . Rather than being a distraction , the tour added extra intensity and focus to their new material . Later that year , Bono travelled to San Salvador and Nicaragua and saw first @-@ hand the distress of peasants bullied in internal conflicts that were subject to US political intervention . The experience became a central influence on the new music . 
 The Joshua Tree was released in March 1987 . The album juxtaposes antipathy towards US foreign policy against the group 's deep fascination with the country , its open spaces , freedom , and ideals . The band wanted music with a sense of location and a " cinematic " quality , and the record 's music and lyrics draw on imagery created by American writers whose works the band had been reading . The Joshua Tree became the fastest @-@ selling album in British chart history , and topped the Billboard 200 in the United States for nine consecutive weeks . The first two singles , " With or Without You " and " I Still Haven 't Found What I 'm Looking For " , quickly became the group 's first number @-@ one hits in the US . They became the fourth rock band to be featured on the cover of Time magazine , which called them " Rock 's Hottest Ticket " . The album won U2 their first two Grammy Awards , and it brought them a new level of success . Many publications , including Rolling Stone , have cited it as one of rock 's greatest . The Joshua Tree Tour was the first tour on which the band played shows in stadiums alongside smaller arena shows , and it grossed US $ 40 million . 
 In October 1988 , the group released Rattle and Hum , a double album and theatrically released documentary film that captured the band 's experiences with American roots music on the Joshua Tree Tour . The record featured nine studio tracks and six live U2 performances , including recordings at Sun Studios in Memphis and performances with Bob Dylan and B. B. King . Intended as a tribute to American music , the project received mixed reviews from both film and music critics ; one Rolling Stone editor spoke of the album 's " excitement " , another described it as " bombastic and misguided " . The film 's director , Phil Joanou , described it as " an overly pretentious look at U2 " . Despite the criticism , the album sold 14 million copies and reached number one worldwide . Lead single " Desire " became the band 's first UK number @-@ one song while reaching number three in the US . Most of the album 's new material was played on 1989 's Lovetown Tour , which only visited Australasia , Japan and Europe , so as to avoid the critical backlash the group faced in the US . In addition , they had grown dissatisfied with their live performances ; Mullen recalled that " We were the biggest , but we weren 't the best " . With a sense of musical stagnation , Bono said to fans on one of the last dates of the tour that it was " the end of something for U2 " and that they had to " go away and ... just dream it all up again " . 
 = = = Achtung Baby , Zoo TV , and Zooropa ( 1990 – 93 ) = = = 
 Stung by the criticism of Rattle and Hum , the band sought to transform themselves musically . Seeking inspiration on the eve of German reunification , they began work on their seventh studio album , Achtung Baby , at Hansa Studios in Berlin in October 1990 with producers Daniel Lanois and Brian Eno . The sessions were fraught with conflict , as the band argued over their musical direction and the quality of their material . While Clayton and Mullen preferred a sound similar to U2 's previous work , Bono and the Edge were inspired by European industrial music and electronic dance music and advocated a change . Weeks of tension and slow progress nearly prompted the group to break up until they made a breakthrough with the improvised writing of the song " One " . They returned to Dublin in 1991 , where morale improved and the majority of the album was completed . 
 Achtung Baby was released in November 1991 . The album represented a calculated change in musical and thematic direction for the group ; the shift was one of their most dramatic since The Unforgettable Fire . Sonically , the record incorporated influences from alternative rock , dance , and industrial music of the time , and the band referred to its musical departure as " four men chopping down the Joshua Tree " . Thematically , it was a more introspective and personal record ; it was darker , yet at times more flippant than the band 's previous work . Commercially and critically , it has been one of the band 's most successful albums . It produced five hit singles , including " The Fly " , " Mysterious Ways " , and " One " , and it was a crucial part of the band 's early 1990s reinvention . Like The Joshua Tree , many publications have cited the record as one of rock 's greatest . 
 Like Achtung Baby , the 1992 – 1993 Zoo TV Tour was an unequivocal break with the band 's past . In contrast to the austere stage setups of previous U2 tours , Zoo TV was an elaborate multimedia event . It satirised the pervasive nature of television and its blurring of news , entertainment , and home shopping by attempting to instill " sensory overload " in its audience . The stage featured large video screens that showed visual effects , random video clips from pop culture , and flashing text phrases . Whereas U2 were known for their earnest performances in the 1980s , the group 's Zoo TV performances were intentionally ironic and self @-@ deprecating ; on stage , Bono performed as several over @-@ the @-@ top characters , including " The Fly " , " Mirror Ball Man " , and " MacPhisto " . Prank phone calls were made to President Bush , the United Nations , and others . Live satellite link @-@ ups to war @-@ torn Sarajevo caused controversy . 
 In June 1993 , U2 signed a long @-@ term , six @-@ album deal to remain with Island Records / PolyGram . The Los Angeles Times estimated that the deal was worth US $ 60 million to the band , making them the highest @-@ paid rock group ever . 
 Quickly recorded during a break in the Zoo TV Tour in early 1993 , the Zooropa album expanded on many of the themes from Achtung Baby and the Zoo TV Tour . Initially intended as an EP , Zooropa ultimately evolved into a full @-@ length LP album . It was an even greater departure from the style of their earlier recordings , incorporating further dance influences and other electronic effects . Johnny Cash sang the lead vocals on " The Wanderer " . Most of the songs were played at least once during the 1993 legs of the tour , which visited Europe , Australia , New Zealand and Japan ; half the album 's tracks became permanent fixtures in the setlist . Although the commercially successful Zooropa won the Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album in 1994 , the band regard it with mixed feelings , as they felt it was more of " an interlude " . 
 On the final leg of the tour , Clayton was unable to perform for the group 's 26 November 1993 show in Sydney , the dress @-@ rehearsal for filming Zoo TV : Live from Sydney , due to a hangover . Bass guitar technician Stuart Morgan filled in for him , marking the first time any member of U2 had missed a show . After the incident , Clayton gave up drinking alcohol . 
 = = = Passengers , Pop , and PopMart ( 1994 – 99 ) = = = 
 In 1995 , following a long break , U2 contributed " Hold Me , Thrill Me , Kiss Me , Kill Me " to the soundtrack album of the film Batman Forever . Later that year , the band released an experimental album called Original Soundtracks 1 . Brian Eno , producer of four previous U2 albums , contributed as a full partner , including writing and performing . For this reason and due to the record 's highly experimental nature , the band chose to release it under the moniker " Passengers " to distinguish it from U2 's conventional albums . Mullen said of the album , " There 's a thin line between interesting music and self @-@ indulgence . We crossed it on the Passengers record . " It was commercially unnoticed by U2 standards and it received generally mixed reviews . However , the single " Miss Sarajevo " featuring Luciano Pavarotti , was among Bono 's favourite U2 songs . 
 On 1997 's Pop , U2 continued experimenting with dance club culture ; tape loops , programming , rhythm sequencing , and sampling provided much of the album with heavy , funky dance rhythms . Released in March , the album debuted at number one in 35 countries and drew mainly positive reviews . Rolling Stone , for example , stated that U2 had " defied the odds and made some of the greatest music of their lives " ; others felt that the album was a major disappointment . Sales were poor compared to previous U2 releases . The band was hurried into completing the album in time for the impending pre @-@ booked tour , and Bono admitted that the album " didn 't communicate the way it was intended to " . 
 The subsequent tour , PopMart , commenced in April 1997 . Like Zoo TV , it poked fun at pop culture and was intended as a send @-@ up of commercialism . The stage included a 100 @-@ foot ( 30 m ) tall golden yellow arch ( reminiscent of the McDonald 's logo ) , a 150 @-@ foot ( 46 m ) long video screen , and a 40 @-@ foot ( 12 m ) tall mirrorball lemon . U2 's " big shtick " failed , however , to satisfy many who were seemingly confused by the band 's new kitsch image and elaborate sets . The postponement of Pop 's release date to complete the album meant rehearsal time for the tour was severely reduced , and performances in early shows suffered . Despite the mixed reviews and difficulties of the tour , Bono considered PopMart to be " better than Zoo TV aesthetically , and as an art project it is a clearer thought . " He later explained , " When that show worked , it was mindblowing . " A highlight of the tour was the concert in Sarajevo where U2 were the first major group to perform there following the Bosnian War . Mullen described the concert as " an experience I will never forget for the rest of my life , and if I had to spend 20 years in the band just to play that show , and have done that , I think it would have been worthwhile . " Bono called the show " one of the toughest and one of the sweetest nights of my life " . One month after the conclusion of the PopMart Tour , U2 appeared on the 200th episode of the animated sitcom The Simpsons , " Trash of the Titans " , in which Homer Simpson disrupted the band on stage during a PopMart concert . 
 = = = " <unk> for the job of the best band in the world " ( 2000 – 06 ) = = = 
 Following the relatively disappointing reception of Pop , U2 declared they were " <unk> for the job ... [ of ] the best band in the world " . The group 's tenth album , All That You Can 't Leave Behind , was released in October 2000 and was produced by Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois . The record signaled a return to a more mainstream , conventional rock sound for the group mixed with the influences of their 1990s musical explorations . For many of those not won over by the band 's 1990s music , it was considered a return to grace ; Rolling Stone called it U2 's " third masterpiece " alongside The Joshua Tree and Achtung Baby . The album debuted at number one in 32 countries , and its worldwide hit single , " Beautiful Day " , earned three Grammy Awards . The album 's other three singles , " Stuck in a Moment You Can 't Get Out Of " , " Elevation " and " Walk On " , also won Grammy Awards . 
 For the Elevation Tour of 2001 , U2 performed in a scaled @-@ down setting , returning to arenas after nearly a decade of stadium productions . A heart @-@ shaped ramp around the stage permitted greater proximity to the audience . During the tour , the group headlined a pair of Slane Concerts in Ireland , playing to crowds of 80 @,@ 000 . Following the September 11 attacks , All That You Can 't Leave Behind found added resonance with audiences , and in October , U2 performed at Madison Square Garden in New York City for the first time since the attacks . Bono and the Edge later said these shows were among their most memorable and emotional performances . In February 2002 , U2 performed during the halftime show of Super Bowl XXXVI and paid tribute to the victims of September 11 . SI.com and Rolling Stone ranked their performance as the best halftime show in Super Bowl history . 
 U2 's eleventh studio album , How to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb , was released in November 2004 . The band were looking for a harder @-@ hitting rock sound than All That You Can 't Leave Behind . Thematically , Bono stated that " a lot of the songs are paeans to naiveté , a rejection of knowingness . " The first single , " Vertigo " , was featured in an internationally aired television commercial for the Apple iPod ; a U2 iPod and an iTunes @-@ exclusive U2 box set were released as part of a promotion with Apple . The album debuted at number one in the US , where first @-@ week sales of 840 @,@ 000 nearly doubled those of All That You Can 't Leave Behind , setting a personal best for the band . Claiming it as a contender as one of U2 's three best albums , Bono said , " There are no weak songs . But as an album , the whole isn 't greater than the sum of its parts , and it fucking annoys me . " The Vertigo Tour featured a setlist that varied more across dates than any U2 tour since the Lovetown Tour , and it included songs not played since the early 1980s . Like the Elevation Tour , the Vertigo Tour was a commercial success . The album and its singles won Grammy Awards in all eight categories in which U2 were nominated . In 2005 , Bruce Springsteen inducted U2 into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame . A 3 @-@ D concert film , U2 3D , filmed at nine concerts during the Latin American and Australian legs of the Vertigo Tour was released in theatres on 23 January 2008 . 
 In August 2006 , the band incorporated its publishing business in the Netherlands following the capping of Irish artists ' tax exemption at € 250 @,@ 000 . The Edge stated that businesses often seek to minimise their tax burdens . The move was criticised in the Irish parliament . The band defended themselves , saying approximately 95 % of their business took place outside Ireland , that they were taxed globally because of this , and that they were all " personal investors and employers in the country " . Bono would later say , " I think U2 's tax business is our own business and I think it is not just to the letter of the law but to the spirit of the law . " 
 = = = No Line on the Horizon and U2 360 ° Tour ( 2006 – 2013 ) = = = 
 Recording for U2 's twelfth album , No Line on the Horizon , began with producer Rick Rubin in 2006 , but the sessions were short @-@ lived and the material was shelved . In May 2007 , the group began new sessions with Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois in Fez , Morocco , involving the producers in the songwriting process . Intending to write " future hymns " — songs that would be played forever — the group spent two weeks recording in a riad and exploring North African music . In March 2008 , the band signed a 12 @-@ year deal with Live Nation worth an estimated $ 100 million ( £ 50 million ) , which includes Live Nation controlling the band 's merchandise , sponsoring , and their official website . Recording on the album lasted through December 2008 in the US , the UK , and Ireland . Intended as a more experimental work than their previous two albums , No Line on the Horizon was released in February 2009 and received generally positive reviews , including their first five @-@ star Rolling Stone review . Critics , however , did not find it to be as experimental as originally billed . The album debuted at number one in over 30 countries , but its sales of 5 million were seen as a disappointment by U2 standards and it did not contain a hit single . 
 The group embarked on the U2 360 ° Tour in June 2009 . The concerts featured the band playing stadiums " in the round " on a circular stage , allowing the audience to surround them on all sides . To accommodate the stage configuration , a large four @-@ legged structure nicknamed " The Claw " was built above the stage , with the sound system and a cylindrical , expanding video screen on top of it . At 50 meters ( 165 feet ) tall , it was the largest stage ever constructed . The tour visited Europe and North America in 2009 . At year 's end , Rolling Stone named U2 one of eight " Artists of the Decade " . The group 's tours ranked them second in total concert grosses for the decade behind only the Rolling Stones , although U2 had a significantly higher attendance figure . They were the only band in the top 25 touring acts of the 2000s to sell out every show they played . U2 resumed the 360 ° Tour in 2010 with legs in Europe , Australia , and New Zealand . However , their scheduled headline appearance at the Glastonbury Festival 2010 and their North American leg that year were postponed following a serious injury to Bono 's back . These appearances were rescheduled for 2011 after the South African and South American legs of the tour . By its conclusion in July 2011 , U2 360 ° had set records for the highest @-@ grossing concert tour with $ 736 million in ticket sales , and for the highest @-@ attended tour with over 7 @.@ 2 million tickets sold . 
 Following the release of No Line on the Horizon , U2 announced tentative plans for a follow @-@ up record of songs from the album 's sessions entitled Songs of Ascent . Bono described the project as " a meditative , reflective piece of work " with the theme of pilgrimage . However , the group could not complete it to their satisfaction , and ultimately it did not come to fruition . The band continued to work on other album projects , including a traditional rock album produced by Danger Mouse and a dance @-@ centric album produced by RedOne and will.i.am. 
 = = = Songs of Innocence and Innocence + Experience Tour ( 2013 – present ) = = = 
 U2 suspended work on their next album late in 2013 to contribute a new song , " Ordinary Love " , to the film Mandela : Long Walk to Freedom . The track , written in honour of Nelson Mandela , won the 2014 Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song . In November 2013 , U2 's long @-@ time manager Paul McGuinness stepped down from his post as part of a deal with Live Nation to acquire his management firm , Principle Management . McGuinness , who had managed U2 for over 30 years , was succeeded by Guy Oseary . In February 2014 , another new song , the single " Invisible " , was debuted in a Super Bowl television advertisement and was made available in the iTunes Store at no cost to launch a partnership with Product Red and Bank of America to fight AIDS . Bono called the track a " sneak preview " of its pending record . 
 On 9 September 2014 , U2 announced their thirteenth studio album , Songs of Innocence , at an Apple product launch event , and released it digitally the same day to all iTunes Store customers at no cost . The release made the album available to over 500 million iTunes customers in what Apple CEO Tim Cook called " the largest album release of all time . " Apple reportedly paid Universal Music Group and U2 a lump sum for a five @-@ week exclusivity period in which to distribute the album and spent $ 100 million on a promotional campaign . Produced by Danger Mouse with Paul Epworth , Ryan Tedder , Declan Gaffney and long @-@ time collaborator Flood , Songs of Innocence recalls the group members ' youth in Ireland , touching on childhood experiences , loves and losses , while paying tribute to musical inspirations . Bono described it as " the most personal album we 've written . " The record received mixed reviews and drew criticism for its digital release strategy ; it was automatically added to users ' iTunes accounts , which for many , triggered an unprompted download to their devices . Chris Richards of The Washington Post called the release " rock @-@ and @-@ roll as dystopian junk mail " . The group 's press tour for the album was interrupted after Bono was seriously injured in a bicycle accident in Central Park on 16 November 2014 . He suffered fractures of his shoulder blade , humerus , orbit , and pinky finger , leading to uncertainty that he would ever be able to play guitar again . 
 Following Bono 's recuperation , U2 embarked on the Innocence + Experience Tour in May 2015 . Comprising 76 shows , the tour visited arenas in North America and Europe from May through December . The group structured their concerts around a loose autobiographical narrative of " innocence " passing into " experience " , with a fixed set of songs for the first half of each show and a varying second half , separated by an intermission — a first for U2 concerts . The stage spanned the length of the venue floor and was divided into three sections : a rectangular main stage , a smaller circular B @-@ stage , and a walkway between them . A 96 @-@ foot @-@ long double @-@ sided video screen was suspended above and parallel to the walkway ; the structure featured an interior catwalk between the screens , allowing the band members to perform amidst the video projections . U2 's sound system was moved to the venue ceilings and arranged in an oval array , in hopes of improving acoustics by evenly distributing sound throughout the arena . In total , the tour grossed $ 152 @.@ 2 million from 1 @.@ 29 million tickets sold . The final date of the tour , one of two Paris shows rescheduled due to the 13 November 2015 attacks in the city , was filmed for the video Innocence + Experience : Live in Paris and broadcast on the American television network HBO . 
 = = Musical style = = 
 = = = Instrumentation = = = 
 Since their inception , U2 have developed and maintained a distinctly recognisable sound , with emphasis on melodic instrumentals and expressive , larger @-@ than @-@ life vocals . This approach is rooted partly in the early influence of record producer Steve Lillywhite at a time when the band was not known for musical proficiency . The Edge has consistently used a rhythmic echo and a signature delay to craft his distinctive guitar work , coupled with an Irish @-@ influenced drone played against his syncopated melodies that ultimately yields a well @-@ defined ambient , chiming sound . Bono has nurtured his falsetto operatic voice and has exhibited a notable lyrical bent towards social , political , and personal subject matter while maintaining a grandiose scale in his songwriting . In addition , the Edge has described U2 as a fundamentally live band . 
 Despite these broad consistencies , U2 have introduced brand new elements into their musical repertoire with each new album . U2 's early sound was influenced by bands such as Television and Joy Division , and has been described as containing a " sense of exhilaration " that resulted from the Edge 's " radiant chords " and Bono 's " ardent vocals " . U2 's sound began with post @-@ punk roots and minimalistic and uncomplicated instrumentals heard on Boy and October , but evolved through War to include aspects of rock anthem , funk , and dance rhythms to become more versatile and aggressive . Boy and War were labelled " muscular and assertive " by Rolling Stone , influenced in large part by Lillywhite 's producing . The Unforgettable Fire , which began with the Edge playing more keyboards than guitars , as well as follow @-@ up The Joshua Tree , had Brian Eno and Daniel Lanois at the production helm . With their influence , both albums achieved a " diverse texture " . The songs from The Joshua Tree and Rattle and Hum placed more emphasis on Lanois @-@ inspired rhythm as they mixed distinct and varied styles of gospel and blues music , which stemmed from the band 's burgeoning fascination with America 's culture , people and places . In the 1990s , U2 reinvented themselves as they began using synthesisers , distortion , and electronic beats derived from alternative rock , industrial music , dance , and hip @-@ hop on Achtung Baby , Zooropa , and Pop . In the 2000s , U2 returned to a more stripped @-@ down sound , with more conventional rhythms and reduced usage of synthesisers and effects . 
 = = = Lyrics and themes = = = 
 U2 's lyrics are known for their social and political commentary , and are often embellished with Christian and spiritual imagery . Songs such as " Sunday Bloody Sunday " , " Silver and Gold " , and " Mothers of the Disappeared " were motivated by current events of the time . The first was written about the Troubles in Northern Ireland , while the last concerns the struggle of a group of women whose children were killed or forcibly disappeared at the hands of the El Salvadoran government during the country 's civil war . The song " Running to Stand Still " from The Joshua Tree was inspired by the heroin addiction that was sweeping through Dublin — the lyric " I see seven towers , but I only see one way out " references the Ballymun Towers of Northern Dublin and the imagery throughout the song personifies the struggles of addiction . 
 Bono 's personal conflicts and turmoil inspired songs like " Mofo " , " Tomorrow " and " Kite " . An emotional yearning or pleading frequently appears as a lyrical theme , in tracks such as " Yahweh " , " Peace on Earth " , and " Please " . Much of U2 's songwriting and music is also motivated by contemplations of loss and anguish , coupled with hopefulness and resiliency , themes that are central to The Joshua Tree . Some of these lyrical ideas have been amplified by Bono and the band 's personal experiences during their youth in Ireland , as well as Bono 's campaigning and activism later in his life . U2 have used tours such as Zoo TV and PopMart to caricature social trends , such as media overload and consumerism , respectively . 
 While the band and its fans often affirm the political nature of their music , U2 's lyrics and music have been criticised as apolitical because of their vagueness and " fuzzy imagery " , and a lack of any specific references to actual people or characters .

 Since the early 1980s , the members of U2 — as a band and individually — have collaborated with other musicians , artists , celebrities , and politicians to address issues concerning poverty , disease , and social injustice . 
 In 1984 , Bono and Adam Clayton participated in Band Aid to raise money for the 1983 – 85 famine in Ethiopia . This initiative produced the hit charity single " Do They Know It 's Christmas ? " , which would be the first among several collaborations between U2 and Bob Geldof . In July 1985 , U2 played Live Aid , a follow @-@ up to Band Aid 's efforts . Bono and his wife Ali , invited by World Vision , later visited Ethiopia where they witnessed the famine first hand . Bono would later say this laid the groundwork for his Africa campaigning and some of his songwriting . 
 In 1986 , U2 participated in the A Conspiracy of Hope tour in support of Amnesty International and in Self Aid for unemployment in Ireland . The same year , Bono and Ali Hewson also visited Nicaragua and El Salvador at the invitation of the Sanctuary movement , and saw the effects of the El Salvador Civil War . These 1986 events greatly influenced The Joshua Tree album , which was being recorded at the time . 
 In 1992 , the band participated in the " Stop Sellafield " concert with Greenpeace during their Zoo TV tour . Events in Sarajevo during the Bosnian War inspired the song " Miss Sarajevo " , which premiered at a September 1995 Pavarotti and Friends show , and which Bono and the Edge performed at War Child . A promise made in 1993 was kept when the band played in Sarajevo as part of 1997 's PopMart Tour . In 1998 , they performed in Belfast days prior to the vote on the Good Friday Agreement , bringing Northern Irish political leaders David Trimble and John Hume on stage to promote the agreement .

 Product Red , a 2006 for @-@ profit brand seeking to raise money for the Global Fund , was founded , in part , by Bono . The ONE Campaign , originally the US counterpart of Make Poverty History , was shaped by his efforts and vision . 
 In late 2005 , following Hurricane Katrina and Hurricane Rita , the Edge helped introduce Music Rising , an initiative to raise funds for musicians who lost their instruments in the storm @-@ ravaged Gulf Coast . In 2006 , U2 collaborated with pop punk band Green Day to record a remake of the song " The Saints Are Coming " by The Skids to benefit Music Rising . A live version of the song recorded at the Louisiana Superdome was released on the single . 
 At the 3rd iHeartRadio Music Awards in April 2016 , U2 were honored with the Innovator Award for " their impact on popular culture and commitment to social causes . " 
 U2 's and Bono 's social activism have not been without its critics , however . Several authors and activists who publish in politically left journals such as <unk> have decried Bono for allowing his celebrity to be co @-@ opted by an association with political figures such as Paul Wolfowitz , as well as his " essential paternalism " . Other news sources have more generally questioned the efficacy of Bono 's campaign to relieve debt and provide assistance to Africa . Tax and development campaigners have also criticised the band 's move from Ireland to the Netherlands to reduce its tax bill .

 = 15th ( Imperial Service ) Cavalry Brigade = 
 The 15th ( Imperial Service ) Cavalry Brigade was a brigade @-@ sized formation that served alongside British Empire forces in the Sinai and Palestine Campaign , during the First World War . Originally called the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade it was formed from Imperial Service Troops provided by the Indian Princely States of Hyderabad , Mysore , Patiala and Jodhpur , which each provided a regiment of lancers . A maximum of three regiments served in the brigade at any one time . The states of Bhavnagar , Kashmir , Kathiawar and Idar provided smaller detachments for the brigade , which was at times reinforced by other British Empire regiments and artillery batteries when on operations . 
 In October 1914 , the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade was moved by sea to Egypt to become part of the Force in Egypt defending the Suez Canal . In the first three years of the war , the soldiers were involved in several small @-@ scale battles connected to the First Suez Offensive , but spent most of their time patrolling in the Sinai Desert and along the west bank of the canal . It was not until November 1917 as part of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force that the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade was involved in the Third Battle of Gaza . The following year the brigade joined the 5th Cavalry Division when it became the 15th ( Imperial Service ) Cavalry Brigade and played an active role in the British victory over Turkish forces in Palestine . 
 In total , eighty @-@ four men from the brigade were killed in action or died of their wounds and another 123 were wounded . Several memorials were erected to commemorate the brigade in the Middle East and in India . The anniversary of the brigade 's most famous victory , the Battle of Haifa , is still celebrated today by its successors in the Indian Army . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1888 , the Indian Government proposed that the independent armies of the Indian Princely states provide the British Empire with troops for service on the North West Frontier and outside the Indian subcontinent . The states ' forces were recognised by the Indian Government and the British Indian Army as allies , and their troops were subject to the Indian Army Act when serving alongside the Indian Army . When in the field , the commander of the British Forces alongside which any Imperial Service Troops were serving was recognised as the higher legal authority in accordance with the act . To eliminate supply problems , states ' armies ' field uniform and weapons were the same as the regular Indian Army , and the Indian Government appointed a staff of officers designated Military Advisers and Assistant Military Advisers to assist the independent states ' rulers in the training and organisation of their forces . Imperial Service Troops were commanded by Indian officers . In contrast , British Indian Army units had British officers in all senior command posts ; their own Indian Viceroy 's commissioned officers were trained to only a troop or platoon level of command . 
 The Imperial Service Troops included cavalry , infantry , artillery , sappers and transport regiments or battalions , with several states contributing both men and equipment . The first states to provide troops for active service were Gwalior and Jaipur for the Chitral Expedition in 1895 . Hyderabad sent troops to Burma in 1898 and to the Second Anglo @-@ Boer War in 1902 . During the 1900 Boxer Rebellion in China , part of the British relief force contingent was an Imperial Service Brigade , raised from the troops of Alwar , Bikaner and Jodhpur . Bikaner also sent troops to serve in the 1901 Somaliland Campaign . By the start of the First World War , the princely states together provided fifteen cavalry regiments , thirteen infantry battalions , seven transport units , four companies of sappers , three camel corps regiments and two batteries of mountain artillery , totalling around 22 @,@ 500 men . 
 = = Brigade organisation = = 
 In October 1914 , under the command of Brigadier @-@ General William A. Watson of the British Indian Army , the Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade , of around 1 @,@ 700 men , was gathered at <unk> for service in the First World War . The brigade headquarters had an establishment of seven officers and forty @-@ seven men . Including the brigade commander there were five British officers on the brigade staff ; also attached were Sir Pratap Singh the Maharaja of Idar and Captain <unk> Singh the Commandant of the Bhavnagar Imperial Service Lancers . The Kathiawar Imperial Service Signal Troop , commanded by Captain Henry St. George Scott of the 4th Gurkha Rifles , were with brigade headquarters , with an establishment of one Indian officer and twenty @-@ seven men of other ranks , including twelve despatch riders from Idar State . The brigade also included the 124th Indian Cavalry Field Ambulance , commanded by Captain T. O 'Leary of the Indian Army Medical Corps , with an establishment of five Indian officers , one British and ten Indians of other ranks . 
 The fighting component of the brigade was formed from three cavalry regiments , each of four squadrons : the 1st Hyderabad Lancers commanded by Major Mahomed <unk> Bahadur with twenty @-@ seven officers ( one British ) and 533 other ranks , the Mysore Lancers ( including two troops of Bhavnagar Lancers and one troop of Kashmir Lancers ) commanded by <unk> B. <unk> Urs Bahadur with thirty @-@ two officers ( one British ) and 487 other ranks , and the Patiala Lancers commanded by Colonel Nand Singh Sardar Bahadur with twenty @-@ six officers and 528 other ranks . This formation remained the same until May 1916 , when the Patiala Lancers were transferred to serve in the campaign in Mesopotamia . The brigade regained its own third regiment in May 1918 when the Jodhpur Lancers , commanded by Colonel Thakur Pratap Singh Sardar Bahadur , which had been serving on the Western Front in France , arrived in the theatre . The final unit assigned to the brigade was the Imperial Service Machine @-@ Gun Squadron formed on 10 June 1918 by amalgamating the three cavalry regiment 's machine @-@ gun sections into one unit . Some sources refer to the squadron as the 15th Imperial Service Brigade Machine @-@ Gun Squadron . 
 Even though the brigade was an Imperial Service unit , the cavalry regiments and brigade headquarters included attached British Indian Army Special Service Officers ( SSO ) , but only as advisors . In 1914 , the three cavalry regiments had two <unk> attached , and Colonel J. <unk> Urs Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Mysore State Forces accompanied the Mysore Lancers as an observer . The Jodhpur Lancers joined the brigade with seven <unk> attached . Throughout the war the establishment of British officers assigned to the cavalry regiments was gradually increased ; in February 1915 there were four in each regiment , in 1917 another two were assigned and in mid @-@ 1918 a full complement of twelve British officers in each of the regiments was reached .
