 The dams on the Willamette 's major tributaries are primarily large flood @-@ control , water storage , and power @-@ generating dams . Thirteen of these dams were built from the 1940s through the 1960s to be operated by the United States Army Corps of Engineers ( USACE ) , and 11 of those produce hydropower . Flood @-@ control dams operated by the USACE are estimated to hold up to 27 percent of the Willamette 's runoff . They are used to regulate river flows so as to cut peaks off floods and increase low flows in late summer and autumn , and to divert water into deeper , narrower channels to prevent flooding . In addition , a relatively small of amount of the water stored in the reservoirs is used for irrigation . 
 Detroit Dam on the North Santiam River is the second tallest dam in the Willamette River basin after Cougar Dam . It is 463 feet ( 141 m ) high and stores 455 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 561 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 m3 ) of water . Lookout Point Dam on the Middle Fork Willamette River , forming Lookout Point Lake , has the largest water storage capacity , at 477 @,@ 700 acre feet ( 589 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 m3 ) . The other 11 dams are Big Cliff on the North Santiam River ; Green Peter and Foster on the Santiam River ; Cougar on the South Fork McKenzie River ; Blue River on the Blue River ; Fern Ridge on the Long Tom River ; Hills Creek , Dexter on the Middle Fork Willamette River ; Fall Creek on Fall Creek ; Cottage Grove on the Coast Fork Willamette River , and <unk> on the Row River . 
 Other major dams in the Willamette watershed are owned by other interests ; for example , several hydroelectric facilities on the Clackamas River are owned by Portland General Electric . They include the River Mill Hydroelectric Project , the Oak Grove project , and the dam at Timothy Lake .

 The 50 or so crossings of the Willamette River include many historic structures , such as the Van Buren Street Bridge , a swing bridge . Built in 1913 , it carries Oregon Route 34 ( Corvallis – Lebanon Highway ) over the river upstream of RM 131 ( RK 211 ) in Corvallis . The machinery to operate the swing span was removed in the 1950s . The Oregon City Bridge , built in 1922 , replaced a suspension span constructed at the site in 1888 . It carries Oregon Route 43 over the river at about RM 26 ( RK 42 ) between Oregon City and West Linn . 
 The Ross Island Bridge carries U.S. Route 26 ( Mount Hood Highway ) over the river at RM 14 ( RK 23 ) . It is one of 10 highway bridges crossing the river in Portland . The 3 @,@ 700 @-@ foot ( 1 @,@ 100 m ) bridge is the only cantilevered deck truss in Oregon . 
 Tilikum Crossing is a 1 @,@ 720 @-@ foot ( 520 m ) cable @-@ stayed bridge that carries public transit , bicycles , and pedestrians but no cars or trucks over the river . It opened for general use on September 12 , 2015 , becoming the first new bridge built across the river in the Portland metropolitan area since 1973 . 
 Further downstream is the oldest remaining highway structure over the Willamette , the Hawthorne Bridge , built in 1910 . It is the oldest vertical @-@ lift bridge in operation in the United States and the oldest highway bridge in Portland . It is also the busiest bicycle and transit bridge in Oregon , with over 8 @,@ 000 cyclists and 800 TriMet buses ( carrying about 17 @,@ 400 riders ) daily . 
 Another historic structure , the Steel Bridge , further downstream , was " the largest telescoping bridge in the world at the time of its opening " in 1912 . It carries trains on its lower deck , MAX ( Metropolitan Area Express ) light @-@ rail trains and motorized vehicles on its upper deck , and foot and bicycle traffic on a cantilevered walkway attached to the lower deck . When small ships must pass under the bridge , its double vertical @-@ lift span can raise a lower railway deck without disturbing traffic on the upper deck . Operators can raise both decks as high as 163 feet ( 50 m ) above the water . The Steel Bridge is " believed to be the world 's only double @-@ lift span that can raise its lower deck independently of the upper deck . " 
 The Broadway Bridge , slightly downstream of the Steel Bridge , was the world 's longest double @-@ leaf bascule drawbridge at the time of its construction in 1913 . Further downstream , the St. Johns Bridge , a steel suspension bridge built in 1931 , replaced the last of the Willamette River ferries in Portland . At about RM 6 ( RK 10 ) , it carries U.S. Route 30 Bypass . The bridge has two Gothic towers supporting the span . The adjacent park and neighborhood of Cathedral Park are named after the Gothic Cathedral @-@ like appearance of the bridge towers . It is the tallest bridge in Portland , with 408 ft ( 122 m ) tall towers and a 205 ft ( 62 m ) navigational clearance . 
 = = Flooding = = 
 Due to the volume and seasonality of precipitation in its valley , the Willamette River has often flooded . In 1861 , rainstorms and warm temperatures combined with a well @-@ above @-@ average snowpack in the Cascades created the largest Willamette River flood in recorded history . An observer of the flood wrote , " The whole Willamette valley [ sic ] was a sheet of water " . From Eugene to Portland , thousands of acres of rich riverside farmland were washed away and many towns in the valley were damaged or destroyed . The " Great Flood " , as it is sometimes called , was massively destructive to human development because most of that development was located in the river 's floodplain . Floodplain locations offer easy access to river transportation and the best soils for farming . The 1861 flood peaked at 635 @,@ 000 cubic feet per second ( 18 @,@ 000 m3 / s ) — more than the Mississippi River usually discharges in the 21st century — and inundated some 353 @,@ 000 acres ( 1 @,@ 430 km2 ) of land . This flood destroyed the town of Linn City . When the flood ended on December 14 , only three homes remained standing in Linn City . No one died in the Linn City flood , but the destruction was simply too great for the town to recover . The citizens gathered what few possessions were not swept away by the floodwaters and moved out of town . Linn City was abandoned . Today the city of West Linn stands about where Linn City once was . 
 In the summer of 1866 , the Willamette was measured at 21 feet ( 6 @.@ 4 m ) above the " low water mark , " and there were more flooding worries . Upstream on the Columbia River , water was also high and the city of The Dalles was nearly flooded . 
 Flooding returned in the winter of early 1890 , when the river first rose very quickly and then fell very quickly . Portland 's main street was completely submerged , communication over the Cascades was cut off , and many rail lines were forced to shut down . In 1894 , another major flood occurred on the Willamette , and although it too caused huge damage , it was not as large as that of 1861 . 
 Throughout the 1940s the Willamette continued to flood its valley . It washed out five bridges in Lane County in December 1942 , caused seven deaths in Portland and forced people in Eugene to evacuate in January 1943 , caused minor flooding in Corvallis in November 1946 , contributed to the destruction of Vanport City and the death of about 15 of its residents in May 1948 , and nearly flooded parts of Salem in December 1948 . 
 Although the Willamette was , by mid @-@ century , heavily engineered and controlled by a complex system of dams , channels , and barriers , it experienced severe floods through the end of the century . Storms caused a major flood that swelled the Willamette and other rivers in the Pacific Northwest from December 1964 through January 1965 , submerging nearly 153 @,@ 000 acres ( 620 km2 ) of land . Before dawn on December 21 , 1964 , the Willamette reached 29 @.@ 4 feet ( 9 @.@ 0 m ) , which was higher than the Portland seawall . By this time , about 15 people had died as a result of the flooding and about 8 @,@ 000 Oregonians had been forced to evacuate their homes in search of other shelter . 
 On December 24 , President Lyndon B. Johnson ordered federal aid for the flooded areas . Meanwhile , the Willamette continued to rise . In the next couple of days , the river receded , but on December 27 , it was at 29 @.@ 8 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) , which was still nearly 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) above the flood stage . The Willamette continued to pose flooding threats through January 1965 , and more stormy weather occurred along the Pacific Coast . 
 In February 1996 , very heavy warm rains driven by a subtropical jet stream fell on a high , water @-@ heavy snowpack in the Willamette watershed . These conditions , similar to those that caused the 1861 flood , caused some of the costliest flooding in the river 's recorded history . An Associated Press journalist wrote , " The river crested at one town after another — at Corvallis 3 ½ feet above flood stage , Oregon City 18 feet above , Portland 10 @.@ 5 feet above — much like a meal moving through a boa constrictor . " The flood was serious enough to interrupt the progress of Oregon 's growing economy , but the inundated acreage was smaller than in 1964 — only about 117 @,@ 000 acres ( 470 km2 ) . 
 About 450 concrete flood @-@ protection walls in Portland that had been constructed during the February flood , each weighing about 5 @,@ 500 pounds ( 2 @,@ 500 kg ) , were removed in April . In October , they were replaced by a larger steel wall that cost the city about $ 300 @,@ 000 . The new wall had 0 @.@ 25 @-@ inch ( 6 @.@ 4 mm ) removable steel plates designed to better prevent future flooding . 
 = = Pollution = = 
 Since as early as 1869 , with the introduction of a federally funded " snag puller " designed to keep the waterway clear , human habitation has affected the ecology of the river basin . The construction of large federal dams on the Willamette 's tributaries between 1941 and 1969 damaged the spawning grounds for spring Chinook salmon and steelhead . Domestic and industrial waste from the cities built up along the river , " essentially turning the main @-@ stem river into an open sewer by the 1920s . " 
 A 1927 City Club of Portland report labeled the waterway " filthy and ugly " , and identified the City of Portland as the worst offender . The Oregon Anti @-@ Stream Pollution League brought a pollution @-@ abatement measure before the 39th Oregon Legislative Assembly in 1937 . The bill passed , but Governor Charles Martin vetoed it . The Izaak Walton League and the Oregon affiliate of the National Wildlife Federation countered the governor 's veto with a ballot initiative , which passed in November 1938 . 
 Shortly after he was elected in 1966 , Governor Tom McCall ordered water quality tests on the Willamette , conducted his own research on the water quality , and became head of the Oregon State Sanitary Authority . McCall learned that the river was heavily polluted in Portland . In a television documentary , Pollution in Paradise , he said that " the Willamette River was actually cleaner when the Oregon Sanitary Authority was created in 1938 than it was in 1962 . " He then discouraged tourism in the state and made it harder for companies to qualify for a permit to operate near the river . He also regulated how much those companies could pollute and closed plants that did not meet state pollution standards . 
 Despite earlier cleanup efforts , state studies in the 1990s identified a wide variety of pollutants in the river bottom , including heavy metals , polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , and pesticides along the lower 12 miles ( 19 km ) of the river , in Portland . As a result , this section of the river was designated a Superfund site in 2000 , involving the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) in cleanup of the river bottom . The initial cleanup is focused on the portion between Swan Island and Sauvie Island . Pollution is exacerbated by combined sewer overflows , which the city has greatly reduced through its Big Pipe Project . Further upstream , the pressing environmental issues have mainly been variations in pH and dissolved oxygen . The Willamette is nevertheless clean enough to be used by cities such as Corvallis and Wilsonville for drinking water . 
 Since pollution concerns are primarily along the lower river , the Willamette in general scores relatively high on the Oregon Water Quality Index ( OWQI ) , which is compiled by the Oregon Department of Environmental Quality ( DEQ ) . The DEQ considers index scores of less than 60 to be very poor ; the other categories are 60 – 79 ( poor ) ; 80 – 84 ( fair ) ; 85 – 89 ( good ) , and 90 – 100 ( excellent ) . The Willamette River 's water quality is rated excellent near the source , though it gradually declines to fair near the mouth . Between 1998 and 2007 , the average score for the upper Willamette at Springfield ( RM 185 , RK 298 ) was 93 . At Salem ( RM 84 , RK 135 ) , the score was 89 , and good scores continued all the way to the Hawthorne Bridge in Portland ( RM 13 , RK 21 ) at 85 . Scores were in the " fair " category further downstream ; the least favorable reading was at the Swan Island Channel midpoint ( RM 0 @.@ 5 , RK 0 @.@ 8 ) at 81 . By comparison , sites on the <unk> River , the Clackamas , and the North Santiam all scored 95 , and a site at a pump station on Klamath Strait Drain between Upper Klamath Lake and Lower Klamath Lake recorded the lowest score in Oregon at 19 .

 Over the past 150 years , a significant change for the Willamette River has been the loss of its floodplain forests , which covered an estimated 89 percent of a 400 @-@ foot ( 120 m ) band along each river bank in 1850 . By 1990 only 37 percent of this zone was forested ; the rest had been converted to farm fields or cleared for urban or suburban uses . The remaining forests close to the river include large stands of black cottonwood , Oregon ash , willow , and bigleaf maple . The central valley — a former perennial grass prairie interspersed with oaks , ponderosa pines , and other trees — is devoted almost entirely to farming . Douglas fir , western hemlock , and western red cedar dominate the forest on the Coast Range side of the basin . Forests to the east in the Cascade Range include Pacific silver fir as well as western hemlock and western red cedar . 
 Fish in the Willamette basin include 31 native species , among them cutthroat , bull , and rainbow trout , several species of salmon , sucker , minnow , sculpin , and lamprey , as well as sturgeon , stickleback , and others . Among the 29 non @-@ native species in the basin , there are brook , brown , and lake trout , largemouth and smallmouth bass , walleye , carp , bluegill , and others . In addition to fish , the basin supports 18 species of amphibians , such as the Pacific giant salamander . Beaver and river otter are among 69 mammal species living in the watershed , also frequented by 154 bird species , such as the American dipper , osprey , and harlequin duck . Garter snakes are among the 15 species of reptiles found in the basin . 
 Species diversity is greatest along the lower river and its tributaries . Threatened , endangered , or sensitive species include spring Chinook salmon , winter steelhead , chum salmon , Coho salmon and Oregon chub . In the central valley , several projects have been done to restore and protect wetlands in order to provide habitat for bald eagles , Fender 's blue butterfly ( of which 6 @,@ 000 remain ) , Oregon chub , Bradshaw 's desert parsley , a variety of Willamette <unk> , and Kincaid 's lupine . In the early 21st century , osprey populations are increasing along the river , possibly because of a ban on the pesticide DDT and on the birds ' ability to use power poles for nesting . Beaver populations , presumed to be much lower than historic levels , are increasing throughout the basin . 
 = Widerstehe doch der Sünde , BWV 54 = 
 Widerstehe doch der Sünde ( Just resist sin ) , BWV 54 , is a church cantata by Johann Sebastian Bach . He composed the solo cantata for alto in Weimar between 1711 and 1714 , and probably performed it on the seventh Sunday after Trinity , 15 July 1714 . It is Bach 's first extant church cantata for a solo voice . 
 The text of the short work was written by Georg Christian Lehms , for two arias and a connecting recitative . The topic is to resist sin , based on the Epistle of James . The text was published in a 1711 collection , dedicated to the Sunday Oculi . It is not known when Bach composed the work but is assumed that he performed it as part of his monthly cantata productions in 1714 on the seventh Sunday after Trinity , 15 July . The solo voice is accompanied by strings : two violin parts , two viola parts and continuo . The composition begins with a striking dissonant chord . 
 = = History and words = = 
 The history of the composition is not clear . The text was written by Georg Christian Lehms for Oculi , the third Sunday in Lent , and published in 1711 in Gottgefälliges Kirchen @-@ Opffer . It concentrates on avoiding sin , based on the Epistle of James . The first line of movement 3 quotes 1 John 3 : 8 . Bach may have composed the cantata already before taking up regular cantata compositions in Weimar . He was appointed concertmaster of the Weimar court capelle of the co @-@ reigning dukes Wilhelm Ernst and Ernst August of Saxe @-@ Weimar , on 2 March 1714 . As concertmaster , he assumed the principal responsibility for composing new works , specifically cantatas for the Schlosskirche ( palace church ) , on a monthly schedule . 
 The Bach scholar Alfred Dürr suggested that Bach performed the cantata for the Seventh Sunday after Trinity of 1714 . The prescribed readings for the Sunday are from the Epistle to the Romans , " the wages of sin is death ; but the gift of God is eternal life " ( Romans 6 : 19 – 23 ) , and from the Gospel of Mark , the feeding of the 4000 ( Mark 8 : 1 – 9 ) . The cantata text relates to the epistle of both Sundays , but shows no connection to either Gospel . 
 While Dürr assumes that Bach first performed the cantata on 15 July 1714 , other scholars arrive at different dates . John Eliot Gardiner and others assume Oculi that year which would make it the earliest cantata performed after the promotion . It is his first extant church cantata for a solo voice , followed by Mein Herze schwimmt im Blut , BWV 199 , for soprano . The cantata is the first of four written for a single alto soloist , the others , all composed in 1726 , being Geist und Seele wird verwirret , BWV 35 , Vergnügte Ruh , beliebte Seelenlust , BWV 170 , and Gott soll allein mein Herze haben , BWV 169 , two of which also have texts by Lehms . 
 There is some debate what sort of singer might have been the intended or actual first performer of Widerstehe doch der Sünde , especially given its low range and tessitura compared with other Alto solo writing by Bach such as Geist und Seele wird verwirret , BWV 35 or Vergnügte Ruh , beliebte Seelenlust , BWV 170 . If the cantata was written early in Bach 's ( second ) Weimar period , then perhaps the soloist could have been Adam Immanuel Weldig , the only falsettist in the Weimar court chapel in 1708 ( the other five singers being a bass , two tenors and two teenage <unk> ) . However , Weldig 's designation as " falsettist " may indicate that he was a soprano and not an alto . Weldig left Weimar in 1713 so could not have sung if the first performance was as late as 1714 as suggested by Dürr . Nowadays the solo part in this cantata is usually taken by a contralto or countertenor . 
 = = Scoring and structure = = 
 The cantata , structured in three movements , is scored as chamber music for a solo alto voice , two violins ( Vl ) , two violas ( Va ) , and basso continuo ( Bc ) . The duration is given as 14 minutes . The manuscript title page reads : " <unk> 2 Violini , 2 Viole , Alto , Solo , è Cont . : del <unk> " . 
 In the following table of the movements , the scoring follows the Neue Bach @-@ Ausgabe . The keys and time signatures are taken from Alfred Dürr , using the symbols for common time ( 4 / 4 ) and alla breve ( 2 / 2 ) . The continuo , playing throughout , is not shown .

 The first movement , " Widerstehe doch der Sünde " ( Just resist sin ) is a da capo aria , which opens with a surprising dissonance and leaves its key of E @-@ flat major open until a cadence in measure 8 . Dürr describes it as a call to resistance and compares it to the beginning of the recitative " Siehe , ich stehe vor der Tür " , a call to be ready , in the cantata for Advent Nun komm , der Heiden Heiland , BWV 61 , composed in 1714 . Gardiner comments : " It is a deliberate shock tactic to rouse his listeners to the need to ' stand firm against all sinning , or its poison will possess you ' " . Bach used the first aria again in his St Mark Passion . 
 = = = 2 = = = 
 The recitative " Die Art <unk> Sünden " ( The way of vile sins ) is secco , accompanied by the continuo . The words " So <unk> sich nur ein <unk> Schatten und <unk> Grab " ( It shows itself as only an empty shadow and a whitewashed grave ) are expressed in " pale " harmonies . The final lines are arioso and illustrate in " Sie ist als wie ein <unk> <unk> , das uns durch Leib und Seele <unk> " ( It is like a sharp sword , that pierces through body and soul ) the movement of the sword by fast runs in the continuo .

 The final aria " Wer Sünde tut , der ist vom Teufel " ( He who sins is of the devil ) is again a da capo aria , but shows elements of a four @-@ part fugue for the voice , the violins in unison , the violas in unison and the continuo .

 = Boulonnais horse = 
 The Boulonnais , also known as the " White Marble Horse " , is a draft horse breed . It is known for its large but elegant appearance and is usually gray , although chestnut and black are also allowed by the French breed registry . Originally there were several sub @-@ types , but they were crossbred until only one is seen today . The breed 's origins trace to a period before the Crusades and , during the 17th century , Spanish Barb , Arabian , and Andalusian blood were added to create the modern type . 
 During the early 1900s , the Boulonnais were imported in large numbers to the United States and were quite popular in France ; however , the European population suffered severe decreases during 20th @-@ century wars . The breed nearly became extinct following World War II , but rebounded in France in the 1970s as a popular breed for horse meat . Breed numbers remain low ; it is estimated that fewer than 1 @,@ 000 horses remain in Europe , mostly in France , with a few in other nations . Studies as early as 1983 indicated a danger of inbreeding within the Boulonnais population , and a 2009 report suggested that the breed should be a priority for conservation within France . The smallest type of Boulonnais was originally used to pull carts full of fresh fish from Boulogne to Paris , while the larger varieties performed heavy draft work , both on farms and in the cities . The Boulonnais was also crossbred to create and refine several other draft breeds . 
 = = Breed characteristics = = 
 The Boulonnais today stands from 14 @.@ 3 to 16 @.@ 3 hands ( 59 to 67 inches , 150 to 170 cm ) or more . It has a short , elegant head with a broad forehead and a short , muscular neck . Members of the breed have full chests , rounded rib cages and sloping shoulders . The legs are fairly short but robust and strong . Unlike other draft breeds such as the Shire or Clydesdale , it has no heavy feathering on its lower legs . The breed is generally branded with a small anchor mark on the left side of the neck . Due mostly to the many additions of Oriental blood , the Boulonnais has an elegant appearance that is not often seen in heavy draft breeds and it has been called " Europe 's noblest draft horse " . The fineness of the skin and delicate appearance of the veins has allowed the horse to be described as looking " like polished marble " , leading to its " White Marble Horse " nickname . 
 In 1778 , the French National Stud performed an initial survey of the breed and found that most were black or dark bay . During the 1800s , gray horses began to appear , and it was the predominating color by the end of the century . Gray became a popular color during this time due to the use of the horses to haul fish at night – gray horses were more visible in the dark , and therefore more valuable . In the later years of the 20th century , breeders again began to prefer darker colors such as bay and chestnut . Today , chestnut , gray and black are the only colors allowed by the French breed registry , with the vast majority of horses being gray – a popular phrase says that the horses have coats " the color of the clouds from the coast " . 
 = = = Sub @-@ types = = = 
 There were originally several types of Boulonnais . The Petit Boulonnais , <unk> or <unk> was used in the rapid transport of cartloads of fresh fish ( la <unk> ) from the Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais to Paris ; it stood 15 @.@ 1 to 15 @.@ 3 hands ( 61 to 63 inches , 155 to 160 cm ) and weighed 1 @,@ 210 to 1 @,@ 430 pounds ( 550 to 650 kg ) . The Picard draft came from the Picardy region , and was called the " horse of the bad land " , in comparison to the <unk> horse from the Pays de Caux area , which was called the " horse of the good land " . The " grand Boulonnais " , which stood 15 @.@ 3 to 16 @.@ 3 hands ( 63 to 67 inches , 160 to 170 cm ) high and weighed 1 @,@ 430 to 1 @,@ 650 pounds ( 650 to 750 kg ) , was bred in the 19th century for farm work in the sugar beet fields . All of these types were bred together to create the modern Boulonnais horse . 
 = = History = = 
 One theory states that the origins of the Boulonnais breed emerged from the crossbreeding of native French mares and stallions brought by the Numidian army in 55 – 54 BC . However , many equine scholars are skeptical of this theory , and state that , whatever the early origins , the later selective breeding and local climate and soil types had a greater influence on the breed than any early Oriental blood . During the Crusades , two breeders , Eustache , Comte de Boulogne , and later Robert , Comte d 'Artois , wanted to create a fast , agile , and strong warhorse for knights to ride in battle . They crossed the existing heavy French stallions with German <unk> mares , similar to modern @-@ day Hanoverians . During the 17th @-@ century Spanish occupation of Flanders , a mixture of Spanish Barb , Arabian , and Andalusian blood was added to the breed , to create the modern Boulonnais . By the 17th century , horse dealers were coming into the Boulonnais district from Picardy and Upper Normandy to buy local horses , which enjoyed a good reputation among breeders . From the late 18th through the mid @-@ 19th century , the Boulonnais spread across France and Europe ; during this time , the breed increased in size as the Industrial Revolution called for larger horses that retained the active movement of the original type . Beginning in the 1830s , it was proposed to cross the Arabian with the Boulonnais to create a new type of cavalry horse , and in the 1860s , calls were put forth to add Thoroughbred blood for the same reason . However , breeders rejected these calls , stating that using the breed to create cavalry horses would make them poorer draft horses . Breed societies also discouraged crosses between the Boulonnais and the Brabant . In June 1886 , a studbook was created for the breed in France , and placed under the jurisdiction of the Syndicat Hippique Boulonnais ( <unk> ) in 1902 . 
 During the early 20th century , the Boulonnais was imported into the United States in large numbers , where it was registered along with other French heavy horse breeds as the " French draft horse " . Breed members in the United States were registered with the Anglo @-@ Norman Horse Association ( or National Norman Horse Association ) beginning in 1876 , an association that was renamed the National French Draft Association in 1885 . This association declared in 1876 that the Boulonnais , Norman , Percheron and Picardy breeds were all essentially the same , and should all be known as the " Norman horse " . They later declared that all of the " Norman horses " were in fact " Percherons " , regardless of actual breeding . This was mostly designed to sell mixed breed draft horses to American consumers at higher prices , and the Illinois Board of Agriculture soon ruled that only those Percherons who came from proven Percheron stock were to be registered as such , and all other breeds , including the Boulonnais , were to be considered separately . Boulonnais were exported from France to Austria , although they saw little success there , and breeding stallions were sent to Argentina . 
 = = = 20th century and today = = = 
 The Boulonnais was once a popular workhorse in France , with an estimated population of over 600 @,@ 000 in the early 1900s . World War I and World War II almost destroyed the breed , as its home area saw heavy combat in both wars and the bands of broodmares were scattered . Between World War II and the 1970s , the breed almost became extinct , and only a few breeders kept it alive . In the 1970s , it became popular for horse meat , and consumers considered it to be some of the best meat available . However , by this point , there were fewer than 1 @,@ 000 mares remaining . During the mid @-@ 20th century , the stallions Fréthun ( foaled in 1949 ) , Select ( 1962 ) , Trésor ( 1963 ) , <unk> ( 1966 ) and Prince ( 1981 ) had a strong influence on the breed , although this contributed to the problem of inbreeding . Fréthun genes are found in 14 percent of the pedigrees of Boulonnais living today . In the early 1970s , Henry Blanc , the newly appointed director of the French National Stud , proposed that nine draft horse breeds , including the Boulonnais , be recategorized from pulling horses to meat horses . When enacted , this <unk> helped to preserve the gene pool of the Boulonnais by encouraging breeding , but it also changed its primary purpose , resulting in a dramatic weight increase by the 1980s . 
 The Boulonnais is still bred in small numbers , with the American Boulonnais Horse Association estimating a population of fewer than 1 @,@ 000 animals remaining in Europe . Many studs are government @-@ funded , to prevent the breed from dying out . The majority of the breed , 95 percent , are located in the Nord @-@ Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais and Normandy regions and 75 percent in just the Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais department of Nord @-@ Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais alone . Although most Boulonnais are in France , a few are exported . In 1999 , fifteen foals were exported to Brazil and one stallion to Argentina . On average , a little over a dozen horses a year are exported , mainly to Brazil and Belgium for breeding and to Germany for forestry work . A few horses live in the Netherlands , Switzerland and Luxembourg , as well as in North America . Since 2006 , twenty horses , including two registry @-@ approved breeding stallions , have been exported from France to Denmark to create a stud farm in that country . 
 The French national stud , the Haras Nationaux , allows the registration of horses bred using artificial insemination and embryo transfer , but does not allow the registration of cloned horses . It considers the breed to be endangered , along with several other French draft breeds . A 2009 study of French equine genetics proposed that the Boulonnais , along with four other French breeds , should be a conservation priority , with a goal of maintaining maximum genetic variability in France 's native horse population . This follows from studies done as early as 1983 that showed inbreeding and a lack of genetic diversity in the breed .

 During the 17th century , the smaller <unk> type was used for transporting fresh fish from Boulogne to Paris , a distance of almost 200 miles , in under 18 hours . This journey is remembered annually in the Route du Poisson race . Only mares pulled small carts full of ice and fish on the relay @-@ style trip . By 1884 , the Boulonnais was called the " largest and most valuable of that kind of horse in France " . At that time , they were used to move heavy blocks of building stone in Paris , with six to eight horses drawing blocks of several tons . During the 20th century , the larger Boulonnais type was utilized by the French army , and highly regarded for its ability to pull artillery and supply wagons . Falling demand for the breed means that today it is bred mainly for horsemeat . In 2010 , 60 percent of Boulonnais horses bred in France were intended for slaughter , and 80 percent of these were exported , mainly to Italy , to be fattened before being sent to slaughterhouses . However , the sector is in crisis due to falling prices , controversy and the importation of cheap meat ; despite a resurgence following the Mad Cow scares of the 1990s , the consumption of horse meat has fallen sharply , although the Nord @-@ Pas @-@ de @-@ Calais region remains the largest consumer of horse meat in France . 
 The Boulonnais provided part of the base for the Anglo @-@ Norman breed , which was later to play a large role in the creation of the Selle Francais . It was also used in the creation and refinement of the Italian Heavy Draft , the post @-@ World War II improvement of the Schleswig horse , and the creation of the early 19th @-@ century Ardennes . Some equine scholars theorize that if the smaller <unk> had survived , it would have been an ideal horse to cross with the Thoroughbred or Anglo @-@ Arabian to produce a warmblood for competition . In France , a breeding program has been developed by the National Stud to cross Boulonnais and Arabian horses to create a fast , alert driving horse , called the <unk> . This breeding program also brings new blood into the Boulonnais line as , if an <unk> mare is bred to a Boulonnais stallion , and a resulting filly is bred to another Boulonnais stallion , the third generation horse may be inducted into the purebred Boulonnais studbook if it passes an inspection .

 = 1911 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 1911 Atlantic hurricane season was relatively inactive , with only six known tropical cyclones forming in the Atlantic during the summer and fall . There were three suspected tropical depressions , including one that began the season in February and one that ended the season when it dissipated in December . Three storms intensified into hurricanes , two of which attained Category 2 status on the modern @-@ day Saffir – Simpson Hurricane Scale . Storm data is largely based on the Atlantic hurricane database , which underwent a thorough revision for the period between 1911 and 1914 in 2005 . 
 Most of the cyclones directly impacted land . A westward @-@ moving hurricane killed 17 people and severely damaged Charleston , South Carolina , and the surrounding area in late August . A couple of weeks earlier , the Pensacola , Florida area had a storm in the Gulf of Mexico that produced winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) over land . The fourth storm of the season struck the coast of Nicaragua , killing 10 and causing extensive damage . 
 = = Season summary = = 
 The Atlantic hurricane database ( HURDAT ) officially recognizes six tropical cyclones from the 1911 season . Only three attained hurricane status , with winds of 75 mph ( 121 km / h ) or greater . The third hurricane of the season was the most intense storm , with a minimum central air pressure of 972 mbar ( 28 @.@ 7 inHg ) . A week after its dissipation , another hurricane formed with wind speeds that matched the previous storm , but with unknown air pressure . Three weak tropical depressions developed and remained below tropical storm force ; the first formed in February and the third in December . The first storm to reach tropical storm intensity developed on August 4 , and the final tropical storm of the year dissipated on October 31 . 
 The early 1900s lacked modern forecasting and documentation . The hurricane database from these years is sometimes found to be incomplete or incorrect , and new storms are continually being added as part of the ongoing Atlantic hurricane reanalysis . The period from 1911 through 1914 was reanalyzed in 2005 . Two previously unknown tropical cyclones were identified using records including historical weather maps and ship reports , and information on the known storms was amended and corrected . These storms are referred to simply by their number in chronological order , since tropical cyclones in the Atlantic Ocean were not given official names until much later . 
 = = Timeline = = 
 = = Storms = = 
 = = = Tropical Storm One = = = 
 Identified by its lack of associated frontal boundaries and closed circulation center , the first tropical cyclone of the 1911 season formed on August 4 over southern Alabama in the United States . At only tropical depression strength , it tracked eastward and emerged into the Atlantic Ocean the next day . Several days later , while located near Bermuda , the depression became a tropical storm and turned northeastward . The storm lasted several more days until dissipating on August 11 . The storm produced heavy rainfall on the Bermuda , but no gale @-@ force winds were reported . The storm was unknown until the 2005 Atlantic hurricane database revision recognized it as a tropical storm . 
 = = = Hurricane Two = = = 
 Based on ship observations in the southeastern Gulf of Mexico , a low @-@ pressure area developed north of Key West in early August . It developed into a tropical depression at 12 : 00 UTC on August 8 , and strengthened into a tropical storm at 06 : 00 UTC on August 9 while moving northwestward off the west coast of Florida . Gradual intensification continued , and at 06 : 00 UTC on August 11 the storm strengthened to hurricane status . At 22 : 00 UTC on August 11 , the hurricane reached its peak intensity and concurrently made landfall near the border between Alabama and Florida as a small tropical cyclone . During this time , the storm 's maximum sustained winds were estimated at 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) , making it the equivalent of a Category 1 hurricane on the modern day Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . A lull in the storm accompanied the nearby passage of its eye before conditions once again deteriorated . Although the lowest barometric pressure measured on land was 1007 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 74 inHg ) in Pensacola , Florida , the storm 's pressure was estimated to be much lower at 982 mbar ( hPa : 29 @.@ 00 inHg ) . After making landfall , the hurricane weakened and slowly drifted westward , weakening to a tropical depression over Louisiana on August 13 , before dissipating over Arkansas by 12 : 00 UTC the next day . 
 While developing in the Gulf of Mexico , the tropical cyclone brought light rainfall to Key West , amounting to 1 @.@ 82 in ( 46 mm ) over two days . The hurricane 's outer rainbands affected the Florida panhandle as early as August 10 , producing winds as strong as 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) in Pensacola , where it was considered the worst since 1906 . During the afternoon of August 11 , the United States Weather Bureau issued storm warnings for coastal areas of the gulf coast where the hurricane was expected to impact . Upon making landfall , the storm brought heavy precipitation , peaking at 10 in ( 250 mm ) in Molino , Florida , although the heaviest rainfall was localized from Mississippi to central Alabama . Some washouts occurred during brief episodes of heavy rain as the storm drifted westward after landfall . Strong winds in the Pensacola area downed telecommunication lines and disrupted power , cutting off communication to outside areas for 24 hours . A pavilion on Santa Rosa Island had a third of its roof torn , and some other buildings inland were also unroofed . Offshore , twelve barges were grounded after being swept by the rough surf . Heavy losses were reported to timber after they were swept away when log booms failed . Damage figures from the Pensacola area were conservatively estimated at US $ 12 @,@ 600 , considered lighter than expected , and there were some deaths . 
 = = = Hurricane Three = = = 
 Over a week after the dissipation of the previous hurricane , the third storm of the season developed on August 23 and slowly tracked west @-@ northwestward . After attaining hurricane status , the storm turned more towards the northwest , and several days later reached its peak wind speeds of 100 mph ( 155 km / h ) ; a barometric pressure of 972 mbar ( hPa ) was reported . The center passed inland a few miles south of Savannah , Georgia , on August 28 ; upon making landfall , the hurricane rapidly degenerated . It deteriorated into a tropical depression on August 29 and persisted over land until dissipating a couple of days later . 
 The hurricane , relatively small in size , caused widespread damage between Savannah and Charleston , South Carolina . Savannah itself received only minor damage , although the storm 's center passed close by . Along the coast of Georgia , torrential rainfall caused numerous washouts on railroads . Crops , livestock and roads in the area took heavy damage . At Charleston , winds were estimated at 106 mph ( 171 km / h ) after an anemometer , last reporting 94 mph ( 151 km / h ) , failed , and 4 @.@ 90 in ( 124 mm ) of precipitation fell over three days . 
 The storm raged for more than 36 hours , causing severe damage ; the winds unroofed hundreds of buildings , demolished many houses and had an extensive impact on power and telephone services . Tides 10 @.@ 6 ft ( 3 @.@ 2 m ) above normal left a " confused mass of wrecked vessels and damaged wharfs " , according to a local forecaster in Charleston , while six navy torpedo boats were ripped from their moorings and blown ashore . In total , 17 people were killed in the hurricane , and property damage in Charleston was estimated at $ 1 million ( 1911 USD , $ 25 @.@ 4 million 2014 USD ) . 
 = = = Hurricane Four = = = 
 The next storm formed well to the east of the Lesser Antilles on September 3 and moved westward , attaining tropical storm status about a day later . The storm slowed and curved toward the southwest , nearing the northern coast of Colombia before pulling away from land and strengthening into a hurricane . It further intensified to Category 2 status before striking Nicaragua on September 10 . Quickly weakening to a tropical storm , the cyclone continued westward across Central America and briefly entered the eastern Pacific Ocean . It dissipated shortly thereafter . In the town of Corinto , a report indicated the deaths of 10 people and 50 additional injuries . About 250 houses were destroyed , leaving approximately $ 2 million ( 1911 USD , $ 50 @.@ 8 million 2014 USD ) in damage . Data on this storm is extremely scarce ; as such , only minor revisions could be made to its chronology in the hurricane database . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Five = = = 
 The fifth official tropical cyclone of the year was also previously unknown until contemporary reassessments . It exhibited some hybrid characteristics , and may have qualified for subtropical cyclone status according to the modern classification scheme . On September 15 , the storm formed over the central Atlantic and initially moved westward . It gradually intensified as it turned northwestward , and on September 19 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone southeast of New England . The system was subsequently absorbed by a more powerful frontal boundary approaching from the northwest . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Six = = = 
 The final storm was first observed as a disturbance near Puerto Rico in the Caribbean Sea in late October . The disturbance was the precursor to a tropical depression which developed over the southern Bahamas and headed west @-@ southwestward across Cuba , where , at Havana , winds blew from the southeast at 44 mph ( 71 km / h ) . It became a tropical storm on October 27 and drifted southwestward . Near the eastern tip of the Yucatán Peninsula , the storm turned sharply northward . An area of high pressure over the United States prevented the cyclone from turning eastward toward Florida , and it continued into the Gulf of Mexico . However , on October 31 , the storm curved eastward and moved ashore over northern Florida . The storm decreased in intensity as it passed into the Atlantic . The storm 's circulation center remained poorly defined throughout its course . It was long believed to have developed south of Cuba , although a reevaluation of ship data indicated the depression had actually formed east of the island . On October 26 , the Weather Bureau hoisted hurricane warnings along the east coast of Florida from Key West to West Palm Beach , and on the west coast up to Tampa . 
 = = = Tropical depressions = = = 
 In addition to the six officially recognized tropical storms and hurricanes , three tropical depressions in the 1911 season have been identified . The first developed in February from a trough of low pressure in the open Atlantic and progressed westward . Although a ship dubiously reported winds of over 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) in association with the system , a lack of supporting evidence precludes its designation as a tropical storm . The cyclone dissipated by February 21 . The second depression evolved from an extratropical cyclone in mid- to late May , becoming a tropical cyclone on May 22 northeast of Bermuda . It persisted for three days as it meandered around the same general area before being absorbed by another non @-@ tropical storm . The modern @-@ day documentation of this system was also hindered by a lack of data . On December 11 , the third tropical depression formed near the Turks and Caicos Islands . It progressed westward and was situated just north of eastern Cuba the next day . The system began to weaken on December 13 and dissipated shortly thereafter . 
 = Kabandha = 
 In Hindu mythology , Kabandha ( <unk> ् <unk> , Kabandha , lit . " headless torso " ) is a Rakshasa ( demon ) who is killed and freed from a curse by the god Rama – an Avatar of Vishnu – and his brother Lakshmana . Kabandha 's legend appears in the Hindu epics Ramayana and Mahabharata , as well as in later Ramayana adaptations . 
 Kabandha was a gandharva ( celestial musician ) named Vishvavasu or Danu , who was cursed and made into an ugly , carnivorous demon by Indra , the king of the gods , and / or a sage . In an encounter with Rama and Lakshmana , the brothers sever his arms and proceed to cremate his corpse . Upon his death , Kabandha resumes his gandharva form and directs Rama to the Rsyamukha mountain , where the exiled monkey @-@ chief Sugriva is hiding . Kabandha advises Rama to form an alliance with Sugriva , who would be of assistance in the search for Rama 's wife Sita , who had been kidnapped by Ravana , the demon @-@ king of Lanka . Following Kabandha 's instructions , Rama befriends Sugriva and rescues Sita with his help . 
 = = Literary sources = = 
 The most detailed account of Kabandha appears in the third book , Aranya kanda , of the 4th century BCE epic Ramayana , <unk> ( cantos ) 69 @-@ 73 . However , Kabandha first appears in canto one of the first book Bala kanda of the Ramayana , in which the entire story is summarized . 
 The account of Kabandha also appears in the <unk> – the retelling of Rama 's story in the Aranya Parva – the third book of the Mahabharata ( composed over a period of 200 years , 5th century BCE to 3rd century BCE ) , and its appendix Harivamsa , as well as in later adaptations of the Ramayana such as Kalidasa 's Raghuvamsa ( composed between 4th to 6th century CE ) , Bhatti 's 7th century work Bhattikavya , Bhavabhuti 's 8th century play <unk> , Murari Mishra 's 10th century drama Anargharaghava , Kamban 's 12th century book Kamba Ramayana , Adhyatma Ramayana ( chapter 9 of Aranya kanda , dated between late 14th to early 15th century ) from Brahmanda Purana and Tulsidas 's 16th century work Ramacharitamanas . 
 = = Early life and curse = = 
 The Ramayana narrates : Kabandha was born as a gandharva ( celestial musician ) named Vishvavasu . He was the son of the gandharva Sri Vishvavasu or Sri and was also known as Danu ( <unk> ) . Vishvavasu performed penance and got the boon of immortality from the creator @-@ god Brahma . He became arrogant due to his boon and attacked Indra , the god @-@ king of heaven . Indra used his celestial weapon the Vajra ( thunderbolt ) and drove Vishvavasu 's head and thighs into his body . Vishvavasu pleaded that he be given a way to find and eat food . Upon Vishvavasu 's beseeching , Indra gave him two long arms and a mouth on his belly . Indra also decreed that Kabandha would regain his original form when Rama severs his arms . 
 The Ramayana further adds : Kabandha spent his days near the hermitage of the sage Matanga in the Krauncha forest . There , he spent his time scaring sages . Once , Kabandha attacked the sage <unk> , who cursed him to remain in his hideous form for eternity . Upon Kabandha 's pleading , the sage reduced his curse and said that Kabandha would be freed of his form , once Rama and Lakshmana sever his arms . So Kabandha waited in that forest for Rama 's arrival . <unk> suspected the tale to be a later interpolation arguing that it does not appear in all versions / translations of the original Ramayana . 
 The Adhyatma Ramayana tells that Kabandha ( the name Vishvavasu is not used ) was a Gandharva chief , who was blessed by Brahma with immortality . He was " drunk with the wine of youth and beauty " and used to roam the universe enchanting beautiful maidens . Once , he laughed at the sage Ashtavakra ( " one who was eight deformities " ) , who cursed him to become a Rakshasa , though the sage assured him that Rama would free him of the curse . Still arrogant , Kabandha once chased Indra . The rest of the Indra episode mirrors the Ramayana telling . 
 The Mahabharata tells that Kabandha was a gandharva named Vishvavasu in his previous life and was cursed by Brahma to be born " from a Rakshasa womb " . The Mahavira @-@ charita calls Kabandha 's real form Danu , son of Sri . The Bhattikavya does not explicitly name Kabandha . He is introduced as " a dreadful demon that was always hungry and being endowed with long arms " . Later , he is identified as Sri 's son , who was cursed by an ascetic . The Ramacharitamanas tells that Kabandha was cursed by the sage Durvasa , who is known for his hot temper in Hindu mythology . 
 = = Etymology and description of the demonic form = = 
 The Mahabharata describes him thus : Kabandha was " as big as a mountain , dark as a black cloud , with pointed hairs all over his body and looked fierce with a voice as loud as thunder . He had an eye on his stomach , round and yellow , emitting a glare like a fire @-@ name . Looking wicked he thrust his big tongue out of his huge mouth licking the sides . " The Ramayana presents a similar description of Kabandha . Kabandha had a broad chest and was without a head or neck . He had only one eye on his chest and a mouth on his belly . He used his long arms to draw his prey closer . Kabandha is often depicted as a tree . 
 Since Vishvavasu now did not have a head , but just two arms and a mouth on his stomach , he came to be known as the Rakshasa ( demon ) Kabandha , the " headless torso " . The word Kabandha is often used to describe a large big @-@ bellied barrel or a headless trunk , shaped like a barrel , which retains its vitality . 
 Adhyatma Ramayana tells that Kabandha was a fierce cannibal and his arms were eight miles long . His huge face – which had no eyes or ears – was at his chest . He had no head or legs . 
 = = Encounter with Rama = = 
 The Ramayana narrates : Rama , his consort Sita and his brother Lakshmana were exiled to the forest for a 14 @-@ year period . While in the forest , Sita was kidnapped by the demon @-@ king Ravana . Rama was informed of Sita 's fate by the dying vulture Jatayu , who had been mortally wounded in trying to save her . Searching for Sita , Rama and Lakshmana reached the Krauncha forest , where Kabandha dwelt . The brothers first encountered a demoness , who tempted Lakshmana . Lakshmana cut off her nose , ears , and breasts , and the brothers moved deeper into the forest , where bad omens greeted them . 
 Suddenly , Kabandha appeared before them . The demon blocked the path of the brothers , who tried to escape by taking a different route , but were finally caught by Kabandha . The demon grabbed Rama in his right arm and Lakshmana in his left . Finding themselves helpless in Kabandha 's clutches , Lakshmana appeals to Rama to escape and find Sita , leaving him behind as a sacrifice to the demon . Rama consoled him . Kabandha declared that he was extremely hungry and asked them who they were who had come to sate his hunger . At this time , Lakshmana realized that the strength of the demon lay in his hands and suggested that they cut off the demon 's hands . Annoyed by the brothers ' conversation , Kabandha decided to eat them at once and drew them closer to his mouth . The brothers drew their swords and quickly cut off the arms of the demon , who fell down with a mighty roar . 
 The fallen Kabandha again asked for the names of his <unk> . Lakshmana introduced himself and Rama and asked the demon who he was . Kabandha narrated his story to the brothers and declared that he recognized Rama by the very fact that Rama had severed his arms . Kabandha requested that Rama perform his cremation rites , offered him what information he could , and died . 
 While other adaptations tell a tale about the encounter similar to Ramayana , Mahavira @-@ charita is a notable exception . A woman called Shramana is caught in the clutches of Kabandha and calls for help . While roaming in the Dandaka forest , Rama hears her call and sends Lakshmana to check . Lakshmana kills Kabandha and leads Shramana to Rama . Shramana turns out to be a messenger of Vibhishana ( <unk> ) – brother of Ravana – who has joined forces with Sugriva against Ravana . Anargharaghava mirrors the Mahavira @-@ charita , replacing Shramana with Guha , a forest chief who leads them to Sugriva . 
 = = Counsel to Rama = = 
 The Ramayana narrates : the brothers burnt Kabandha 's corpse on a funeral pyre . As the pyre was lit , Kabandha 's demon form melted and from the flames Vishvavasu rose up in the air in his celestial form , dressed in spotless garments and finery as a chariot from heaven appears to get him . Vishvavasu told the brothers that to fight calamity there are six ways , one of which to nurture a friendship with someone , who is in trouble . He advised the brothers to find the monkey ( vanara ) king Sugriva , who would guide them in the quest for Sita . Vishvavasu informed Rama that Sugriva was driven out of his kingdom by his own brother Vali and that Rama should help Sugriva regain his kingdom . The deposed Sugriva dwelt at Rsyamukha hill . Vishvavasu then described in detail the route to Rsyamukha hill . He instructed Rama to travel in the western direction till he reached the Pampa lake in the region called <unk> where sage Matanga 's hermitage once stood . Ram would meet <unk> at this lake and also sage Matanga 's aged female disciple Shabari , who is waiting for him and after Rama 's visit , would ascend to heaven . To east of <unk> is the Rsyamukha hill , which has an arduous path up . Kabandha revealed that one who ascends to the top of this hill , his dreams come true . Kabandha also assured Rama that his sorrows would end after reaching this hill , where Sugriva dwelt in a cave on the side on the hill . Kabandha then disappears . 
 The Mahabharata corroborates the Ramayana account . Vishvavasu tells Rama to seek the help of Sugriva , who would know where Ravana stays . Kabandha also assured Rama that he would definitely meet Sita again . In the Mahavira @-@ charita , the divine person that leaves the funeral pyre informs Rama that he is Danu and a curse had turned him in a demon , who was manipulated by <unk> – Ravana 's chief adviser – to create havoc in the region . He expresses his gratitude to Rama and cautions him that <unk> has also set Vali against him . 
 In Bhattikavya , Jatayu dies in the arms of Rama without revealing that Sita is in the clutches of Ravana . After his arms are chopped , the unnamed demon – identified with Kabandha – falls and starts his counsel . The funeral pyre scene is dropped here . The demon tells Rama that Ravana abducted Sita and has taken her to Lanka . He advises Rama to form an alliance with Sugriva , without which Ravana will not be overcome . He instructs Rama to negotiate a deal with Sugriva as per which Rama will kill Vali and end Sugriva 's sorrows and in return , Sugriva would mobilize his forces to defeat Ravana . The demon praises Rama , who purified the demon by his sword . The demon urges Rama to believe him as he is telling the truth . At last , the demon transforms into a radiant divine being as he was telling the truth and plunges into the sky . 
 Kamba Ramayana concurs with the Ramayana account about the counsel , but adds a panegyric on Rama by the celestial Danu . Danu exalts Rama as an incarnation of Vishnu and even compares him to baby Krishna , another incarnation of Vishnu . Raghuvamsa , which is a summary of the lives of ancestors of Rama and his own , does not mention the details of the killing of Kabandha , however it acknowledges the counsel . In a passing reference , it notes : " At the advice of Kabandha , who by death escaped from curse , there grew up friendship between Rama and the monkey @-@ chief ( Sugriva ) " . 
 Rama and Lakshmana followed Kabandha 's instructions and reached Pampa Lake . There , as per Kabandha 's prophecy , they met Shabari and then Sugriva . An alliance with Sugriva would finally help Rama defeat Ravana and save Sita . 
 The Adhyatma Ramayana , the Mahavira @-@ charita , the Anargharaghava and the Ramacharitamanas do not discuss the counsel at all and credit Shabari or Shramana or Guha as the one who leads Rama to Sugriva . In the Adhyatma Ramayana , Kabandha appears from the pyre as a divine being and reveals his true identity as a cursed gandharva . He further extols Rama in a hymn stating that various worlds and deities are embedded in parts of his body and Rama is the Supreme being and then disappears .

 On a regular basis , the Ohio Department of Transportation ( ODOT ) conducts surveys to measure the amount of traffic that uses its highway system . These traffic counts are commonly given in terms of average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , a determination of the number of vehicles on a particular segment of roadway on any typical day of the year . A traffic count by ODOT in 2008 showed that 7 @,@ 210 cars and 710 trucks utilized SR 253 on a daily basis . The entirety of SR 253 is included within the National Highway System , a system of routes deemed most important for the economy , mobility and defense of the country .

 The SR 253 designation has been utilized on two separate occasions . The first iteration of the highway began in 1925 . At the time , in the northern half of Medina County , a segment of what is now county @-@ maintained Fenn Road between the SR 18 / SR 57 concurrency and U.S. Route 42 was brought into the state highway system . This roadway , which is located less than 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) north of the city limits of Medina , was given the designation of SR 253 . In 1937 , the route was extended east along Fenn Road to a new eastern terminus at SR 3 northeast of Medina . SR 253 's time of being routed along this stretch of roadway came to an end in 1958 when jurisdiction of Fenn Road was transferred from the state to Medina County . 
 By 1989 , SR 253 was re @-@ introduced to the state highway system . Coinciding with the completion of the Jesse Stuart Memorial Bridge across the Ohio River , the designation was applied to the brief alignment that it maintains to this day from the Kentucky state line on the bridge to the US 52 expressway .

" The segments were written by John Swartzwelder , Steve Tompkins and David S. Cohen respectively . 
 The first version of the episode was very long , so it featured a very short opening sequence and did not include several trademarks established in previous Treehouse of Horror episodes . " Homer3 " , pitched by executive producer Bill Oakley , features three dimensional computer animation provided by Pacific Data Images ( PDI ) . In the final scene of the episode , Homer is sent to the real world in the first ever live @-@ action scene in The Simpsons .

 In a parody of the 1958 film , Attack of the 50 Foot Woman , Homer goes to Lard Lad Donuts to get a " colossal doughnut . " Upon realizing that the colossal doughnut is the name of the doughnut that Lard Lad holds and colossal doughnuts that size do not exist , he denounces the store and vows to get a colossal ( sized ) doughnut . That night , he steals the giant doughnut from the Lard Lad statue in front of the store . In the midst of a freak storm , Lard Lad and other giant advertising statues come to life to terrorize Springfield . Homer eventually returns the donut to Lard Lad , but that does not stop Lard Lad and his friends from causing any more destruction . Lisa goes to the ad agency that created those advertising characters , and an executive suggests the citizens stop paying attention to the monsters as they are advertising gimmicks , and attention is what keeps them motivated . He suggests a jingle will help distract people from watching the monsters . Lisa and Paul Anka later perform a catchy song and the citizens of Springfield stop looking at the monsters , who lose their powers and become lifeless , except for Lard Lad , who manages to tempt Homer into looking into his donut , stating that it now has sprinkles . Homer falls for it , but Bart and Lisa pull him away from it , threatening to poke out Homer 's eyes if he does not comply , much to Homer 's anger . This causes Lard Lad to lose his power and become lifeless .

 In a parody of A Nightmare on Elm Street , Bart has a nightmare that Groundskeeper Willie is out to kill him . He is slashed with a rake , and the scratches are still on his body after he wakes up . Many other students at Springfield Elementary School also confide they were terrorized by Willie in their nightmares . When the students take a test , Martin falls asleep and is strangled to death by Willie in his dream , before waking up and dying in the real world . Bart and Lisa tell Marge , who explains Willie was burned to death ( on Homer 's part of turning up the heat and causing the furnace explosion that killed Willie , the school 's failure to upkeep essential maintenance such as replacing doorknobs and recharging fire extinguishers , and Homer 's misunderstanding ) while the parents of the students looked on and did nothing . Willie told the parents he would get his revenge by killing the children in their dreams , where the parents cannot protect them . Bart , Lisa and Maggie try not to fall asleep for several days , but eventually Bart decides that he is going to have to go to sleep and fight Willie in his dream . Lisa is supposed to stay awake and wake him up if he seems to be in trouble . Bart falls asleep and attempts to find Willie , who appears as a lawn mower / harvester . Bart , taunting Willie by calling him " Yard Boy " ( a parody of the lawn tractor company ) , manages to trick Willie into mowing over a sandbox containing quicksand , and Willie sinks . Willie recovers and turns into a giant bagpipe spider and is about to kill Bart when Lisa enters , trying to wake him up . Bart realizes that since she is in the dream , that means she has also fallen asleep . At that point , Willie grabs Lisa , intending to kill her too . They are about to lose the battle when Maggie appears and uses her pacifier to seal the vent on Willie 's spider body , resulting in Willie exploding . When they wake up , they find Willie is still alive and unsuccessfully attempts to both scare them and kill them .

 In a parody of the Twilight Zone episode , Little Girl Lost , Patty and Selma visit the Simpsons with two pillow cases full of seashells from their trip to " Sulphur Bay " from which they plan to pry hermit crabs . Homer tries to hide in a closet that Bart and Lisa have occupied , but they refuse to leave . After failing to find another hiding spot , Homer , desperate to avoid Patty and Selma , looks behind a bookcase and enters a mysterious new world in which everything is in 3D . Homer explores the peculiar area , being depicted as a 3D computer @-@ generated character . Bart and Lisa are found by Selma and are forced into the hermit crab work . 
 Through the wall , Homer calls Marge for help . Marge summons Ned Flanders , Reverend Lovejoy , Professor Frink , Chief Wiggum , and Dr. Hibbert to help Homer escape this alternate dimension , but they are of no help . Homer explains that the world he is in looks like something from Tron , but no one understands the reference to that computer @-@ generated film . Frink explains to the others that Homer is in a hypothetical " third dimension " . 
 Homer throws a cone into the floor and accidentally pierces the fabric of the space @-@ time continuum , causing it to collapse into a wormhole and threatening to pull Homer and the rest of the dimension into a black hole . Bart takes command and enters the third dimension to save Homer , after tying a safety rope around himself . Once there , Bart tells Homer to leap over the increasingly massive wormhole . Homer , declaring this to be a " piece of cake " , leaps and falls into the hole as the universe collapses on itself . Bart , however , is pulled back into the house . Lovejoy assures Marge that Homer has gone to a better place . Meanwhile , Homer lands in a dumpster in a live @-@ action West Hollywood . He is initially nervous and scared of his surroundings including the astonished passersby , but his troubles are soon put aside when he comes across an erotic cake shop and he goes inside . 
 Homer3 later became a segment in IMAX 's CyberWorld 3D . 
 = = Production = = 
 " Treehouse of Horror VI " was the first of two Treehouse of Horror episodes to be executive produced by Bill Oakley and Josh Weinstein . The episode was " so long " because , according to Oakley , " all three of these segments are very complex stories [ ... ] and it 's hard to fit three complete stories into 21 minutes . " Because of the length , the episode featured a very short opening sequence and did not include several trademarks established in previous Treehouse of Horror episodes , such as Marge 's warning or wraparounds . The first segment , " Attack of the 50 @-@ Foot Eyesores " was written by John Swartzwelder , who had previously worked at an advertising agency . " Nightmare on Evergreen Terrace " was written by Steve Tompkins and has been described by David X. Cohen as " one of the scariest [ segments ] . " " Homer3 " was written by Cohen , although the idea was pitched by Oakley . The original idea was that Homer would visit several dimensions , including one where everything was made of paper cut @-@ outs , but they decided that it would be too complicated . 
 The episode includes a cameo appearance from Paul Anka , who sings the song " Just Don 't Look " . Anka was briefly mentioned by Marge in " Grampa vs. Sexual Inadequacy . " In response , he sent a letter to the producers in which he thanked them for the mention . After receiving the letter , they decided to ask him to guest star . According to David Mirkin , he tried to get Al Gore to host the episode , but the producers got no response to their request . " There was an eerie silence , " Mirkin said . He added that " if the VP decides now to pursue this showbiz offer , it 's just too late [ ... ] He missed his chance . " 
 In the final scene of the episode , Homer is sent to the real world in the first ever live @-@ action scene in The Simpsons . It was filmed on Ventura Boulevard in Studio City and directed by David Mirkin , who later said that Fox " couldn 't have been less supportive " because they thought it would be too expensive . The scene involves a crane shot which pulls back as the credits are shown . Fox " begrudgingly " allowed Mirkin to use a crane for the ending . The scene was filmed on a sidewalk with the crane on the street and Mirkin was not able to fully stop traffic for the shot . Because of this , when the camera swings around , a line of cars can be seen backed up on the street . The erotic cakes store as well as the filming was located in 13567 Ventura Boulevard . 
 = = = Animation = = = 
 A large portion of " Homer3 " was three dimensional and computer animated . Supervising director David Silverman was aiming for something better than the computer animation used in the music video for " Money for Nothing " by Dire Straits . The animation was provided by Pacific Data Images ( PDI ) and overseen by Tim Johnson . The animators at PDI worked closely with the normal animators on The Simpsons and worked hard not to " reinvent the character [ s ] " . The Simpsons animators storyboarded the segments and showed the PDI animators how they would have handled the scenes . While designing the 3D model of Bart , the animators did not know how they would show Bart 's hair . However , they realized that there were vinyl Bart dolls in production and purchased one to use as a model . One of the most difficult parts for the PDI animators was to make Homer and Bart move properly without making them look robotic . 
 One of the key shots in the segment was where Homer steps into the 3D world and his design transitions into 3D . Executive producer Bill Oakley considers the shot the " money shot " and had a difficult time communicating his idea to the animators . 
 = = = Background jokes = = = 
 Several background jokes were inserted into " Homer3 " . The PDI animators inserted a Utah teapot , which was the first object to be rendered in 3D , and the numbers 734 ( which on a phone pad correspond to PDI ) . Several math equations were also inserted in the background , one of the equations that appears is 178212 + 184112 = 192212 . Although a false statement , it appears to be true when evaluated on a typical calculator with 10 digits of precision . If it were true , it would disprove Fermat 's last theorem , which had just been proven when this episode first aired . Cohen generated this " Fermat near @-@ miss " with a computer program . Other equations that appear are Euler 's identity and P = NP which is a reference to the famous P vs NP problem , and similarly contradicts the general belief that in fact P ≠ NP . The code 46 72 69 6E 6B 20 72 75 6C 65 73 21 is a string of hexadecimal numbers that , when interpreted as ASCII codes , decodes to " Frink rules ! " . There is a signpost with x , y and z , and many basic shapes littered across the screen . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The title of " Attack of the 50 @-@ Foot Eyesores " is a reference to the film Attack of the 50 Foot Woman . " Nightmare on Evergreen Terrace " is a parody of the film A Nightmare on Elm Street and its sequels , and Bart 's dream at the opening of the segment features many elements similar to the cartoons of Tex Avery . Willie changing shapes while sinking in the sand box is similar to the T @-@ 1000 's " death " in Terminator 2 : Judgment Day and Martin 's dream references The <unk> , while Willie being a shapeshifting monster whose final form is that of a giant spider is similar to Pennywise the Dancing Clown , the main antagonist of It . The segment " Homer3 " is a parody of The Twilight Zone episode " Little Girl Lost " , in which a girl travels through a portal to the 4th dimension . He even describes the series as " that <unk> show about that zone . " The film Tron is also mentioned by Homer as a means of describing his surroundings ( it is claimed that nobody in Springfield saw the film ) . The segment where Bart ties a rope around himself and enters the 3D world in an attempt to rescue Homer is a reference to the film Poltergeist . The building Homer encounters inside the third dimension is a recreation of the library from the PC game Myst accompanied with the library 's theme music briefly playing in the background . The three @-@ dimensional rotation shot of the dimensional vortex is a reference to the green glowing grid in the opening credits of the Disney film The Black Hole . In " Homer3 " , as he is about to fall in the black hole Homer says , " There 's so much I don 't know about astrophysics . I wish I 'd read that book by that wheelchair guy . " This is a reference to the bestseller A Brief History of Time by astrophysicist Stephen Hawking , who is <unk> . In " Attack of the 50 Foot Eyesores " , some of the mascots are parodies of real life mascots . For example , the giant walking unnamed peanut is a parody of Mr. Peanut . When the donut rolls by them on the highway Kang and Kodos use the word <unk> from the television series Mork & Mindy .

 The authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , described it as " Complex , very assured and very clever , [ ... ] The computer graphics are outstanding , and the final scene – as Homer enters our dimension – is one of the highlights of the entire series . " Colin Jacobson of DVD Movie Guide said , " ' Attack of the 50 @-@ Ft . Eyesores ' stands as the strongest of the three segments . It doesn ’ t blast off the screen but it seems imaginative and fun . The Nightmare on Elm Street parody has its moments and comes across as generally entertaining . However , it lacks the bite the best pieces offer . Unfortunately , ' Homer3 ' gives us the weakest of the bunch .

 Sweet Sweetback 's Baadasssss Song is a 1971 American independent drama film , written , produced , scored , directed by , and starring Melvin Van Peebles , father of actor Mario Van Peebles ( who is also in the movie ) . It tells the picaresque story of a poor African American man on his flight from the white authority . Van Peebles began to develop the film after being offered a three @-@ picture contract for Columbia Pictures . No studio would finance the film , so Van Peebles funded the film himself , shooting it independently over a period of 19 days , performing all of his own stunts and appearing in several unsimulated sex scenes . He received a $ 50 @,@ 000 loan from Bill Cosby to complete the project . The film 's fast @-@ paced montages and jump @-@ cuts were unique features in American cinema at the time . The picture was censored in some markets , and received mixed critical reviews . However , it has left a lasting impression on African @-@ American cinema . 
 The musical score of Sweet Sweetback 's Baadasssss Song was performed by Earth , Wind & Fire . Van Peebles did not have any money for traditional advertising methods , so he released the soundtrack album prior to the film 's release in order to generate publicity . Initially , the film was screened only in two theaters in the United States . It went on to gross $ 4 @.@ 1 million at the box office . Huey P. Newton celebrated and welcomed the film 's revolutionary implications , and Sweetback became required viewing for members of the Black Panther Party . According to Variety , it demonstrated to Hollywood that films which portrayed " militant " blacks could be highly profitable , leading to the creation of the blaxploitation genre , although some do not consider this example of Van Peebles ' work to be an exploitation film . 
 = = Plot = = 
 A young African American orphan ( Mario Van Peebles ) is taken in by the proprietor of a Los Angeles brothel in the 1940s . While working there as a towel boy , he loses his virginity at a young age to one of the prostitutes . The women name him " Sweet Sweetback " in honor of his sexual prowess and large penis . As an adult , Sweetback ( Melvin Van Peebles ) works as a performer in the whorehouse , entertaining customers by performing in a sex show . One night , a pair of LAPD officers come in to speak to Sweetback 's boss , Beetle ( Simon <unk> ) . A black man had been murdered , and there is pressure from the black community to bring in a suspect . The police ask permission to arrest Sweetback , blame him for the crime , and then release him a few days later for lack of evidence , in order to appease the black community . Beetle agrees , and the officers arrest Sweetback . On the way to the police station , the officers arrest a young Black Panther named Mu @-@ Mu ( Hubert Scales ) . They handcuff him to Sweetback , but when Mu @-@ Mu insults the officers , they take both men out of the car , undo the handcuff from Mu @-@ Mu 's wrist , and beat him . In response , Sweetback uses the handcuffs , still hanging from his wrist , to beat the officers into unconsciousness . 
 The remainder of the film chronicles Sweetback 's flight through South Central Los Angeles towards the United States – Mexico border . Sweetback is captured by the police and violently interrogated about his previous assault on the arresting officers , but he escapes when a riot breaks out . Sweetback goes to a woman who cuts his handcuffs off in exchange for sex . With his handcuffs off , Sweetback continues onward , only to be captured by a chapter of the Hells Angels . The female leader of the gang is impressed by the size of Sweetback 's penis , and agrees to help him and Mu @-@ Mu escape from the police in exchange for sex . The police find Sweetback and Mu @-@ Mu at the bikers ' hangout , but Sweetback escapes on foot while Mu @-@ Mu goes away with the bikers . Mu @-@ Mu and one of the bikers ( John Amos ) are killed . After his escape from the bikers ' hangout , a white man sympathetic to Sweetback 's cause agrees to switch clothes with him , allowing the usually velour @-@ clad Sweetback to blend in . The police find Sweetback 's former foster mother , who reveals that Sweetback 's birth name is Leroy . The film concludes in the desert , where the L.A. police send several hunting dogs after Sweetback . He makes it into the Tijuana River , and escapes into Mexico , swearing to return to " collect dues " .

 After Melvin Van Peebles had completed Watermelon Man for Columbia Pictures , he was offered a three @-@ picture contract . While the deal was still up in the air , Van Peebles developed the story for Sweet Sweetback 's Baadasssss Song . The initial idea for the film did not come clearly to him at first . One day , Van Peebles drove into the Mojave desert , turned off the highway , and drove over the rise of a hill . He parked the car , got out , and squatted down facing the sun . He decided that the film was going to be " about a brother getting the Man 's foot out of his ass . " Because no studio would finance the film , Van Peebles put his own money into the production , and shot it independently . Van Peebles was given a $ 50 @,@ 000 loan by Bill Cosby to complete the film . " Cosby didn 't want an equity part , " according to Van Peebles . " He just wanted his money back . " Van Peebles wound up with controlling ownership of the film . Several actors auditioned for the lead role of Sweetback , but told Van Peebles that they wouldn 't do the film unless they were given more dialogue . Van Peebles ended up playing the part himself . 
 According to Van Peebles , during the first day of shooting , director of photography and head cameraman Bob Maxwell told him he could not mix two different shades of mechanical film lights , because he believed the results would not appear well on film . Van Peebles told him to do it anyway . When he saw the rushes , Maxwell was overjoyed , and Van Peebles did not encounter that issue again during the shoot . Van Peebles shot the film over a period of 19 days in order to avoid the possibility of the cast , most of whom were amateurs , showing on some days with haircuts or clothes different from the prior day . He shot the film in what he referred to as " globs , " where he would shoot entire sequences at a time . Because Van Peebles couldn 't afford a stunt man , he performed all of the stunts himself , which also included appearing in several unsimulated sex scenes . At one point in the shoot , Van Peebles was forced to jump off a bridge . Bob Maxwell later stated , " Well , that 's great , Mel , but let 's do it again . " Van Peebles ended up performing the stunt nine times . Van Peebles contracted gonorrhea when filming one of the many sex scenes , and successfully applied to the Directors Guild in order to get workers ' compensation because he was " hurt on the job . " Van Peebles used the money to purchase more film . 
 Van Peebles and several key crew members were armed because it was dangerous to attempt to create a film without the support of the union . One day , Van Peebles looked for his gun , and failed to find it . Van Peebles found out that someone had put it in the prop box . When they filmed the scene in which Beetle is interrogated by police , who fire a gun next to both of his ears , it was feared that the real gun would be picked up instead of the prop . While shooting a sequence with members of the Hells Angels , one of the bikers told Van Peebles they wanted to leave ; Van Peebles responded by telling them they were paid to shoot until the scene was over . The biker took out a knife and started cleaning his fingernails with it . In response , Van Peebles snapped his fingers , and his crewmembers were standing there with rifles . The bikers stayed to shoot the scene . 
 Van Peebles had received a permit to set a car on fire , but had done so on a Friday ; as a result , there was no time to have it filed before shooting the scene . When the scene was shot , a fire truck showed up . This ended up in the final cut of the film . 
 = = = Directing = = = 
 Van Peebles stated that he approached directing the film " like you do the cupboard when you 're broke and hungry : throw in everything <unk> and hope to come out on top with the seasoning , i.e. , by editing . " Van Peebles stated that " story @-@ wise , I came up with an idea , why not the direct approach . [ ... ] To avoid putting myself into a corner and writing something I wouldn 't be able to shoot , I made a list of the givens in the situation and tried to take those givens and juggle them into the final scenario . " 
 Van Peebles wanted " a victorious film [ ... ] where niggers could walk out standing tall instead of avoiding each other 's eyes , looking once again like they 'd had it . " Van Peebles was aware of the fact that films produced by major studios would appear to be more polished than low @-@ budget independently made features , and was determined to make a film that " [ looked ] as good as anything one of the major studios could turn out . " 
 Van Peebles knew that in order to spread his message , the film " simply couldn 't be a didactic discourse which would end up playing [ ... ] to an empty theater except for ten or twenty aware brothers who would pat me on the back and say it tells it like it is " and that " to attract the mass we have to produce work that not only instructs but entertains " . Van Peebles also wanted to make a film that would " be able to sustain itself as a viable commercial product [ ... ] [ The Man ] ain 't about to go carrying no messages for you , especially a relevant one , for free . " 
 Van Peebles wanted half of his shooting crew " to be third world people . [ ... ] So at best a staggering amount of my crew would be relatively inexperienced . [ ... ] Any type of film requiring an enormous technical sophistication at the shooting stage should not be attempted . " Van Peebles knew that gaining financing for the film would not be easy and expected " a great deal of animosity from the film media ( white in the first place and right wing in the second ) at all levels of filmmaking " , thus he had to " write a flexible script where emphasis could be shifted . In short , stay loose . " 
 = = = Editing = = = 
 The film 's fast @-@ paced montages and jump @-@ cuts were novel features for an American movie at the time . Stephen Holden from The New York Times commented that the film 's editing had " a jazzy , improvisational quality , and the screen is often streaked with jarring psychedelic effects that illustrate Sweetback 's alienation . " In The 50 Most Influential Black Films : A Celebration of African @-@ American Talent , Determination , and Creativity , author S. <unk> Berry writes that the film 's " odd camera angles , superimpositions , reverse @-@ key effects , box and matting effects , rack @-@ focus shots , extreme zooms , stop @-@ motion and step @-@ printing , and an abundance of jittery handheld camera work all helped to express the paranoid nightmare that [ Sweetback 's ] life had become . " 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Since Van Peebles did not have the money to hire a composer , he composed the film 's music score himself . Because he did not know how to read or write music , he numbered all of the keys on a piano so he could remember the melodies . Van Peebles stated that " Most filmmakers look at a feature in terms of image and story or vice versa . Effects and music [ ... ] are strictly secondary considerations . Very few look at film with sound considered as a creative third dimension . So I calculate the scenario in such a way that sound can be used as an integral part of the film . " 
 The film 's music was performed by the then @-@ unknown group Earth , Wind & Fire , who were living in a single apartment with hardly any food at the time . Van Peebles ' secretary was dating one of the bandmembers , and convinced him to contact them about performing the music for the film . Van Peebles projected scenes from the film as the band performed the music . By alternating hymn @-@ based vocalization and jazz rhythms , Van Peebles created a sound that foreshadowed the use of sampling in hip hop music . 
 Van Peebles recalls that " music was not used as a selling tool in movies at the time . Even musicals , it would take three months after the release of the movie before they would bring out an album . " Because Van Peebles did not have any money for traditional advertising methods , he decided that by releasing a soundtrack album in anticipation of the film 's release , he could help build awareness for the film with its music . 
 = = Release and alterations = = 
 The film was released on April 23 , 1971 . Melvin Van Peebles stated that " at first , only two theaters in the United States would show the picture : one in Detroit , and one in Atlanta . The first night in Detroit , it broke all the theater 's records , and that was only on the strength of the title alone , since nobody had seen it yet . By the second day , people would take their lunch and sit through it three times . I knew that I was finally talking to my audience . Sweet Sweetback 's Baadasssss Song made thousands of dollars in its first day . " The film grossed $ 15 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 + at the box office . 
 After Sweetback received an X rating from the Motion Picture Association of America , inspiring the advertising tagline " Rated X by an all @-@ white jury " , and a theater in Boston cut nine minutes out of the film , Van Peebles stated , " Should the rest of the community submit to your censorship that is its business , but White standards shall no longer be imposed on the Black community . " The Region 2 DVD release from BFI Video has the opening sex sequences altered . A notice at the beginning of the DVD states " In order to comply with UK law ( the Protection of Children Act 1978 ) , a number of images in the opening sequence of this film have been obscured . "

 The end of the film was shocking to black viewers who had expected that Sweetback would perish at the hands of the police — a common , even inevitable , fate of black men " on the run " in prior films . Film critic Roger Ebert cited the ending as a reason for the film not to be labeled as an exploitation film . Critical response was mixed . Kevin Thomas in the Los Angeles Times described the film as " a series of stark , earthy vignettes , Van Peebles evokes the vitality , humor , pain , despair and omnipresent fear that is life for so many African @-@ Americans " . Stephen Holden in The New York Times called it " an innovative , yet politically inflammatory film . " The film website Rotten Tomatoes , which compiles reviews from a wide range of critics , gives the film a score of 73 % " Fresh " . 
 Huey P. Newton , devoting an entire issue of The Black Panther to the film 's revolutionary implications , celebrated and welcomed the film as " the first truly revolutionary Black film made [ ... ] presented to us by a Black man . " Newton wrote that Sweetback " presents the need for unity among all members and institutions within the community of victims , " contending that this is evidenced by the opening credits which state the film stars " The Black Community , " a collective protagonist engaged in various acts of community solidarity that aid Sweetback in escaping . Newton further argued that " the film demonstrates the importance of unity and love between Black men and women , " as demonstrated " in the scene where the woman makes love to the young boy but in fact baptizes him into his true manhood . " The film became required viewing for members of Black Panther Party . 
 A few months after the publication of Newton 's article , <unk> Bennett responded with an essay on the film in Ebony , titled " The Emancipation Orgasm : Sweetback in Wonderland , " in which he discussed the film 's " black aesthetic " . Bennett argued that the film romanticized the poverty and misery of the ghetto and that " some men foolishly identify the black aesthetic with empty bellies and big bottomed prostitutes . " Bennett concluded that the film is " neither revolutionary nor black because it presents the spectator with sterile daydreams and a superhero who is ahistorical , selfishly individualist with no revolutionary program , who acts out of panic and desperation . " Bennett described Sweetback 's sexual initiation at ten years old as the " rape of a child by a 40 @-@ year @-@ old prostitute . " Bennett described instances when Sweetback saved himself through the use of his sexual prowess as " emancipation orgasms " and stated that " it is necessary to say frankly that nobody ever fucked his way to freedom . And it is mischievous and reactionary finally for anyone to suggest to black people in 1971 that they are going to be able to screw their way across the Red Sea . Fucking will not set you free . If fucking freed , black people would have celebrated the millennium 400 years ago . " 
 Black nationalist poet and author Haki R. <unk> ( Don L. Lee ) agreed with Bennett 's assessment of the film , stating that it was " a limited , money @-@ making , auto @-@ biographical fantasy of the odyssey of one Melvin Van Peebles through what he considered to be the Black community . " The New York Times critic Clayton Riley viewed the film more favorably , commenting on its aesthetic innovation , but stated of the character of Sweetback that he " is the ultimate <unk> in whose seemingly vacant eyes and unrevealing mouth are written the protocols of American domestic colonialism . " In another review , Riley explained that " Sweetback , the profane sexual athlete and fugitive , is based on a reality that is Black . We may not want him to exist but he does . " Critic Donald Bogle states in a New York Times interview that the film in some ways met the black audience 's compensatory needs after years of asexual , Sidney Poitier @-@ type characters and that they wanted a " viable , sexual , assertive , arrogant black male hero . "

 Sweet Sweetback 's Baadasssss Song is considered to be an important film in the history of African American cinema . Hollywood studios were led to attempt to replicate the film 's success by producing black @-@ oriented films such as Shaft and Super Fly . Sweet Sweetback 's Baadasssss Song was credited by Variety as leading to the creation of the blaxploitation genre , largely consisting of exploitation films made by white directors . As Spike Lee states , " Sweet Sweetback 's Baadasssss Song gave us all the answers we needed . This was an example of how to make a film ( a real movie ) , distribute it yourself , and most important , get paid . Without Sweetback who knows if there could have been a [ ... ] She 's Gotta Have It , Hollywood Shuffle , or House Party ? " In 2004 , Mario Van Peebles directed and starred as his father in Baadasssss ! , a biopic about the making of Sweet Sweetback . The film was a critical but not commercial success . 
 = Hurricane Bob ( 1979 ) = 
 Hurricane Bob was the first Atlantic tropical cyclone to be officially designated using a masculine name after the discontinuation of Joint Army / Navy Phonetic Alphabet names . Bob brought moderate damage to portions of the United States Gulf Coast and areas farther inland in July 1979 . The storm was the first hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico to form in the month of July since 1959 , and was the fifth tropical cyclone to form during the annual hurricane season . Though the origin of Bob can be traced back to a tropical wave near the western coast of Africa in late June , Bob formed from a tropical depression in the southwestern Gulf of Mexico on July 9 . Tracking in a general northward direction , favorable conditions allowed for quick strengthening . Less than a day after formation , the system reached tropical storm intensity , followed by hurricane intensity on July 11 . Shortly after strengthening into a hurricane , Bob reached its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 75 mph ( 121 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 986 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 12 inHg ) . At the same intensity , Bob made landfall west of Grand Isle , Louisiana , and rapidly weakened after moving inland . However , the resulting tropical depression persisted for several days as it paralleled the Mississippi and Ohio rivers . On July 16 , the system emerged into the western Atlantic , where it was subsequently absorbed by a nearby low @-@ pressure area . 
 Widespread offshore and coastal evacuations took place along the United States Gulf Coast in preparation for Hurricane Bob . Effects from the hurricane on the United States were mostly marginal and typical of a minimal hurricane . The cyclone produced a moderate storm surge , damaging some coastal installments and causing coastal inundation . Strong winds were also associated with Bob 's landfall , though no stations observed winds of hurricane force . The winds downed trees and blew out windows , in addition to causing widespread power outages . Heavy rainfall was also reported in some locations , peaking at 7 @.@ 16 in ( 182 mm ) in Louisiana . Further inland , the torrential rains led to flooding in Indiana , resulting in more considerable damage as opposed to the coast . Bob also spawned eight tornadoes , with two causing significant damage . Overall , Bob was responsible for one death and $ 20 million in damage . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origin of Hurricane Bob can be traced to a tropical wave that was first located near Cape Verde towards the end of June . The disturbance tracked westward with minimal signs of development , and reached the northwestern Caribbean Sea on July 6 . The following day , the tropical system tracked across the Yucatán Peninsula the following day , and upon emerging into the Gulf of Mexico , the cluster of storms began to develop a weak circulation center . This enabled for more rapid tropical cyclogenesis , and at 1200 UTC on July 9 , the disturbance was analyzed to have organized into a tropical depression – the third of such in the Atlantic that year . The depression strengthened rather quickly , and on the morning of July 10 a United States Air Force reconnaissance flight indicated that the tropical cyclone had strengthened to tropical storm intensity while situated 740 mi ( 1 @,@ 190 km ) south of Louisiana . Due to the storm 's intensity , the system was consequentially named Bob , making it the first Atlantic tropical cyclone to receive a masculine name since 1952 . At the time the flight measured a minimum barometric pressure of 998 mbar ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 47 inHg ) . 
 Upon reaching tropical storm intensity , Bob began to curve further northward as opposed to its prior , northeasterly track , due to the presence of a strengthening , upper @-@ level trough to the storm 's west . The trough greatly enhanced atmospheric conditions around Bob , allowing for the tropical cyclone to intensify rapidly . At 0000 UTC on July 11 , Bob was estimated to have strengthened to hurricane intensity based on additional reconnaissance flight data . This made Bob the first July hurricane in the Gulf of Mexico since Hurricane Debra in 1959 . Though the hurricane 's maximum sustained winds would hold steady at 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) for approximately the ensuing twelve hours , the storm 's barometric pressure would fluctuate before reaching a minimum of 981 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 98 inHg ) at 1200 UTC that day ; this would be Bob 's lowest documented barometric pressure . At around the same time , the hurricane made landfall west of Grand Isle , Louisiana . After moving inland , Bob quickly weakened due to land interaction , and was a mere tropical depression by July 12 . However , the resulting depression would maintain its intensity for the next several days . On July 13 , the low @-@ pressure area drifted into southern Ohio and afterwards curved eastward . On July 16 , Bob 's remnants moved into the western Atlantic , where they were subsequently absorbed by another low @-@ pressure area . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 As Bob moved towards the U.S. Gulf Coast , the National Weather Service issued gale warnings for coastal regions extending from Vermilion Bay , Louisiana to Biloxi , Mississippi at 1600 UTC on July 10 . These warnings were upgraded to hurricane warnings upon Bob 's strengthening to such an intensity . During the storm 's existence , forecasts and predictions from the National Hurricane Center were of greater accuracy than on average . In addition to tropical cyclone warnings and watches , the agency also advised small craft from Port Arthur , Texas to Pensacola , Florida to remain in port . 
 In preparation for the storm , 8 @,@ 000 offshore oil workers were evacuated . Despite typical evacuation procedure , Chevron Corporation immediately evacuated their offshore oil staff rather than executing a three phase evacuation plan . On land , 2 @,@ 500 residents and tourists on Grand Isle were also evacuated . In total , as many as 80 @,@ 000 people evacuated from coastal areas leading up to Bob 's eventual landfall . In New Orleans , 4 @,@ 000 people checked in to the city 's 19 evacuation centers . The Mississippi River was temporarily closed to shipping by the United States Coast Guard for eight hours before reopening after the storm . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Effects in the United States as a result of Bob were typical of a minimal hurricane , and were not of considerable nature . At the coast , Bob caused moderate storm surge , resulting in coastal waters rising to as high as 5 ft ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) above normal . The rough seas sunk several boats and caused significant damage to piers . A levee on Grand Isle was breached by the surge , resulting in some coastal inundation . Minor beach erosion occurred on the coast of Mississippi . In Mobile County , Alabama , the wave action damaged cars near the shore and disrupted seafood operations in the Bayou La Batre area . 
 Strong winds were reported in association with the storm , but no station documented sustained winds within hurricane force . The highest wind observation was taken on an oil rig off the coast of Louisiana , which clocked sustained winds at 63 mph ( 101 km / h ) . However , the strongest wind gust in association with the hurricane was measured in Bay St. Louis , Mississippi , at 64 mph ( 103 km / h ) . In New Orleans , these strong winds damaged trees and power lines , and also broke several windows in the city 's central business district . In addition , widespread power outages impacted 53 @,@ 000 electricity customers in the city 's area . Similar incidents took place in Houma , Louisiana . In Lafitte , Louisiana , two men were blown off of the roof of a marina , and one of them was killed ; this would be the only death associated with the hurricane . Further east , in Florida , trees and power lines were downed in <unk> . 
 Hurricane Bob also produced a widespread area of rain that was heavy in localized areas . Rainfall associated with the hurricane peaked at 7 @.@ 16 in ( 182 mm ) in Louisiana , where the storm made landfall . Statewide rainfall totals peaked at 6 @.@ 64 and 4 @.@ 81 in ( 169 and 122 mm ) in Pascagoula , Mississippi and Robertsdale , Alabama , respectively . Further inland , the remnants of Bob dropped heavy rainfall in the Midwestern United States , peaking at 5 @.@ 72 in ( 145 mm ) at a station in Indiana University Bloomington . In addition to the strong winds and heavy rain , Bob produced eight tornadoes across the southern United States . One of these tornadoes caused $ 27 @,@ 500 in damage after striking areas of Biloxi , Mississippi . Another tornado impacted areas near Red Level , Alabama destroying or damaging several buildings and uprooting trees . Overall , Hurricane Bob caused approximately $ 20 million in damage . However , $ 15 million in damage resulted from flooding in Indiana , with the rest of the storm 's monetary impacts arising from coastal regions . 
 = Wulfhelm = 
 Wulfhelm ( died 941 ) was Bishop of Wells before being promoted to the Archbishopric of Canterbury about 926 . Nothing is known about his time at Wells , but as archbishop he helped codify royal law codes and gave lands to monasteries . He went to Rome soon after his selection as archbishop . Two religious books that he gave to his cathedral are still extant . 
 = = Biography = = 
 Wulfhelm was elected and consecrated Bishop of Wells between 923 and September 925 . Nothing else is known about his time at Wells . 
 Wulfhelm was translated from the Bishopric of Wells to be Archbishop of Canterbury in about 926 . While he was archbishop , he was a frequent attendee of the royal court , and King Æthelstan of England says in his law code that Wulfhelm was consulted on the drafting of the laws . Wulfhelm also advised the king on the Ordinance on Charities issued by Æthelstan . One of the surviving manuscripts of Æthelstan 's laws has an epilogue that stated that the law was declared and decided at a synod held at Grately where Wulfhelm was present . From other parts of the laws issued by the king , it appears that Wulfhelm also presided at a council held at Thunderfield , at which the reeves of London pledged to keep the king 's peace . The implication of the various accounts of the laws of Æthelstan is that Wulfhelm was highly involved in royal efforts to improve the law code . 
 Wulfhelm also went to Rome to receive his pallium in person from Pope John X. Why he chose to go to Rome in person for his pallium rather than having it sent to him like most of his predecessors is unknown . One suggestion has been that because he had been translated from another see , Wulfhelm felt the need to have papal approval of his translation made explicit . Given the low status of the papacy at the time , it is unlikely that the impetus for the change in tradition came from the pope . 
 Wulfhelm died while archbishop on 12 February 941 . During his time as archbishop , he received as gifts two gospels that are still extant , as Wulfhelm donated them to Christ Church . One of the gospels was produced in Ireland , the other either in Lotharingia or Germany . The second gospel may originally have been a gift to Æthelstan during the negotiations over the marriage of Æthelstan 's sister Edith to the future Emperor Otto I. These diplomatic events probably explain the appearance of Wulfhelm 's name in the confraternity books of some German monasteries . He may also have given land to the church , although the record is a bit unclear as to exactly what was given . Another grant of land was of land at <unk> , Wiltshire to Glastonbury Abbey while he was archbishop . 
 Wulfhelm was buried at Canterbury . He was buried at first the church of St John the Baptist near the Saxon @-@ era Canterbury Cathedral . When a new cathedral was constructed under Archbishop Lanfranc after the Norman Conquest of England , the earlier archbishops of Canterbury were moved to the north transept of the new cathedral . Later , Wulfhelm and his predecessor as bishop and archbishop Athelm were moved to a chapel dedicated to St Benedict , which later was incorporated into the Lady Chapel constructed by Prior Thomas Goldstone ( d . 1468 ) .

 Super Smash Bros. , originally released in Japan as Nintendo All Star ! Dairantō Smash Brothers ( Japanese : <unk> ！ <unk> ( <unk> ) <unk> , Hepburn : Nintendō <unk> Sutā ! Dairantō <unk> Burazāzu , lit . " Nintendo All Star ! Great Melee Smash Brothers " ) , is a fighting game developed by HAL Laboratory and published by Nintendo for the Nintendo 64 home video game console . It was released in Japan on January 21 , 1999 ; in North America on April 26 , 1999 ; and in Europe on November 19 , 1999 . Super Smash Bros. is the first game in the Super Smash Bros. series ; its successor , Super Smash Bros. Melee , was released for the GameCube in 2001 . 
 The game is a crossover between many different Nintendo franchises , including Mario , Donkey Kong , The Legend of Zelda , Metroid , Mother , F @-@ Zero , Yoshi , Kirby , Star Fox and Pokémon . It received mostly positive reviews from the media and was commercially successful , selling over 5 million copies worldwide by 2001 , with 2 @.@ 93 million sold in the United States and 1 @.@ 97 million copies sold in Japan . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The Super Smash Bros. series is a departure from many fighting games ; instead of winning by depleting an opponent 's life bar , Smash Bros. players seek to knock opposing characters off a stage . Each player has a damage total , represented by a percentage , which rises as damage is taken and can exceed 100 % , with a maximum damage of 999 % . As this percentage rises , the character can be knocked progressively farther by an opponent 's attacks . To KO an opponent , the player must send that character flying off the edge of the stage , which is not an enclosed arena but rather an area with open boundaries , many suspended in an otherwise empty space . When knocked off the stage , a character may use jumping moves in an attempt to return ; some characters have longer @-@ ranged jumps and may have an easier time " recovering " than others . Additionally , characters have different weights , making it harder for heavier opponents to be knocked off the edge , but reciprocally harder for them to recover once sent flying . 
 While games such as Street Fighter and Tekken require players to memorize relatively lengthy and complicated button @-@ input combinations often specific to only a particular character , Super Smash Bros. uses the same control combinations to access all moves for all characters . Characters are additionally not limited to only facing opponents , instead being allowed to run around freely on the stage . The game focuses more on aerial and platforming skills than other fighting games , with relatively larger , more @-@ dynamic stages rather than a simple flat platform . Smash Bros. also implements blocking and dodging mechanics . Grabbing and throwing other characters is also possible . 
 Various weapons and power @-@ ups can be used in battle to inflict damage , recover health , or dispense additional items . They fall randomly onto the stage in the form of items from Nintendo franchises , such as Koopa shells , hammers , and Poké Balls . The nine multiplayer stages are locations taken from or in the style of Nintendo franchises , such as Planet Zebes from Metroid and Sector Z from Star Fox . Although stages are rendered in three dimensions , players can only move within a two @-@ dimensional plane . Stages are dynamic , ranging from simple moving platforms to dramatic alterations of the entire stage . Each stage offers unique gameplay and strategic motives , making the chosen stage an additional factor in the fight . 
 In the game 's single @-@ player mode , the player chooses a character with which to battle a series of computer @-@ controlled opponents in a specific order , attempting to defeat them with a limited number of lives in a limited amount of time per challenger . While the player can determine the difficulty level and number of lives , the same series of opponents are always fought . If the player loses all of their lives or runs out of time , they have the option to continue at the cost of a considerable sum of their overall points . This mode is referred to as Classic Mode in sequels . The single @-@ player mode also include two minigames , " Break the Targets " and " Board the Platforms " , in which the objective is to break each target or board multiple special platforms , respectively . The goal must be achieved without falling off each character @-@ specific stage . A " Training Mode " is also available in which players can manipulate the environment and experiment against computer opponents without the restrictions of a standard match . 
 Up to four people can play in multiplayer mode , which has specific rules predetermined by the players . Stock and timed matches are two of the multiplayer modes of play . This gives each player a certain amount of lives or a selected time limit , before beginning the match . Free for all or team battles are also a choice during matches using stock or time . A winner is declared once time runs out , or if all players except one or a team has lost all of their lives . A multiplayer game may also end in a tie if two or more players have the same score when time expires , which causes the round to end in sudden death . 
 = = Characters = = 
 The game includes twelve playable characters originating from popular Nintendo franchises . Characters have a symbol appearing behind their damage meter corresponding to the series to which they belong , such as a Triforce behind Link 's and a Poké Ball emblem behind Pikachu 's . Furthermore , characters have recognizable moves derived from their original series , such as Samus 's charged blasters and Link 's arsenal of weapons . Eight characters are playable from the beginning of the game and the remaining four characters can then be unlocked by completing different tasks within the game . 
 The character art featured on the game 's box art and instruction manual is in the style of a comic book , and the characters are portrayed as toy dolls that come to life to fight . This presentational style has since been omitted in the sequels , which feature trophies instead of dolls and in @-@ game models rather than hand @-@ drawn art .

 Super Smash Bros. was developed by HAL Laboratory , a Nintendo second @-@ party developer , during 1998 . Masahiro Sakurai was interested in making a fighting game for four players . As he did not yet have any original ideas , his first designs were of simple base characters . He made a presentation of what was then called <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> ( Dragon King : The Fighting Game ) to co @-@ worker Satoru Iwata , who helped him continue . Sakurai understood that many fighting games did not sell well and that he had to think of a way to make his game original . His first idea was to include famous Nintendo characters and put them in a fight . Knowing he would not get permission , Sakurai made a prototype of the game without sanction from Nintendo and did not inform them until he was sure the game was well @-@ balanced . The prototype he presented featured Mario , Donkey Kong , Samus and Fox as playable characters . The idea was later approved . 
 Super Smash Bros. features music from some of Nintendo 's popular gaming franchises . While many are newly arranged for the game , some pieces are taken directly from their sources . The music for Super Smash Bros. was composed by Hirokazu Ando , who later returned as sound and music director for Super Smash Bros. Melee . A complete soundtrack was released on CD in Japan through <unk> Records in 2000 .

 Super Smash Bros. received mostly positive reviews , with criticism mostly directed towards the game 's single @-@ player mode . GameSpot 's former editorial director , Jeff Gerstmann , noted the single @-@ player game " won 't exactly last a long time " . Instead , he praised the multi @-@ player portion of the game , saying that it is " extremely simple to learn " . He called the game 's music " amazing " . IGN 's Peer Schneider agreed , calling the multiplayer mode " the game 's main selling point " , while GameCritics.com 's Dale Weir described Super Smash Bros. as " the most original fighting game on the market and possibly the best multiplayer game on any system " . Brad <unk> of Allgame said the game was designed for multiplayer battles , praising the simplicity of the controls and the fun element of the game . There were criticisms , however , such as the game 's scoring being difficult to follow . In addition , the single @-@ player mode was criticized for its perceived difficulty and lack of features . Schneider called Super Smash Bros. " an excellent choice for gamers looking for a worthy multiplayer smash ' em @-@ up " . Another IGN editor Matt Casamassina called it an incredibly addictive multiplayer game , but criticized the single @-@ player mode for not offering much of a challenge . It was given an Editors ' Choice award from IGN .

 " Raised by Another " is the tenth episode of the first season of the American drama series Lost . It first aired on December 1 , 2004 , on the American Broadcasting Company ( ABC ) . Directed by Marita <unk> and written by Lynne E. Litt , the episode was the first to reveal the backstory of Claire Littleton ( Emilie de Ravin ) . It also represented a shift from previous Lost backstories by being one of the first to emphasise the series ' mythology – a decision that made the network nervous at the time . 
 In this episode , flashbacks depict the story behind Claire 's pregnancy . Rejected by her boyfriend when he refused to raise their child , Claire decides to go to an adoption agency out of a belief that she will struggle to raise it alone . Claire visits a psychic ( Nick Jameson ) who warns her of a dangerous future for her unborn child if she does not raise it . In the present , Claire experiences terrifying nightmares and begins to suspect that somebody is trying to harm her unborn child . In response , Hurley ( Jorge Garcia ) decides to start a census of all of the survivors . 
 " Raised by Another " marks the revelation that Ethan ( William Mapother ) is not among the remaining survivors of Oceanic Flight 815 and is instead an outsider , revealed to be one of the Others alluded to in the previous episode . The final scene involving Claire and Charlie ( Dominic Monaghan ) being approached by Ethan was lauded by television commentators .

 Claire Littleton takes a pregnancy test with the assistance of her boyfriend , Thomas ( Keir O 'Donnell ) , and it is positive . Thomas reassures her that everything will be fine and that they will be good parents . Claire goes to a psychic , Richard Malkin ( Nick Jameson ) , who knows she is pregnant . After touching her hand , he has a supposed vision and becomes upset , but refuses to tell Claire what he " saw " . Later , Thomas tells Claire he is leaving , saying that he is not ready for the responsibility of a child . 
 Claire returns to the psychic and asks him for another reading . Richard knows that Thomas left her and says that Claire must raise the baby , as , if anyone else parents it , the baby will be in danger . Though the psychic repeatedly tells Claire not to give the child away , she tells him that she 's going to an adoptive services agency . Claire is about to sign papers so that a couple can adopt her baby , but none of the pens she tries work . After Claire thinks , she leaves the adoption agency and goes to the psychic . He gives her $ 6 @,@ 000 and a ticket on Oceanic Flight 815 , explaining that a couple in Los Angeles would adopt the baby and give her an additional $ 6 @,@ 000 . Initially Claire is skeptical about giving her child to complete strangers in Los Angeles , but Richard assures her that " they 're not strangers " and that they are " good people . " Even though Claire initially finds this change of heart suspicious , she accepts . 
 = = = On the Island = = = 
 It is Day 15 , October 6 , 2004 , and Claire wakes up from nightmares two nights in a row , screaming . In the first , Claire wakes to find herself no longer pregnant , as she walks into the forest and encounters John Locke ( Terry O 'Quinn ) at a table , playing cards . She asks him why he is there , but Locke interrupts , telling her " He was your responsibility , but you gave him away , Claire . Everyone pays the price now . " Locke looks up with one white and one black eye . She hears crying and finds a baby crib . After unfolding several layers of material she dips her hands into a pool of blood and then wakes screaming ; she has injured her hands by digging her nails deeply into her palms . In the second dream , someone holds Claire down and injects something into her stomach , though she has no wound . 
 Claire 's attack persuades Hugo " Hurley " Reyes ( Jorge Garcia ) to take a census of the survivors to have a clear idea of who actually resides on the island . The next day , while conducting his census , Hurley talks to Ethan Rom ( William Mapother ) , who seems concerned about giving his information to Hurley . Jack Shephard ( Matthew Fox ) suggests to Claire that she imagined the attack and offers her a sedative . Claire becomes upset that Jack does not believe her , deciding to leave the caves and move back to the beach . 
 Boone Carlyle ( Ian Somerhalder ) tells Hurley that James " Sawyer " Ford ( Josh Holloway ) has the flight manifest from the plane , and that could help him take the census . Sawyer uncharacteristically gives it to Hurley without any objection . While Charlie Pace ( Dominic Monaghan ) tries to help Claire move back to the beach , she starts having contractions . Charlie says he can deliver the baby , but after he accidentally confesses that he is a recovering drug addict , she yells at him to get Jack , which leaves her alone in the jungle . Charlie finds Ethan and tells him that Claire is in labor and to get Jack . Charlie goes back to comfort Claire , who tells him the story about the psychic . Charlie suggests that the psychic knew the flight was going to crash , and this was his way of forcing Claire to raise the baby by herself . Claire stops having contractions . 
 A badly wounded Sayid Jarrah ( Naveen Andrews ) returns to camp and tells the others about Danielle Rousseau ( Mira Furlan ) , and that other people live on the island , besides the plane survivors . Locke looks on from the shadows with his arms crossed . Hurley reveals to Jack that one of the survivors is not listed on the flight manifest , which means that someone was already on the island when the plane crashed . Claire 's contractions begin to stop . Claire and Charlie are then met by Ethan , who looks at them ominously . 
 = = Production = = 
 " Raised by Another " was written by consulting producer Lynne E. Litt . It was the first to feature Claire 's backstory before she arrived on the island . The episode 's story was developed in September 2004 , around the time that the series premiered on television . Series co @-@ creator Damon Lindelof later recalled that when the network realized Lost was going to be popular , they read the plans for " Raised by Another " and warned the writers not to endanger its success . 
 The first season contained flashbacks of main characters to develop their back stories to viewers . This approach was changed for " Raised by Another " , as the writers instead approached Claire 's flashbacks as a way to reveal the island 's mythology . According to Lindelof , " the network got really nervous , because that was a deep dive into mythology . " 
 The episode 's director , Marita <unk> , had worked with Lost co @-@ creator J.J. Abrams on the television series Alias . She met with him to discuss the episode 's tone , and they also regularly talked over the phone once filming began . She explained , " He was involved in every aspect of the outline , the first draft , the second draft , just constant phone calls back and forth because , basically the challenge of that show was making the schedule . " 
 Emilie de Ravin , an Australian actress , originally auditioned for the role of Shannon , speaking her dialogue with an American accent . Instead , they offered her the part of Claire ; she accepted without reading the script , assuming it would just be a recurring role . While de Ravin had never been pregnant , she was able to learn of the experience from her two older sisters . She found the hot weather conditions in Hawaii difficult , later saying that " in many ways , the filming is actually like the drama . You endure the <unk> weather in the rainforest ... You 're really exposed to the elements . " The actress admitted being " creeped out " by the premise of " Raised by Another " , in which a psychic tricks Claire by sending her to the island to raise her baby .

 " Raised by Another " first aired on December 1 , 2004 in the United States .

Among 18- to 49 @-@ year @-@ old viewers , the episode earned a rating of 5 @.@ 9 / 16 making it the eleventh highest of the week among that age demographic . 
 Writing for Entertainment Weekly , Whitney Pastorek called it " a decent episode made much , much better by its absolutely <unk> final moments . " Chris Carabott of IGN wrote in 2008 that while the episode was not the best of the first season , it was " noteworthy for its memorable reveal of the show 's first Other . " He praised the episode 's suspenseful climax , with Ethan 's revelation appearing alongside Sayid and Hurley warning them they are not alone . De Ravin 's performance was seen as another highlight . Zap2it columnist Ryan McGee , also writing in 2008 , praised the " stellar " episode for showing the first real antagonist of the series . McGee felt that Ethan 's reveal helped Lost turn " sharply in introducing an on @-@ Island , human threat for [ the ] survivors . " He concluded that it was among the top five best episodes of the first season . 
 Todd VanDerWerff of the Los Angeles Times rated the episode 58th of all Lost episodes ( apart from the series finale ) and commented positively on the " nicely spooky flashback to the psychic who was way too into getting her on that plane to L.A. " <unk> the episode in 2014 , Myles McNutt stated that " Solitary " and " Raised by Another " felt like " the first that go all @-@ in on Lost as a serialized mystery , " in part as Claire 's story is the first to reveal a character 's destined voyage to the island in the form of flashbacks . In 2014 , MTV columnist Josh Wigler ranked it as the 76th @-@ best Lost episode , stating that " Ethan Rom ’ s episode @-@ closing reveal is one of the <unk> moments of early Lost . " 
 = Josh Beckett = 
 Joshua Patrick Beckett ( born May 15 , 1980 ) is an American former professional baseball pitcher . A three @-@ time Major League Baseball ( MLB ) All @-@ Star , he played for the Florida Marlins , Boston Red Sox , and the Los Angeles Dodgers . 
 After a stellar high school career , where he was regarded as one of the top prospects in the country , he was drafted by the Marlins with the second pick in the 1999 MLB draft . He won the 2003 World Series with the Marlins and the 2007 World Series with the Red Sox , and received the 2007 American League Championship Most Valuable Player ( MVP ) award and the 2003 World Series MVP award . He was traded from the Marlins to the Red Sox in 2006 and from the Red Sox to the Dodgers in 2012 , both as part of multi @-@ player transactions . 
 Beckett recovered from a serious injury that caused him to miss most of the 2013 season and pitched a no hitter against the Philadelphia Phillies on May 25 , 2014 for the Dodgers , becoming the 19th man to do so in Dodgers history . However , his season was again cut short due to an injury and he announced his retirement on October 7 , 2014 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Beckett grew up idolizing fellow Texans Nolan Ryan and Roger Clemens . As a youth , he starred on Little League All @-@ Star teams . He later attended Spring High School in Spring , Texas . He had trouble with grades and not paying attention to his coach during his freshman year . His coach was so frustrated with him he threw him off the team . He went through a growth spurt before his sophomore year and added speed to his fastball . He also raised his GPA and was able to get back on the team , where he had a 9 – 3 record with a 1 @.@ 18 earned run average ( ERA ) as a sophomore , tossing three no @-@ hitters . 
 As a high school junior , Beckett was ranked by Baseball America as the top high school prospect in the country and his team as the top high school baseball team . He went 13 – 2 and struck out 2 @.@ 1 batters per inning while walking only 20 batters all season . His high school coach said " I ’ ve never seen a pitcher with his ability — ever . " 
 In his senior season , Beckett , by this point nicknamed " Kid Heat , " was named the High School player of the year by USA Today . Beckett signed a letter of intent to pitch for Texas A & M University , but he and Josh Hamilton were seen as the top two players available in the 1999 Major League Baseball draft . Concerned about Beckett 's perceived arrogance , the Tampa Bay Devil Rays picked Hamilton with the first pick . Beckett was selected with the second pick by the Florida Marlins . Marlins scouting director Al Avila said at the time , " Beckett has good size and has an overpowering fastball . He 's a bulldog on the mound . " Showing his confidence , Beckett predicted that he would make it to the Majors within two years and play in an All @-@ Star game by 2001 .

 Beckett engaged in protracted negotiations with the Marlins , during which he briefly enrolled at Blinn Junior College , but he eventually signed on August 28 , 1999 to a four @-@ year $ 7 million contract that included a $ 3 @.@ 625 million signing bonus . His signing bonus was larger than what the Marlins were paying everyone on the Major League roster , except pitcher Alex Fernandez . 
 Beckett impressed the Marlins in his first Spring training with the team in March 2000 , with a fastball clocked at 94 to 96 miles per hour ( 151 – 154 km / h ) and a good curveball . He also showed his commitment to the team by donating $ 100 @,@ 000 to the team 's charitable foundation , more than any other player had donated . He was assigned to the Kane County Cougars of the Class A Midwest League to make his professional debut . As the Opening Day starter for the Cougars , he pitched four innings and allowed only one run , on a double by Albert Pujols . Beckett suffered from injuries that season , including shoulder tendinitis and a frayed rotator cuff , injuries which took longer to heal because he did too much weight lifting while on the disabled list . He would later say , " I tried to get too strong too quick and ended up making things worse . " He pitched in 13 games for the Cougars and finished with a record of 2 – 3 with a 2 @.@ 12 ERA and 61 strikeouts . He was selected by Baseball America as the Marlins best prospect and the 19th best in the entire minor leagues as well as having the best fastball in the Midwest League . He was also selected to play in the All @-@ Star Futures Game , a showcase for the best prospects . 
 The Marlins assigned Beckett to the Brevard County Manatees of the Florida State League at the start of the 2001 season . He didn 't allow an earned run in his first 38 2 ⁄ 3 innings and went 6 – 0 with a 1 @.@ 23 ERA and 101 strikeouts in 13 games . Marlins General Manager Dave Dombrowski remarked on his progress , " He pitched as well in the Florida State League as any prospect I 've ever been associated with " , leading to a promotion to the Double A Portland Sea Dogs of the Eastern League . Beckett struck out eight of the first nine batters he faced in his Sea Dogs debut on June 16 , 2001 . On August 13 , 2001 he combined with two other Sea Dogs pitchers to throw a no @-@ hitter against the Binghamton Mets . In 13 starts for the team , he had an 8 – 1 record , a 1 @.@ 82 ERA and struck out 102 batters . 
 He was selected by Baseball America , USA Today , and the Sporting News as the " Minor League Player of the Year " . Baseball America also ranked him as the Marlins best prospect and the third best in all of baseball and the Marlins awarded him as their organizational minor league player of the year . 
 = = = = Major leagues = = = = 
 Beckett 's Major League debut was on September 4 , 2001 , against the Chicago Cubs , in which he gave up one hit over six shutout innings to pick up his first Major League win . He also doubled and scored in the game . Beckett was quoted afterwards as saying , " It was fun . I 'm ready for my next one . " He did not allow a run in his first 10 innings before giving up a two @-@ run homer to Vladimir Guerrero on September 19 against the Montreal Expos . He finished 2001 with four games started , a 2 – 2 record , and an ERA of 1 @.@ 50 . 
 Hampered by blister problems in 2002 , Beckett 's highlight was on July 21 , when he struck out 12 Expos in one game , combining with a couple of relief pitchers on a Marlins record 17 strikeouts in a nine @-@ inning game . In 23 appearances for the Marlins in 2002 , which included two relief appearances , he was 6 – 7 with a 4 @.@ 10 ERA and 113 strikeouts . 
 Beckett was named the Marlins opening day starting pitcher in 2003 , and at 23 years old was the youngest opening day starter in the team 's history . However , he lasted just 2 2 ⁄ 3 innings in the game as the Philadelphia Phillies scored five unearned runs in the third as a result of two errors and a passed ball . He subsequently went on the disabled list ( DL ) with a sprained right elbow in mid @-@ May , part of a string of team injuries that contributed to the firing of Manager Jeff Torborg . He returned from his injury on July 1 and finished the season with a 9 – 8 record , a 3 @.@ 04 ERA and 152 strikeouts . 
 Beckett made his postseason debut in the opening game of the 2003 National League ( NL ) Division Series , where he allowed only one run in seven innings against the San Francisco Giants but picked up the loss as Jason Schmidt pitched a complete game shutout . However , the Marlins came back to win the series in four games . His next start , in game one of the 2003 NL Championship Series against the Chicago Cubs , did not go well as he allowed four runs in the first inning , two of them on a home run by Moisés Alou , and six runs in his 6 1 ⁄ 3 innings . The Marlins battled back and won the game in extra innings . The Cubs took the next three games and only needed one more win to take the series when Beckett returned to the mound in game five . He allowed only three Cubs to reach base in the game , on two singles and a walk , in the complete game shutout to keep his team alive . The Marlins took game six also , thanks partly to the infamous Steve Bartman incident . In game seven , on two days rest , Beckett came in out of the bullpen to pitch four innings and the Marlins won 9 – 6 to clinch the National League championship . 
 Beckett won the 2003 World Series MVP Award with two strong performances on three days ' rest as the Marlins defeated the New York Yankees . In game three , he struck out 10 and allowed only two runs in 7 1 ⁄ 3 innings and then in game six at Yankee Stadium , he shut out the Yankees in a complete game , striking out nine batters and clinching the series by making the tag for the final out . 
 Beckett made the opening day start for the Marlins again in 2004 , allowing one run in seven innings against the Expos . He made three trips to the DL during the season , but still pitched a career high 26 starts and 156 2 ⁄ 3 innings . He was 9 – 9 with a 3 @.@ 79 ERA and had 152 strikeouts for the second year in a row but the Marlins faltered down the stretch and did not make the postseason . In 2005 , he was 15 – 8 with a 3 @.@ 38 ERA and 166 strikeouts in 29 games . 
 In his five seasons with the Marlins , Beckett had a 41 – 34 record , a 3 @.@ 46 ERA and struck out a total of 607 batters in 106 games . In his final start as a Marlin , on September 23 , 2005 , against the Atlanta Braves , he struck out six in seven shutout innings but earned a no decision in a game the Marlins eventually lost . 
 = = = Boston Red Sox ( 2006 – 2012 ) = = = 
 In a deal that was made official on Thanksgiving Day 2005 , Beckett was traded to the Boston Red Sox along with third baseman Mike Lowell and relief pitcher Guillermo Mota for minor league shortstop Hanley Ramírez ( the top prospect in the Red Sox system at the time ) and pitchers Aníbal Sánchez , Jesús Delgado and Harvey García . Beckett and Lowell were among a prominent list of veterans the Marlins traded in an effort to shed salary . This was organizationally termed a market correction . In his first start with the Red Sox , Beckett allowed only one run in seven innings to pick up the win against the Texas Rangers on April 5 , 2006 . 
 Beckett was the first Red Sox pitcher to hit a home run in 35 years — since the advent of the designated hitter rule — when he took Phillies ' pitcher Brett Myers deep during an interleague game on May 20 , 2006 . On July 18 , he signed a three @-@ year , $ 30 million contract extension with a $ 10 million club option for 2010 . Beckett completed his first season with the Red Sox with a record of 16 – 11 and a 5 @.@ 01 ERA . In 204 2 ⁄ 3 innings , he gave up 191 hits and struck out 158 batters while walking 74 . He also allowed 36 home runs , tied for second most in the majors . 
 At the start of the 2007 season , Beckett adjusted to throwing more breaking pitches and fewer fastballs . At the same time , he learned to locate his pitches rather than simply get strikes by power . He reduced his walks and home runs allowed by nearly half , contributing to his success in 2007 . Beckett became one of six Red Sox pitchers in history to win their first seven starts . George Winter and Mickey Harris both won their first seven starts in a season , and Babe Ruth , Dave Ferriss and Roger Moret all won their first eight starts in a season . After a strong first half , posting a 12 – 2 record with a 3 @.@ 44 ERA , he was selected to the American League team in the 2007 MLB All @-@ Star Game . Beckett earned the victory in the game after pitching two innings , giving up only one hit , and striking out two . Beckett became the first pitcher to win 20 games in a season since 2005 , finishing the season with a record of 20 – 7 , a 3 @.@ 27 ERA , 194 strikeouts , a 1 @.@ 14 WHIP , and only 40 walks and 17 home runs allowed . 
 Beckett started the first game of the 2007 American League Championship Series ( ALCS ) and pitched six innings for the win and in game five he struck out 11 in eight innings . Beckett 's 2 – 0 record and 1 @.@ 93 ERA against the Cleveland Indians earned him the 2007 ALCS MVP Award . He then started and won the first game of the 2007 World Series against the Colorado Rockies , pitching seven innings , allowing one run on six hits , and striking out nine batters . Boston would go on to sweep the Rockies in the series . 
 On May 8 , 2008 , Beckett recorded his 1,000th career strikeout , when Brandon Inge of the Detroit Tigers struck out swinging in the seventh inning . He was 12 – 10 with a 4 @.@ 03 ERA in 27 starts . In game three of the 2008 American League Division Series against the Anaheim Angels he allowed four runs in five innings He then made two starts in the 2008 ALCS against the Tampa Bay Rays and was 1 – 0 but had a high 9 @.@ 64 ERA . 
 In 2009 , during his first Opening Day start with the Red Sox , Beckett struck out 10 through seven innings allowing only one run and two hits in a 5 – 3 victory over the Rays . On April 14 , 2009 , MLB fined and suspended him six games for intentionally throwing over the head of Angels outfielder Bobby Abreu . Beckett later appealed the suspension and got it reduced to five games . On June 20 , 2009 , he recorded his first complete game shutout in three years against the Atlanta Braves in a duel against former Red Sox pitcher Derek Lowe . The shutout was his first in a Red Sox uniform . On July 5 , 2009 , he was selected to represent Boston in the 2009 MLB All Star Game . 
 Beckett recorded his 100th career win on July 12 , 2009 , pitching a complete game shutout against the Kansas City Royals at Fenway Park . On August 7 , 2009 , against the New York Yankees , he engaged in a pitching duel with former Marlins teammate A. J. Burnett that turned into a fifteen @-@ inning , five @-@ hour @-@ and @-@ thirty @-@ three @-@ minute game . He threw seven shutout innings , Burnett threw seven and two thirds . The Red Sox eventually lost the game in the bottom of the 15th , when Alex Rodriguez hit a walk @-@ off two run home run . He was 17 – 6 on the season , with a 3 @.@ 86 ERA in 32 starts . He lost his one start in the postseason , to the Angels in game two of the 2009 ALDS . 
 On April 5 , 2010 , the Red Sox and Beckett agreed to a four @-@ year , $ 68 million contract extension , through 2014 . On May 7 , he allowed nine runs , struck out eight and also hit two batters . This was the first time a Major League pitcher had that combination of stats in a single game since Jack Coombs of the Philadelphia Athletics during the 1911 season . He was placed on the disabled list on May 19 with a lower back strain and returned from the injury on July 23 . On September 16 , he recorded his 1,000th strikeout as a member of the Red Sox against Tampa Bay 's Ben Zobrist in the sixth inning . In 21 starts in 2010 , he was 6 – 6 with a 5 @.@ 78 ERA . 
 In 2011 he posted career highs in ERA ( 2 @.@ 89 ) , opponent batting average ( .211 ) and WHIP ( 1 @.@ 03 ) . He was 13 – 7 in 30 games and was selected to his third All @-@ Star Game . At the end of the 2011 season , the Red Sox stumbled and failed to make the playoffs . Beckett and two more starting pitchers ( John Lackey and Jon Lester ) were in the center of a controversy where the three drank alcohol during games , where they weren 't pitching , and also ate fried chicken and played video games . Beckett was noted as the leader of this and some cited this behavior as part of the reason for the team 's poor play down the stretch . 
 Beckett struggled in the 2012 season , he went 5 – 11 with a 5 @.@ 23 ERA as a Red Sox . He was also the center of yet another controversy when it was reported that he played several rounds of golf despite having been scratched from his start due to a lat muscle injury . In what would turn out to be his final start with the Red Sox , he allowed four runs in six innings on August 19 , 2012 against the Yankees . Over seven seasons , he started 194 regular season games for the Red Sox with a 89 – 58 record , a 4 @.@ 17 ERA and 1 @,@ 108 strikeouts . 
 = = = Los Angeles Dodgers ( 2012 – 2014 ) = = = 
 On August 25 , 2012 , he was traded to the Los Angeles Dodgers ( along with Adrian Gonzalez , Carl Crawford and Nick Punto and $ 11 million in cash ) for James Loney , Iván <unk> , Jr . , Allen Webster , and two players to be named later ( Jerry Sands and <unk> De La Rosa ) . He started seven games for the Dodgers after the trade and was 2 – 3 with a 2 @.@ 93 ERA . 
 Beckett struggled in the early part of the 2013 season with an 0 – 5 record and 5 @.@ 19 ERA in eight starts . He was placed on the disabled list with a groin strain on May 15 . While on the disabled list he began to experience numbness and tingling in his hand so he went to see a nerve specialist and expressed doubt as to whether he would be able to pitch again . The Dodgers shut him down from pitching for a month while he underwent a rigorous rehabilitation program in an effort to avoid season @-@ ending surgery . However , the tingling sensation returned when he attempted to resume his throwing program in late June . He was diagnosed with thoracic outlet syndrome , which required him to undergo surgery on July 10 , 2013 that ended his 2013 season . 
 Beckett 's surgery , which included his having a rib removed , made him a question mark for the Dodgers heading into 2014 . He returned to the Dodgers on April 9 and made his first start since the previous May , allowing four runs in four innings . On May 13 , he picked up his first win since 2012 . 
 On May 25 , 2014 , Beckett pitched a no @-@ hitter against the Philadelphia Phillies at Citizens Bank Park , the 21st no @-@ hitter in Dodgers history , and the first since Hideo Nomo did so in the 1996 season . He threw 128 pitches , struck out six , and walked three en route to the victory . Beckett also became the oldest pitcher ( 34 ) to throw a no hitter since Randy Johnson ( 40 ) threw a perfect game in 2004 . He was honored as the National League Player of the Week as a result of that game . 
 On July 8 , 2014 , Beckett landed on the disabled list with a left hip impingement , an injury he said had gotten worse as the season went on . He returned to the rotation on July 22 , but struggled when he returned . In a start on August 3 , he was only able to pitch four innings against the Cubs . Afterward , Beckett told the team that he had experienced renewed discomfort in his injured hip . An MRI revealed that his hip impingement had resulted in a torn labrum and two cysts , possibly requiring season ending surgery . He was placed back on the 15 @-@ day disabled list on August 8 . On September 3 , 2014 , Dodgers manager Don Mattingly told reporters that Beckett 's season was likely over due to his injury . A couple of days later , Beckett confirmed that he would not pitch again in 2014 and added that he was also considering retirement . Beckett officially announced his retirement on October 7 , 2014 .

 Beckett threw five pitches regularly : a four @-@ seam fastball ( 91 to 94 miles per hour ( 146 – 151 km / h ) ) , a two @-@ seam fastball ( 91 to 94 miles per hour ( 146 – 151 km / h ) ) , a cutter ( 89 to 91 miles per hour ( 143 – 146 km / h ) ) , a curveball ( 73 to 79 miles per hour ( 117 – 127 km / h ) ) , and a changeup ( 86 to 88 miles per hour ( 138 – 142 km / h ) ) . Beckett uses all five of his pitches against left @-@ handed hitters but drops the changeup against righties . He tends to use his curveball when ahead in the count , bolstered by its 34 % whiff rate . Beckett also began to experiment with a slider and splitter in 2012 .

 Beckett has been linked to such celebrities as model / <unk> Leeann Tweeden and country singer Danielle Peck . On October 18 , 2007 , Peck was invited by the Cleveland Indians to sing the National Anthem prior to Game 5 of the American League Championship Series between the Red Sox and Indians . Beckett was the starting pitcher in that game , and some Red Sox fans theorized that her invitation was an attempt by the Indians organization to distract Beckett . The Indians denied this claim . It did not seem to affect Beckett , as he beat the Indians with eight innings pitched , five hits , one walk , one earned run , and eleven strikeouts . In a postgame interview with Beckett , when asked if he was affected by Peck 's presence , Beckett replied , " I don 't get paid to make those decisions . She 's a friend of mine . It doesn 't bother me at all . Thanks for flyin ' one of my friends to the game so she could watch it for free . " On January 22 , 2011 , he married Holly Fisher , an aeronautics engineer and former high school classmate . Josh and Holly have two daughters , <unk> and Sage . 
 Beckett is an avid deer hunter and has been since childhood . He was the 2002 winner of the Muy Grande Deer Contest for bringing down the largest buck during the Texas deer hunting season . He owns <unk> Ranch , a 7 @,@ 000 acres ( 28 km2 ) deer @-@ hunting ranch outside of <unk> , Texas . 
 He was featured in a Kevin Fowler music video alongside his teammates John Lackey , Tim Wakefield , Jon Lester and Clay Buchholz . 
 = Cyril Bassett = 
 Cyril Royston Guyton Bassett VC ( 3 January 1892 – 9 January 1983 ) was a New Zealand recipient of the Victoria Cross ( VC ) , the highest award for gallantry in the face of the enemy that can be awarded to British and Commonwealth forces . He was the first and only New Zealander to be awarded the VC in the Gallipoli Campaign of the First World War . 
 Born in Auckland , Bassett was a bank worker when the First World War began . A member of New Zealand 's Territorial Force , he volunteered for service abroad with the New Zealand Expeditionary Force ( NZEF ) and was posted to the New Zealand Divisional Signal Company as a sapper . He saw action on the opening day of the Gallipoli Campaign , and it was during the Battle of Chunuk Bair that he performed the actions that led to his award of the VC . Medically evacuated due to sickness shortly after the battle , he later served on the Western Front and finished the war as a second lieutenant . He returned to the banking profession but was recalled to active duty during the Second World War . He served on the Home Front and by the time he was taken off active duty in December 1943 , he had been promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel and was commander of signals in the Northern Military District . When he retired from his banking career he became a justice of the peace in Devonport . He died in 1983 at the age of 91 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Cyril Bassett was born on 3 January 1892 in Auckland , New Zealand to a printer , Frederick Bassett , and his wife , Harriet . After completing his formal education , Bassett worked as a clerk for the National Bank of New Zealand . In 1909 , he joined what later became the Territorial Force and was assigned to the Auckland College Rifles . Two years later he transferred to the Auckland Divisional Signal Company . 
 = = First World War = = 
 When the First World War broke out , it was Bassett 's intention to join the Royal Navy . However , his mother , who was from a family with a history of service in the British Army , convinced him to enlist in the New Zealand Military Forces . Bassett was not particularly tall and was initially rejected due to his lack of height . He persisted with his attempt to enlist , and eventually joined the New Zealand Expeditionary Force ( NZEF ) as a sapper in the Corps of New Zealand Engineers , assigned to the New Zealand Divisional Signal Company . 
 Bassett embarked with the main body of the NZEF for the Middle East in October 1914 . Initially based in Egypt , after a period of training , he landed at ANZAC Cove on 25 April 1915 , the opening day of the Gallipoli Campaign . Along with the other signallers of his unit , he was immediately set to work laying communication lines . In early May , his courage under fire was noted in consideration for a gallantry award . 
 Later in the campaign , Bassett was promoted to corporal . In August 1915 , a series of offensives against Turkish positions along the Gallipoli front were planned to break the stalemate that had developed since the initial landing . On 7 August , the New Zealand Infantry Brigade attacked Chunuk Bair , a prominent hill overlooking the battlefield . The battle lasted for three days , with Chunuk Bair captured by the brigade 's Wellington Infantry Battalion on the second day , during which Bassett , in command of a section of five other signallers of his unit , laid down and maintained telephone lines between brigade headquarters and the front lines . He braved continuous gunfire during this time . Although not wounded , two bullets passed through the fabric of his tunic during the fighting . After the battle , his name , along with those of the other five signallers of his section , was collected by Major Arthur Temperley of brigade headquarters , who nominated Bassett for the Victoria Cross ( VC ) . 
 The citation for Bassett 's Victoria Cross read as follows : 
 No. 4 / 515 Corporal Cyril Royston Guyton Bassett , New Zealand Divisional Signal Company . For most conspicuous bravery and devotion to duty on the Chunuk Bair ridge in the Gallipoli Peninsula on 7th August , 1915 . After the New Zealand Infantry Brigade had attacked and established itself on the ridge , Corporal Bassett , in full daylight and under a continuous and heavy fire , succeeded in laying a telephone line from the old position to the new one on Chunuk Bair . He has subsequently been brought to notice for further excellent and most gallant work connected with the repair of telephone lines by day and night under heavy fire . 
 The citation incorrectly refers to Bassett 's actions on 7 August ; it was not until the following day that the Wellington Infantry Battalion captured Chunuk Bair . A few days after the battle , Bassett was evacuated from Gallipoli due to poor health . Suffering from dysentery , he spent several months recuperating in England . In June 1916 , he rejoined his unit , by then on the Western Front in France as part of the New Zealand Division . Later that year , he participated in the Battle of the Somme and in 1917 was commissioned as a second lieutenant . He was wounded twice during his time in France . He returned to New Zealand in late 1918 as the New Zealand Division started demobilising and was formally discharged from the NZEF in 1919 .

 Bassett returned to his banking career after the war , managing branches of the National Bank in Auckland and later in <unk> . He retained a link to the military , rejoining the Territorial Force but was placed on the retired list of officers in 1929 . By 1939 he was manager of the Auckland Town Hall branch of the National Bank . He had also married , his union with Ruth Louise Grant producing two daughters . 
 = = Second World War = = 
 Called up for the National Military Reserve as a result of the outbreak of the Second World War , Bassett was placed on active duty in 1941 as a captain in the Royal New Zealand Corps of Signals . He was not required to serve overseas and instead he worked in signals while remaining in New Zealand . Promoted to major in February 1942 , his active war service ended in December 1943 . By then he had achieved the rank of lieutenant colonel and was commander of signals in the Northern Military District . 
 = = Later life and legacy = = 
 Bassett returned to the National Military Reserve from which he eventually retired in 1948 . As a civilian , he once again resumed his banking profession . He retired in 1952 but remained active in the community of Devonport , Auckland as a justice of the peace . He died in Stanley Bay , Auckland on 9 January 1983 , shortly after his 91st birthday , and his ashes were buried at North Shore Memorial Park . He was survived by his two daughters and his wife . His VC , gifted to the Corps of Signals upon his death , is displayed at the Auckland War Memorial Museum . 
 According to his daughter , Bassett rarely spoke about his achievements as " It just wasn 't done " , and in fact , she did not learn of her father 's award until she studied Gallipoli at primary school . He was modest of his achievements and expressed embarrassment at being the only New Zealand VC recipient of the Gallipoli Campaign . 
 Bassett remains the only signaller to have been awarded the VC and was a lifetime member of the Corps of Signals Association . In recognition of Bassett 's rank at the time he won the VC , the Bassett Memorial Trophy is awarded annually to the most outstanding corporal in the Corps of Signals . The trophy is a statue of Bassett on Chunuk Bair . 
 = Italian battleship Vittorio Veneto = 
 Vittorio Veneto was the second member of the Littorio class of battleships that served in the Italian Regia Marina ( Royal Navy ) during World War II . Her keel was laid down in October 1934 , she was launched in July 1937 , and she was readied for service with the Italian fleet by August 1940 . She was named after the Italian victory at Vittorio Veneto during World War I , and she had three sister ships : Littorio , Roma , and Impero , though only Littorio and Roma were completed during the war . She was armed with a main battery of nine 381 @-@ millimeter ( 15 @.@ 0 in ) guns in three triple turrets , and could steam at a speed of 30 knots ( 56 km / h ; 35 mph ) . 
 Vittorio Veneto saw extensive service during the war and participated in the Battle of Cape Spartivento in November 1940 and the Battle of Cape Matapan in March 1941 . She was damaged by torpedoes several times , including in the engagement off Cape Matapan and by the British submarine HMS Urge in December 1941 , though she escaped undamaged during the British raid on Taranto in November 1940 . She spent 1941 and early 1942 attempting to attack British convoys to Malta , but crippling fuel shortages in the Italian fleet curtailed activity thereafter . Vittorio Veneto was among the Italian ships that were surrendered to the Allies in September 1943 after Italy withdrew from the war , and she spent the following three years under British control in Egypt . After the war , she was allocated as a war prize to Britain and subsequently broken up for scrap .

 Vittorio Veneto was 237 @.@ 76 meters ( 780 @.@ 1 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 32 @.@ 82 m ( 107 @.@ 7 ft ) and a draft of 9 @.@ 6 m ( 31 ft ) . She was designed with a standard displacement of 40 @,@ 724 long tons ( 41 @,@ 377 t ) , a violation of the 35 @,@ 000 @-@ long @-@ ton ( 36 @,@ 000 t ) restriction of the Washington Naval Treaty ; at full combat loading , she displaced 45 @,@ 236 long tons ( 45 @,@ 962 t ) . The ship was powered by four Belluzo geared steam turbines rated at 128 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 95 @,@ 000 kW ) . Steam was provided by eight oil @-@ fired Yarrow boilers . The engines provided a top speed of 30 knots ( 56 km / h ; 35 mph ) and a range of 3 @,@ 920 mi ( 6 @,@ 310 km ; 3 @,@ 410 nmi ) at 20 kn ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) . Vittorio Veneto had a crew of 1 @,@ 830 to 1 @,@ 950 over the course of her career . 
 Vittorio Veneto 's main armament consisted of nine 381 @-@ millimeter ( 15 @.@ 0 in ) 50 @-@ caliber Model 1934 guns in three triple turrets ; two turrets were placed forward in a superfiring arrangement and the third was located aft . Her secondary anti @-@ surface armament consisted of twelve 152 mm ( 6 @.@ 0 in ) / 55 Model 1934 / 35 guns in four triple turrets amidships . These were supplemented by four 120 mm ( 4 @.@ 7 in ) / 40 Model 1891 / 92 guns in single mounts ; these guns were old weapons and were primarily intended to fire star shells . Vittorio Veneto was equipped with an anti @-@ aircraft battery that comprised twelve 90 mm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) / 53 Model 1939 guns in single mounts , twenty 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) / 54 guns in eight twin and four single mounts , and sixteen 20 mm ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) / 65 guns in eight twin mounts . EC 3 ter <unk> radar , which could detect surface targets at a range of 30 kilometers ( 19 mi ) and aircraft at 80 km ( 50 mi ) , was installed in July 1943 . 
 The ship was protected by a main armored belt that was 280 mm ( 11 in ) with a second layer of steel that was 70 mm ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) thick . The main deck was 162 mm ( 6 @.@ 4 in ) thick in the central area of the ship and reduced to 45 mm ( 1 @.@ 8 in ) in less critical areas . The main battery turrets were 350 mm ( 14 in ) thick and the lower turret structure was housed in barbettes that were also 350 mm thick . The secondary turrets had 280 mm thick faces and the conning tower had 260 mm ( 10 in ) thick sides . Vittorio Veneto was fitted with a catapult on her stern and equipped with three IMAM Ro.43 reconnaissance float planes or Reggiane Re.2000 fighters .

 = = = Construction = = = 
 Vittorio Veneto was ordered under the 1934 construction program , and was named for the Battle of Vittorio Veneto , a decisive Italian victory over the Austro @-@ Hungarian Empire in October – November 1918 during World War I. Her keel was laid on 28 October 1934 at Cantieri Riuniti dell 'Adriatico in Trieste , the same day as her sister ship Littorio . Vittorio Veneto was launched on 25 July 1937 , and major construction was completed by October 1939 . The fitting @-@ out process was greatly delayed due to repeated changes to the design and shortages of heavy armor plate . Before she could begin sea trials , Vittorio Veneto was moved to Venice on 4 October to have her bottom cleaned of the fouling that had accumulated during the long fitting @-@ out period , since the Venice Arsenal had the only drydock in Italy long enough to accommodate a ship the size of the Littorio class . 
 On 17 October , with the cleaning completed , the dockyard personnel flooded the drydock to conduct stability tests . The new battleship moved to Trieste on 19 October , and her trials began on 23 October . The trials , which also included tests for the ship 's weaponry , lasted until March 1940 , after which some additional fitting @-@ out work was completed . She was delivered on 28 April , though she was not yet complete . On 1 May , Vittorio Veneto was sent to La Spezia for final fitting @-@ out work , escorted by the destroyers Leone <unk> and Emanuele Pessagno . On 6 May , she was loaded with shells for her main battery ; the loading work for the main and secondary guns lasted until 20 May . Later that day , she was transferred to Taranto , escorted by the destroyers Ascari and <unk> , where she joined the 9th Division of the Italian fleet . The following month , Italy joined the war against Britain and France , though it wasn 't until 2 August that Vittorio Veneto and Littorio were formally declared operational . 
 = = = World War II = = = 
 On 31 August – 2 September 1940 , Vittorio Veneto sortied as part of an Italian force of five battleships , ten cruisers , and thirty @-@ four destroyers to intercept British naval forces taking part in Operation Hats and Convoy <unk> , but contact was not made with either group due to poor aerial reconnaissance and no action occurred . In addition , British aerial reconnaissance detected the oncoming Italian fleet and was able to escape . On 6 September , the fleet sortied again to attack a British force that had been reported leaving Gibraltar , but the British ships instead steamed south into the Atlantic . A similar outcome resulted from the movement against British Operation " MB.5 " on 29 September - 1 October ; Vittorio Veneto , four other battleships , eleven cruisers , and twenty @-@ three destroyers had attempted to intercept the convoy carrying troops to Malta . In this operation , the Italian Regia Aeronautica ( Royal Air Force ) did locate the convoy , but the British were able to evade the Italian fleet . 
 On the night of 10 – 11 November , the British Mediterranean Fleet launched an air raid on the harbor in Taranto . Twenty @-@ one Swordfish torpedo bombers launched from the aircraft carrier HMS Illustrious attacked the Italian fleet in two waves . The Italian base was defended by twenty @-@ one 90 mm anti @-@ aircraft guns and dozens of smaller 37 mm and 20 mm guns , along with twenty @-@ seven barrage balloons . The defenders did not possess radar , however , and so were caught by surprise when the Swordfish arrived . The first wave struck at 20 : 35 , followed by the second about an hour later . Vittorio Veneto was undamaged in the attack , but three other battleships were hit , two of which were severely damaged . The morning after the Taranto raid , Vittorio Veneto led the Italian fleet to Naples . There , she took over the role of fleet flagship , under the command of Admiral Inigo Campioni . 
 = = = = Battle of Cape Spartivento = = = = 
 On 17 November , Vittorio Veneto and Giulio Cesare — the only operational Italian battleships — participated in an attempt to intercept the British Operation White convoy to Malta , though the forces made no contact . On 26 November , the Italian fleet made another attempt to attack a British convoy , Operation Collar , which resulted in the Battle of Cape Spartivento ( known as the Battle of Cape <unk> to the Italians ) . Vittorio Veneto , Giulio Cesare , six cruiser , and fourteen destroyers attempted to catch a convoy steaming to Malta . The British escort included the aircraft carrier Ark Royal , the battleship Ramillies , and the battlecruiser Renown ; Italian aerial reconnaissance detected the escorts but exaggerated their strength and Campioni , under orders to not risk his two operational battleships against equal or stronger opponents , broke off the engagement shortly after it began . Vittorio Veneto briefly engaged several British cruisers and slightly damaged the light cruiser Manchester . During the engagement , Ark Royal launched torpedo bombers against Vittorio Veneto , but the latter successfully evaded the torpedoes . 
 Repeated British air attacks on Naples , one of which damaged the cruiser Pola , prompted the high command to move Vittorio Veneto and the rest of the major warships of the fleet to Sardinia on 14 December . They were returned to Naples six days later , however , after the high command concluded that removing the fleet to Sardinia would allow British convoys from Alexandria to reach Malta with relative ease . On the night of 8 – 9 January 1941 , the British launched an air raid with Vickers Wellington bombers on the Italian fleet in Naples , but the aircraft again failed to hit Vittorio Veneto ; Giulio Cesare was slightly damaged by several near misses . Both ships were moved to La Spezia the next day , with Vittorio Veneto providing cover for Giulio Cesare . Vittorio Veneto was now the only operational battleship in the fleet . Giulio Cesare was back in service by early February , as was Andrea Doria . The three battleships , along with eight destroyers , attempted to intercept Force H on 8 February , which was en route to bombard Genoa . The two forces did not encounter each other , and the Italian fleet returned to La Spezia . 
 = = = = Battle of Cape Matapan = = = = 
 Vittorio Veneto returned to Naples on 22 March , and four days later led an attempt to attack British shipping off Greece , in company with eight cruisers and nine destroyers . The fleet would be supported by the Regia Aeronautica and the German Fliegerkorps X ( 10th Air Corps ) . This operation resulted in the Battle of Cape Matapan ; the engagement began when the Italian 3rd Division — comprising the two Trento @-@ class heavy cruisers and Bolzano and commanded by Vice Admiral Luigi <unk> — encountered the British 15th Cruiser Squadron . Iachino attempted to maneuver Vittorio Veneto to the east of the British cruisers while they were distracted with <unk> 's cruisers , but HMS Orion spotted the battleship before she could close the trap . Vittorio Veneto immediately opened fire and quickly found the range , but only inflicted splinter damage on Orion , which fled to the south , back toward the main British fleet . <unk> in Vittorio Veneto 's forward @-@ most turret forced her to cease firing temporarily . The Italian gunners quickly returned the guns to action , however , and resumed their bombardment of the British cruisers . Poor visibility and smokescreens hampered the accuracy of Vittorio Veneto 's gunners and they scored no hits , though they straddled the cruisers several times . In the course of this phase of the battle , she had fired 92 rounds from her main battery . 
 During this period of the battle , torpedo bombers from the carrier HMS Formidable arrived on the scene , and their attack forced Vittorio Veneto to break off the engagement with the British cruisers to take evasive action . She evaded the torpedoes , but the attack convinced Iachino that the Mediterranean Fleet was at sea , which prompted him to end the operation and return to port . The British launched several air attacks against the Italian fleet in an attempt to slow down Vittorio Veneto , including land @-@ based Blenheim bombers from Greece and Crete . Later in the afternoon Formidable launched a second strike , and at 15 : 10 one of her Swordfish hit Vittorio Veneto on her port side , aft . The Italian anti @-@ aircraft gunners shot the plane down after it launched its torpedo . The hit sheared off the port side propeller , damaged the shaft , jammed the port rudder , and disabled the aft port pumps . It also caused severe flooding — some 4 @,@ 000 long tons ( 4 @,@ 100 t ) of water entered the ship — which gave her a 4 – 4 @.@ 5 degree list to port , and forced her to stop for about ten minutes . While she was immobilized , a Blenheim bomber dropped a bomb that landed near her stern ; the blast caused further , minor damage to stern . 
 The damage control parties had great difficulty in controlling and reducing the flooding , since they could only use emergency hand pumps . Some forward and starboard voids were counter @-@ flooded to reduce the list . In the meantime , engine room personnel were able to restart the starboard shafts and steering could be effected with the backup hand @-@ steering gear . After she got back underway , she was able to slowly increase her speed to 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) using only her starboard shafts . While the Italian fleet was withdrawing , Formidable launched another air strike of nine Swordfish in an attempt to slow Vittorio Veneto down . But instead of hitting the Italian battleship , they struck the cruiser Pola , leaving her dead in the water . Vittorio Veneto returned to port while two cruisers and several destroyers were detached to protect Pola ; all three cruisers and two destroyers were sunk in a furious night action at very close range with the battleships Valiant , Warspite , and Barham . Vittorio Veneto meanwhile reached Taranto on 29 March , where repairs lasted until July . She was not fully operational again until August . 
 = = = = Later operations = = = = 
 Vittorio Veneto and Littorio participated in an unsuccessful sortie to intercept British forces on 22 – 25 August . The British had intended to mine Livorno and launch an air raid on northern Sardinia , but Italian agents in Spain warned the Regia Marina of the British operation when it departed Gibraltar . The Italian fleet positioned itself too far to the south , however , and aerial reconnaissance failed to locate the British . A month later , Vittorio Veneto led the attack on the Allied convoy in Operation Halberd on 27 September 1941 , in company with Littorio , five cruisers , and fourteen destroyers . The British had hoped to lure out the Italian fleet and attack it with a powerful convoy escort centered on the battleships Rodney , Nelson , and Prince of Wales . It too ended without contact with the British fleet ; neither side located the other , but Italian torpedo bombers hit Nelson . At 14 : 00 , Iachino cancelled the operation and ordered the fleet to return to port . 
 On 13 December , she participated in another operation to escort a convoy to North Africa , but the attempt was broken off after a British radio deception effort convinced the Italians that the British fleet was in the area . While returning to port the following day , Vittorio Veneto was torpedoed by the British submarine HMS Urge in the Straits of Messina . Urge fired a spread of three torpedoes , but only one hit on her port side . The torpedo tore a hole 13 m ( 43 ft ) long and caused over 2 @,@ 000 metric tons ( 2 @,@ 000 long tons ; 2 @,@ 200 short tons ) of water to flood the ship , though the ship 's Pugliese torpedo defense system successfully contained the explosion . Vittorio Veneto took on a 3 @.@ 5 degree list to port and was down by 2 @.@ 2 m ( 7 ft 3 in ) by the stern . Some counter flooding of a compartment on the starboard side abreast of the forward @-@ most turret reduced the list by a degree , and she was able to steam under her own power back to port . She returned to Taranto for repairs , which lasted until early 1942 . 
 On 14 June , Littorio participated in the interception of the Operation Vigorous convoy to Malta from Alexandria . Littorio , Vittorio Veneto , four cruisers and twelve destroyers were sent to attack the convoy . The British quickly located the approaching Italian fleet and launched several air strikes early on 15 June with Wellington and Bristol Beaufort bombers in an attempt to prevent them from reaching the convoy . The aircraft scored no hits on the battleships , but they did disable the cruiser Trento , which was later sunk by a British submarine . Later that morning another air attack , this time B @-@ 24 Liberators from the USAAF , occurred . The high @-@ level bombers scored one hit on Littorio and several near misses around her and Vittorio Veneto , but neither ship was seriously damaged . Another British strike with Beauforts arrived shortly thereafter , but Italian and German fighters had since arrived and they shot down two Beauforts and damaged five others . By the afternoon , Iachino had concluded that he would not reach the convoy before dark , and so he broke off the operation . On the return voyage , another British air attack succeeded in torpedoing <unk> .

 On 12 November , Vittorio Veneto was moved to Naples from Taranto in response to the Allied invasion of North Africa . While en route , the British submarine HMS Umbra unsuccessfully attacked Vittorio Veneto . An American air raid on the harbor on 4 December prompted the Italians to withdraw the fleet to La Spezia , where it remained for the rest of Italy 's active participation in the war . On 5 June 1943 , Vittorio Veneto was badly damaged by an American air raid on La Spezia ; she was hit by two large bombs toward the bow , though only one detonated . That bomb passed through the ship and exploded under the hull , causing serious structural damage . The damage forced her to be transferred to Genoa for repair work , since the dockyard in La Spezia had also been damaged by the attack . On 3 September , Italy signed an armistice with the Allies , ending her active participation in World War II . Six days later , Vittorio Veneto and the rest of the Italian fleet sailed for Malta , where they would be taken into internment for the remainder of the war . While en route , the German Luftwaffe ( Air Force ) attacked the Italian fleet using Dornier Do 217s armed with Fritz X radio @-@ controlled bombs . Vittorio Veneto was undamaged but Littorio — by now renamed Italia — was hit and damaged and her sister Roma was sunk in the attack . 
 Vittorio Veneto remained in Malta until 14 September , when she and Italia were moved to Alexandria , Egypt and then to the Great Bitter Lake in the Suez Canal on 17 October . The two battleships remained there until 6 October 1946 , when they were permitted to return to Italy . Vittorio Veneto went to Augusta , Sicily before moving to La Spezia on 14 October . In the Treaty of Peace with Italy , signed on 10 February 1947 , Vittorio Veneto was allocated as a war prize to Britain . She was paid off on 3 January 1948 , stricken from the naval register on 1 February , and subsequently broken up for scrap . Vittorio Veneto had been the most active Italian battleship of the war , having participated in eleven offensive operations . Twelve 90 mm anti @-@ aircraft guns taken from Vittorio Veneto were reused by the Yugoslav People 's Army ( JNA ) as armament of its Žirje Island coastal artillery battery . The battery surrendered without resistance to the Croatian National Guard on 14 September 1991 , during the Croatian War of Independence , and played a pivotal role in 16 – 22 September Battle of Šibenik , helping defend the city of Šibenik against the JNA .

 The Town That Dreaded Sundown is a 1976 American slasher film by producer and director Charles B. Pierce who also co @-@ stars as a bumbling police officer named A.C. Benson , also known as " Sparkplug " . Pierce 's fifth film is narrated by Vern <unk> who had previously narrated Pierce 's 1972 film The Legend of Boggy Creek . Ben Johnson stars as Captain J.D. Morales , the fictionalized version of real @-@ life Texas Ranger Captain M. T. " Lone Wolf " <unk> . Dawn Wells ( Mary Ann of Gilligan 's Island ) appears as one of the victims . Cindy Butler ( Pierce 's girlfriend at the time ) plays Peggy Loomis , the trombone victim . The Phantom is played by Bud Davis , who later worked as stunt coordinator on films such as Forrest Gump , Cast Away , and Inglourious Basterds . The film was mostly shot around Texarkana , and a number of locals were cast as extras . The world premiere was held in Texarkana on December 17 , 1976 , before its regular run in theaters on December 24 . The film is an early example of a slasher film , having been released two years before Halloween ( 1978 ) , and just two years after Black Christmas ( 1974 ) , a film considered as one of the earliest in the genre . 
 The film is somewhat loosely based on the actual crimes attributed to an unidentified serial killer known as the Phantom Killer ; it claims that " the incredible story you are about to see is true , where it happened and how it happened ; only the names have been changed . " The actual Phantom attacked eight people between February 22 , 1946 and May 3 , 1946 in or near the town of Texarkana , Texas , which is on the border of Texas and Arkansas . Most of the murders occurred in rural areas just outside Texarkana , in Bowie County , Texas , while the film has them occurring in Arkansas . However , the general outline of the murders largely follows the reality , with mostly minor artistic license taken . As in the film , the real killer was never identified nor apprehended . 
 The film is loose enough with the facts that one family member of a victim filed a lawsuit in 1978 , over its depiction of his sister . The fabricated facts in the film have also caused rumors and folklore to spread for generations around Texarkana . The film 's tagline claims that the man who killed five people " still lurks the streets of Texarkana , Ark . " , causing officials of that neighboring city to threaten Pierce over the ads in 1977 ; however , it remained on the posters . A meta @-@ sequel with the same name was released on October 16 , 2014 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Before the " Phantom @-@ attacks " , which occurred about eight months after World War II , Texarkana was pleasant and citizens were preparing for a good future . On the night of Sunday , March 3 , 1946 , Sammy Fuller and Linda Mae Jenkins park on a lovers ' lane . Soon , the hood of the car opens and closes and a man with a bag over his head with holes cut out for his eyes is seen holding wires he had yanked from the engine . While Sammy tries starting the car , the man breaks his window and pulls him out , cutting him on the broken glass . The man then gets inside the car with Linda . 
 The next morning , Linda is found on the side of the road barely alive . While at the crime scene , Deputy Norman Ramsey reports that both victims are still alive . He leaves a message for Sheriff Barker to meet him at Michael @-@ Meagher Hospital . At the hospital , a doctor tells Sheriff Barker that Linda was not raped but that her back , stomach , and breasts were " heavily bitten ; literally chewed . " At the police station , Barker suggests to Police Chief Sullivan to warn teens and college students from parking on lonely roads . 
 On March 24 , while investigating a lovers ' lane in heavy rain , Ramsey hears gunshots and finds Howard W. Turner dead in a ditch and the corpse of his girlfriend , Emma Lou Cook , tied to a tree . Ramsey spots the hooded man escaping in a car . Panicked , the town sells out of guns and other home safety equipment . Sheriff Barker calls in help and tells Ramsey they are getting the most famous criminal investigator in the country , the " Lone Wolf " of the Texas Rangers , Captain J.D. Morales . After arriving , Morales explains he 'll be in charge of the investigation and calls the unidentified attacker a Phantom . Ramsey is assigned to assist Morales , and Patrolman A.C. Benson " Sparkplug " is to be his driver . 
 At the barber shop , Ramsey explains to Morales his theory that the Phantom attacks every 21 days . The next attack falls on the day of a high school prom , and decoys are set up on the edges of town . After the dance , on April 14 , trombone player Peggy Loomis leaves with her boyfriend Roy Allen . Despite her worries , they go to Spring Lake Park in the middle of town . When they leave , the Phantom jumps on the driver 's door and pulls Roy out of the car , causing Peggy to wreck . She flees as the Phantom beats Roy , but he catches her and ties her hands around a tree . Roy awakens but is shot to death while attempting to escape . The Phantom attaches a pocket knife to Peggy 's trombone and kills her while " playing " the instrument . 
 Morales and other officers meet with psychiatrist Dr. Kress at a restaurant where he explains that the Phantom is a highly intelligent sadist with a strong sex drive , between the ages of 35 and 40 . As Kress expresses his doubts about their chances of capturing the Phantom , the Phantom 's shoes are shown , revealing that he had heard the entire conversation . At the station , a man named Johnson says that he was robbed and forced to drive a man to Lufkin at gunpoint . While on the road , Ramsey receives a report about an armed suspect , and a brief chase ensues . The suspect , Eddie <unk> , at first denies everything , then confesses to being the Phantom , but Morales is unconvinced . Johnson identifies him as his robber . 
 On May 3 , Helen Reed is seen by the Phantom leaving a grocery store . At home that night , Helen asks her husband Floyd , who is sitting in front of a window in his armchair , if he hears somebody walking outside . After he replies that he does not , the Phantom shoots him through their window . Helen inspects and sees Floyd dying . As she uses the telephone to call police , the Phantom breaks through the screen door and shoots her twice in the face . Despite her wounds , she drags herself out of the house and into a cornfield while the Phantom inspects Floyd 's body . The Phantom stalks her with a pickaxe , but leaves when she gets help at a nearby house . News of this attack causes the town to panic , and people begin boarding up their windows . 
 Later , Morales and Ramsey receive a report about a stolen car that matches the one from the Turner and Cook murders . While investigating a sand pit , they encounter the Phantom . Morales shoots at him but misses , causing him to run into the woods . The Phantom escapes by jumping past a moving train , but is shot in the leg . While waiting for the train to pass , the Phantom escapes . They continue their search but never find him . Years later , the film " The Town That Dreaded Sundown " premieres in Texarkana and the shoes of the Phantom are seen standing in line .

 Principal photography began on Monday , June 21 , in the very hot summer of 1976 for about four weeks . Locations included Scott , Arkansas , Shreveport , Louisiana , Garland City , Arkansas and Texarkana , Texas . The last scene filmed was the first attack , which was shot in front of Pierce 's home in Shreveport . About 19 Texarkana locals starred in the film along with several extras . 
 Pierce called Dawn Wells on July 8 , 1976 , to star in his film . She arrived by plane in Texarkana before noon the next day . She stayed in Texarkana for six days but completed her scenes in the first two . While filming the cornfield scene , Wells was almost attacked by a bulldog , but the crew scared it away by shooting at it . Wells wanted to talk to the real @-@ life survivor of her role , Katie Starks , but Katie refused . The Town That Dreaded Sundown was Wells ' fourth film and her second time working with Pierce . During her stay , she did not read the script ; she relied on the director instead . She said that was the way she wanted it . Wells explained , " Acting @-@ wise , it 's an extremely emotional role . I didn 't want to pattern my interpretation after anything . I wanted to go on my own feelings . " Being shot was a new experience for the actress . " They planted a charge in the receiver , so I was standing there holding the phone , shaking , expecting the receiver to blow up in my face . " 
 Andrew Prine , who played Norman Ramsey , wrote the last fifth of the film because it had no ending . Both he and Ben Johnson were hungover while filming the train scene after partying the night before . During the rain scene with Ramsey , a snake made its way on the set . Crew members were yelling at Andrew that there was a moccasin , but Prine wanted to finish his scene without re @-@ shooting , so the crew killed the snake afterwards . The last shot of the film where the killer is seen standing in line at the movie theater was Pierce 's wife 's idea .

 The film is one of several so @-@ called " drive @-@ in " films that were presented as true stories ( à la 1972 's The Legend of Boggy Creek ; 1973 's Walking Tall ; 1974 's The Texas Chain Saw Massacre ; 1975 's Macon County Line and 1976 's Jackson County Jail ) when most , if not all , of what was portrayed on screen was outright fiction .

 The film 's poster art was painted with acrylic by a graphic illustrator named Ralph McQuarrie , then an unknown . McQuarrie had painted the poster for Peirce 's The Legend of Boggy Creek , then later for his films Bootleggers ( 1974 ) , Winterhawk ( 1975 ) , and Winds of Autumn ( 1976 ) . McQuarrie became recognized for his talent and went on to paint posters for Creature from Black Lake ( 1976 ) , Battlestar Galactica ( 1978 ) , Close Encounters of the Third Kind ( 1977 ) , Back to the Future ( 1985 ) and the original Star Wars trilogy . His concept art was used to help convince 20th Century Fox to fund Star Wars . The advertising department placed the controversial phrase , " In 1946 this man killed five people ... today he still lurks the streets of Texarkana , Ark . " on the poster . After Texarkana city officials threatened to sue , Pierce tried having the statement removed . The last part of the phrase was censored or removed in advertisements , but it remained on several posters . 
 The film was released theatrically in the United States by American International Pictures on December 24 , 1976 , and internationally in Sweden ( 1977 ) , West Germany ( 1978 ) , and the Philippines ( 1979 ) . It was played at drive @-@ ins until the end of 1977 and made its television debut by June 1978 . It was released on VHS in 1983 by Warner Home Video who then re @-@ released it in 1988 . Good Times Video also released it on VHS on May 15 , 2001 . The Turner Classic Movies ( TCM ) cable channel occasionally airs widescreen versions of this film , with the most recent showing scheduled for March 14th 2015 . The film finally had a digital release on May 21 , 2013 when Shout ! Factory released it on a Blu @-@ ray / DVD Combo Pack including Pierce 's 1979 film The Evictors .

 Larry Fisher , a film critic for the Delta Democrat @-@ Times , gave the film a three star rating out of five . He said Ben Johnson gave a superb performance as Captain J.D. Morales , and that " Although the picture lacks a strong ending , Pierce does one of the most credible jobs of engineering the tense , horrifying murder scenes . " Mark Melson , Shreveport Times Amusement editor , claimed that it " may prove interesting to some viewers for one reason or another " but was " ultimately unsatisfying . " 
 William Whitaker of the Abilene Reporter @-@ News gave the film a negative review , stating , " where I was expecting a dramatic retelling of the mysterious case concerning the phantom killer and his bizarre murders , I was greeted with an extremely uneven picture , collapsing into the most sickening , blood @-@ weltering scenes one minute and then lapsing into some incredibly bad comedy relief the next . " He continued , " Such vivid contrasts in the film 's approach to its subject lead to its downfall . Any effect the disgustingly boring and extremely brutal murder scenes have go to waste seconds later when director Charles B. Pierce leads the picture into some of the type of poor comedy relief that one is used to seeing in budget pictures of the ' 60s . As a result , the film is unable to conjure up any mood or suspense . " He concludes with , " All in all , the picture is an unpleasant little film and Pierce , after going overboard on the blood and gore scenes , never seems to be able to decide as to how serious the picture should be , " and that " both mature and immature minds should avoid the film . " A reporter in El Paso , Texas gave it a mixed review , writing that " this mixture of humor with fact saved ' The Town ... ' as it wakes the audience when things begin to lag . " He goes on to write , " All things considered , the movie is entertaining and would appeal to those who savor unsolved murder mysteries . "

 Scott Weinberg from <unk> gave it a positive review by claiming that it is , " Arguably the most accomplished feature from the late Charles B. Pierce , " and " while the movie offers a slightly stodgy ' voice @-@ over ' narration and some moments that seem plucked straight out of ' 1970s police procedural 101 ' , including a few painful moments of cop @-@ related comic relief , it also delivers some legitimately effective atmosphere , several cool character actors doing fine work , and a handful of sincerely creepy moments . " 
 Bloody Disgusting gave the film five " skulls " in a review by Patrick Cooper , who wrote that it is " a hugely entertaining atmospheric thriller , " and that " the only parts that fumble a bit are the regrettable comedic moments ... these well @-@ intentioned bits sharply interrupt the serious ambiance of the film , but at least they 're few and spaced far enough apart that they don 't ruin the whole thing . " Film review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes reported an approval rating of 50 % , based on 8 reviews , with a rating average of 5 @.@ 3 / 10 . 
 = = Historical accuracy = = 
 At the beginning of the film , it states that the first attack occurred on Sunday , March 3rd . In real life , the attack happened on Friday , February 22nd . Jimmy Hollis ( portrayed as " Sammy Fuller " ) was not pulled out of the window . The girl , Mary Jeanne Larey ( portrayed as " Linda Mae Jenkins " ) was told to run . She was then chased down and sexually assaulted with the attacker 's gun . She soon escaped and received help at a house . In the film , the doctor claimed that she was bitten and chewed , but Mary Larey only had a cut on her head from being beaten . 
 The next attack in the film claims that it happened on Saturday , March 24th ; in 1946 , March 24th was on a Sunday . In the film , " Howard Turner " and his girlfriend , " Emma Lou Cook " , were found dead outside of the vehicle . Emma Cook was shown tied to a tree with bite marks . In real life , both victims were found inside of the vehicle shot to death . The character " Deputy Ramsey " was patrolling the area and found the bodies . Afterwards , he sees the Phantom getting into a car and leaving . On the real morning of March 24th , a passing motorist spotted a car and found the bodies of Richard Griffin and Polly Ann Moore inside before calling the authorities . By the time the officers were on the scene , the killer was long gone . 
 The film states that locals soon started buying guns and locks , but this did not happen until two months later in May . The characters in the film then brought in Captain J.D. Morales of the Texas Rangers . Truthfully , " Lone Wolf " did not come to Texarkana until after the second double @-@ murder near Spring Lake Park . The film has Morales naming the killer a phantom , but the naming of the killer did not come until after the murders in April , and by the executive editor of the Texarkana Gazette . 
 The film then shows a high school prom with the character " Peggy Loomis " playing a trombone . The officers were setting up decoys in an attempt to capture the Phantom . Betty Jo Booker , who played saxophone ( not a trombone ) was playing at a Veterans of Foreign Wars ( VFW ) social event ( not a prom ) , and officers did not set up decoys until after her and her friend Paul Martin 's murder . In the film , " Peggy " and " Roy " are a couple , but Booker and Martin were only friends in real life . She and Martin were shot to death , and her saxophone was missing for six months . In the film , " Deputy Ramsey " collects the victim 's instrument as evidence . 
 In the film , " Helen Reed " sees the attacker before being shot . However , Katie Starks was shot through the same window as her husband and did not see her attacker until he tried crawling through the kitchen window . Mrs. Starks ran out of the house but was not chased . At the end of the film , the officers chase The Phantom and shoot him in the leg , but the real Phantom was never chased or shot at all . 
 = = Controversies = = 
 In February 1977 , Texarkana city officials voted to file a lawsuit against the ad campaign . When city officials visited Washington , D.C. , they were <unk> about the film 's tagline which states : " In 1946 this man killed five people ... today he still lurks the streets of Texarkana , Ark . " Mayor Harvey Nelson explained : " The ad is too much ; that 's just not true . There 's objection that this whole thing will be spreading fear in the community . There are relatives of the victims still living here , and this is very unpleasant to them . " Pierce worked with American International Pictures to remove the " still lurking " statement , but it remained on the posters . 
 In 1978 , Mark Melton Moore , the brother of real @-@ life victim Polly Ann Moore , took Pierce to court for $ 1 @.@ 3 million for invading his privacy . He claimed his sister , who was portrayed as " Emma Lou Cook " in the film , was depicted " as a high school dropout and a woman with loose and low morals ; when in fact none of such was true . " In real life , Polly Ann Moore graduated high school at the age of 16 . The court denied his claim in 1979 . Mr. Moore filed again in 1980 to the Texas Supreme Court . The Sixth Court of Civil Appeals in Texarkana agreed again that the film 's producers did not invade his privacy and that he was not entitled to any money . 
 On March 15 , 1978 , Gerald <unk> , a teenager , shot and killed his high school friend James <unk> . In court , <unk> stated that he thought of his plan to be an " outlaw " like Jesse James ( the infamous legendary outlaw of the Wild West ) while watching The Town That Dreaded Sundown .

 = 1968 Liberty Bowl = 
 The 1968 Liberty Bowl was a post @-@ season American college football bowl game between the Virginia Tech Hokies and the Ole Miss Rebels from the University of Mississippi at Memphis Memorial Stadium in Memphis , Tennessee on December 14 , 1968 . The game was the final contest of the 1968 college football season for both teams , and ended in a 34 @-@ 17 victory for Mississippi . 
 Two years after a previous trip to the Liberty Bowl , Virginia Tech was again asked to travel to Memphis to play in a post @-@ season bowl game . This time , the opponent was Mississippi , which had amassed a 6 – 3 – 1 record during the regular season . The Hokies came into the game with a 7 – 3 record that included a loss to Tech 's previous Liberty Bowl opponent , Miami . 
 The 1968 Liberty Bowl kicked off on December 14 , 1968 . As in the Hokies ' previous appearance in the Liberty Bowl , Virginia Tech got off to a fast start . On the game 's second play , Tech ran 58 yards for a touchdown , courtesy of a trick play . After Mississippi fumbled , Tech recovered and scored another quick touchdown . At the end of the first quarter , Tech added a field goal to the two touchdowns it had already earned , making the score 17 – 0 at the end of one quarter . From that point onward , however , almost nothing would go in Virginia Tech 's favor . Tech attempted an onside kick following the field goal , but were unable to successfully recover the ball . With good field position following the kick , Mississippi quarterback Archie Manning orchestrated a 49 @-@ yard drive for the Rebels ' first points of the game . 
 Mississippi scored another touchdown before halftime , and the Hokies clung to a 17 – 14 lead at the beginning of the second half . That three @-@ point lead quickly evaporated , however , as 21 seconds into the third quarter , Mississippi 's Steve Hindman ran for 79 yards and a touchdown to give Mississippi a 21 – 17 lead . Ole Miss added 13 more points before the game ended and earned the victory , 34 – 17 .

 The Virginia Tech Hokies , led by head coach Jerry <unk> , amassed a 7 – 3 record during the regular season prior to the Liberty Bowl . The Hokies came into the 1968 season with high expectations . From 1963 to 1967 , Virginia Tech was the 12th winningest major college football program , recording 36 wins , 13 losses , and one tie — putting the Hokies just behind Notre Dame in winning percentage . During the regular season , linebacker Mike Widger emerged as a major threat on defense for Tech . In the Hokies ' win over No. 18 Florida State in 1968 , Widger intercepted two passes . Shortly after Liberty Bowl committee chairman Bud Dudley selected the Hokies to play in the Liberty Bowl , Widger was named a first @-@ team Associated Press All @-@ American , marking him as one of the best players at his position in the country . 
 = = = Mississippi = = = 
 The Ole Miss Rebels , led by head coach John Vaught , earned a regular @-@ season record of 6 – 3 – 1 prior to the Liberty Bowl . Vaught remains the all @-@ time leader in wins at Ole Miss , and at the time of Mississippi 's selection for the 1968 Liberty Bowl , he had already led the Rebels to three national championships and six Southeastern Conference championships , the most recent of each coming in 1962 . On the field , Ole Miss featured star quarterback Archie Manning , who despite being just a sophomore , was already making a name for himself and would later go on to set records for passing yardage and passing touchdowns for Ole Miss , en route to becoming one of the greatest quarterbacks in Mississippi history . 
 = = Game summary = = 
 The 1968 Liberty bowl kicked off on a cold and blustery day in front of 46 @,@ 206 fans at Memphis Memorial Stadium in Memphis , Tennessee on December 14 , 1968 . The record crowd ( it was the largest in the 10 @-@ year history of the bowl to that point ) consumed 20 @,@ 000 hot dogs — so many that the stadium ran out by the third quarter . 
 In the first quarter of the game , it appeared that Virginia Tech would run away with an overwhelming victory . Tech received the ball to begin the game , and on the game 's second play , Virginia Tech 's Ken Edwards ran 58 yards on a trick play for the game 's first touchdown . Mississippi fumbled the ball on its first offensive play and Virginia Tech recovered the turnover . Three plays later , Tech scored another touchdown on a seven @-@ yard run by Terry Smoot . After stopping the Rebels with their defense , Tech appeared to have another chance to score when the Hokies ' Ron Davidson returned an Ole Miss punt to the Rebels ' 42 @-@ yard line . Despite the excellent field position , Tech was unable to score after Hokie quarterback Al Kinkaid was sacked for a 19 @-@ yard loss . Despite the setback , Tech was able to keep Ole Miss from scoring in the first quarter and tacked on a 29 @-@ yard field goal by kicker Jack <unk> before time came to an end in the quarter . At the end of the quarter , Tech led 17 – 0 . 
 In the second quarter , Mississippi came storming back . Following the field goal , Tech head coach Jerry Claiborne ordered an onside kick in an effort to gain another chance on offense and potentially build an insurmountable lead . <unk> kicks , unlike an ordinary free kick , can be recovered by the kicking team — but only after the ball has traveled 10 yards . If the kicking team touches the ball before it has traveled 10 yards , the receiving team takes possession at the place the ball was touched . Unfortunately for Virginia Tech , <unk> 's onside kick — though it surprised Ole Miss — did not travel the requisite 10 yards . Mississippi took over at the Virginia Tech 49 @-@ yard line , and many of the Ole Miss players were angered by what they considered to be an insult . 
 Mississippi quarterback Archie Manning used the good field position and his inspired offense proficiently following the kick , driving the Rebels down the field and connecting with Hank Shows on a 21 @-@ yard touchdown pass for Mississippi 's first points just 30 seconds into the second quarter . By halftime , Manning had connected on another touchdown pass , this one a 23 @-@ yard strike to Leon Felts . Tech still held a 17 – 14 lead , but Mississippi had the momentum and would receive the ball to begin the second half . 
 Ole Miss wasted no time in scoring , as Steve Hindman turned the first play of the second half into a 79 @-@ yard for a touchdown . The Rebels now held a 21 – 17 lead , and Virginia Tech never threatened afterward . Ole Miss defender Bob Bailey intercepted a Virginia Tech pass at the beginning of the fourth quarter and returned it 70 yards for another Mississippi touchdown . The Rebels also added a pair of field goals to their score , and rolled to a 34 – 17 victory over Virginia Tech . 
 = = Statistical summary = = 
 Mississippi 's Steve Hindman was named the game 's most valuable player after he rushed the ball for 121 yards and a touchdown in addition to catching three passes for 32 yards . Ole Miss quarterback Archie Manning finished the game with 141 passing yards and two touchdowns . Virginia Tech was led on offense by Ken Edwards , who finished with 119 rushing yards and a touchdown , and Terry Smoot , who finished with 91 rushing yards and a touchdown . Tech turned the ball over five times , committing three fumbles and throwing two interceptions to the Mississippi defense . Despite Tech 's relative offensive success on the ground , the Hokies were completely inept through the air , completing just one pass for two net passing yards . Both marks remain Liberty Bowl records for the fewest passes and fewest passing yards gained by a team . 
 Although the Hokies had success on defense during the first quarter , Mississippi dominated the Hokies defensively for the rest of the game . Such was the defensive dominance of Mississippi in the last three quarters of the game that after Tech 's field goal in the first quarter , the Hokies had 11 offensive possessions and crossed into Ole Miss territory just once . 
 In addition to Steve Hindman 's selection as the game 's MVP , Mississippi had two other players recognized for their achievements in the game : Robert Bailey was named the game 's most outstanding defensive back and offensive tackle Worthy McClure was named the game 's most outstanding offensive lineman . 
 = Run Baby Run ( Garbage song ) = 
 " Run Baby Run " was a single released from Garbage 's fourth album Bleed Like Me in the summer of 2005 in Europe and Australia . It was released as joint @-@ second single from the album – around the same time the United Kingdom received a parallel release for " Sex Is Not The Enemy " and " Bleed Like Me " was released in the U.S. 
 Following on from the unexpectedly high chart positions for both the previous single " Why Do You Love Me " and the parent album Bleed Like Me , " Run Baby Run " failed to replicate their success . " Run Baby Run " was to be the third single release from Bleed Like Me in the United Kingdom , scheduled to be released at the same time as the band 's UK tour .

Garbage didn 't finish the song until the very end of the album sessions . 
 Shirley Manson later recalled , " " Run Baby Run " is about trying to engineer your own peace of mind and being unafraid to make changes in your life in order to try and facilitate that . [ It 's ] about escape and engineering your own path in life . We ’ re all too guilty of thinking that peace , love and healthiness are things that we ’ re all just given " . The singer added that fairy tales gave " this idea that somebody 's gonna come along and fix your life " , but eventually " I sort of came to the realization that actually nobody 's gonna fix your life for you , you have to do it yourself . And it 's about just making an effort to make your life good . If it sucks , do something about it . " Erikson added , " Being expected to go through life to behave a certain way ; I think " Run Baby Run " is a plea to run from that . Run with your life , take it wherever it takes you . It 's about not conforming . " 
 On 25 May , Garbage confirmed a list of fourteen songs being worked on for the record , including " Run " , and on 14 December confirmed that the song , now with final title of " Run Baby Run " , would be included on the finished album Bleed Like Me .

 " Run Baby Run " was generally very well received by contemporary pop music critics , a number of whom , including NME , commented on the track as part of Bleed Like Me 's strong opening half .

" The New York Daily News also picked up on the New Order sound , commenting that the band had given the bass guitar " the best hook " .

 Rolling Stone felt that song 's " tender , dreamy verses " brought to mind " Just Like Heaven " by The Cure .

 = 1957 Pacific hurricane season = 
 The 1957 Pacific hurricane season was a moderately active year in which 13 tropical cyclones formed . The hurricane season ran through the summer and fall months which conventionally delimit the period during which most tropical cyclones form in the northeastern Pacific Ocean . The first tropical cyclone developed on July 15 . The final storm dissipated on December 6 , becoming one of the few Pacific storms to exist outside of the seasonal dates . Of the season 's 13 storms , five of these formed or crossed into the central Pacific . 
 During the season , five storms impacted land . Hurricane Twelve was the deadliest , leaving eight casualties in Mazatlán and the costliest was Hurricane Nina , causing an estimated $ 100 @,@ 000 in losses . In addition to the damage , four people were killed by Nina in Hawaii . Hurricane Six killed seven people and Hurricane Ten killed two in Mexico .

 The first hurricane of the season was identified by the National Weather Bureau in San Francisco , California on July 15 . The previous day , the S.S. <unk> Park recorded sustained winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) when it was situated roughly 75 mi ( 120 km ) south of Manzanillo , Mexico . Although listed as a Category 1 hurricane for its entire known existence by the hurricane database , the storm was not confirmed to have attained hurricane intensity until July 21 . The storm took a steady westward track during the early portion of its existence in response to a strong ridge located north of Hawaii . On July 18 , the National Weather Bureau discontinued advisories on the storm as no information on it was being received . 
 On July 21 , a vessel named Cape Horn relayed information regarding the storm to the National Weather Bureau , leading to them re @-@ issuing advisories on the storm , upgrading it to a hurricane . The following day , a reconnaissance mission from Oahu , Hawaii located the storm 's 40 mi ( 65 km ) wide eye and recorded sustained winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) and gusts up to 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) . Shortly after , the storm likely attained its peak intensity as a high @-@ end Category 1 hurricane , with winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) . Early on July 23 , warning responsibility of the storm was given to the National Weather Bureau in Honolulu , Hawaii . 
 Upon transferring responsibility , the hurricane was given the name Kanoa , the Hawaiian name meaning " the free one " . As the storm approached Hawaii , it began to weaken as convection filled the eye . The storm 's track mirrored that of the shipping lane between the Panama Canal and Hawaii , leading to several ships being affected . Colder air also began to enter the circulation , leading to further weakening . By the time the system reached Hawaii , it was no more than an area of disturbed weather . The remnants of Kanoa persisted until July 26 , at which time they dissipated over the Hawaiian Islands . The remnants of the storm brought beneficial rainfall to most of Hawaii , with heavy rains being reported in parts of the Big Island . 
 = = = Hurricane Two = = = 
 Roughly two weeks after Kanoa dissipated , the season 's second hurricane was identified over the open waters of the eastern Pacific on August 6 . This storm traveled in a similar fashion to Kanoa in response to a high pressure system over the northern Pacific . By August 9 , the system turned northwest and weakened . Cold , dry air began to enter the storm as it accelerated over cooler waters . Several reconnaissance missions were flown into the storm due to rapid changes in the storm 's wind field and structure . Late on August 10 , the system intensified into a Category 1 hurricane and its forward motion slowed as it turned more westward . 
 Although at an unusual latitude , the storm maintained this intensity for over a day before weakening to a tropical storm . During the afternoon of August 13 , the small system re @-@ intensified into a hurricane . Reconnaissance reported that gale @-@ force winds extended no more than 100 mi ( 155 km ) from the storm 's eye . Shortly thereafter , the system further intensified into a Category 2 hurricane , attaining maximum winds of 105 mph ( 160 km / h ) . Weather maps at the time depicted the storm as having a minimum pressure of 987 mbar ( hPa ) . By August 14 , the storm began to weaken once more , gradually becoming a tropical storm on August 15 . After <unk> northward , the cyclone became extratropical at a high latitude of 39 @.@ 8 ° N.

 As Hurricane Two intensified over open waters , the season 's third storm was identified on August 9 . Initially tracking westward , the hurricane turned sharply north , maintaining an intensity of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) during its known existence .

On August 14 , the hurricane turned north once more ; however , it lost its identity the following day off the coast of Baja California .

 Hurricane Della was first identified on September 1 southeast of Hawaii as a tropical depression . The depression quickly intensified into a tropical storm as it traveled northwest ; however , operational advisories were not issued until September 3 . By that time , a ship reported they had encountered a storm and recorded winds of 100 mph ( 155 km / h ) . Radar images also depicted an eye had developed within the storm . After becoming a hurricane , Della began a gradual turn towards the southwest . During the day on September 4 , the storm passed roughly 10 mi ( 15 km ) south of the French Frigate Shoals , bringing strong winds gusting up to 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) . During the storm 's passage , a pressure of 980 mbar ( hPa ) was recorded , the lowest in relation to the storm . By September 9 , Della began to turn westward as it approached the International Date Line with winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) . 
 During the day , the storm crossed 180 ° , entering the western Pacific basin and being re @-@ designated as a typhoon . The storm tracked steadily northwestward , attaining a peak intensity of 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) , a high @-@ end Category 3 storm , before turning back towards the east . The storm gradually weakened , transitioning into an extratropical cyclone on September 17 and again crossing the International Date Line . The system dissipated shortly thereafter over open waters . Throughout its existence , Hurricane / Typhoon Della traveled roughly 5 @,@ 000 mi ( 8 @,@ 000 km ) , the longest known track of any Pacific hurricane at the time .

 On September 17 , a new hurricane was identified just off the southern coast of Mexico with winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) . Moving northwestward , the storm eventually made landfall near Acapulco , Mexico at this intensity . Shortly after moving over land , the storm lost its identity . 
 High winds and heavy rains from the storm caused moderate damage to structures and vessels throughout Acapulco , Mexico . Several roads were washed out or flooded by the storm . Seven people were killed throughout the region by the storm , including one U.S. citizen who was electrocuted by a downed power line .

 Several days after Hurricane Six lost its identity over Mexico , a new tropical storm formed near the southern edge of the Gulf of California on September 20 . Some forecasters stated that the system may have been the remnants of the preceding storm which regenerated . However , the Hurricane Database did not confirm this . The system tracked nearly due north , attaining maximum winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) , nearing the coastline of Mexico several times . However , the storm did not make landfall during its existence . On September 22 , it turned westward before dissipating just off the coast of Baja California Sur .

Initially tracking westward , the system turned northwest and later northeast by October 3 . After a brief acceleration on October 4 , the hurricane slowed as it neared the coastline of Baja California . Early on October 5 , the storm crossed the Peninsula as a Category 1 hurricane before entering the Gulf of California . The hurricane made another landfall near Navojoa , Mexico later that day . Rapid weakening took place as the storm moved over the high terrain over northern Mexico . Early on October 6 , the system transitioned into an extratropical cyclone over New Mexico before dissipating several hours later . 
 At least two people were killed after their home collapsed on them a result of the storm in Mexico . Severe cotton crop damage was reported in the Mexican states of Sonora and Baja California Sur and bridges were washed away by flood waters .

 = = = Hurricane Twelve = = = 
 The strongest storm of the season , Hurricane Twelve , was first identified as a tropical depression several hundred miles southwest of Sonora , Mexico on October 20 . Tracking northeastward , the system gradually intensified into a tropical storm . Late on October 21 , the storm underwent a brief period of explosive intensification , strengthening from a 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) tropical storm to a 140 mph ( 220 km / h ) Category 4 hurricane in roughly six hours . The hurricane maintained this intensity for a further six hours before making landfall near Mazatlán . Rapid weakening took place as the hurricane moved inland , with the system dissipating during the afternoon of October 22 . 
 Throughout the affected region , eight people were killed by the storm . Extensive property damage was reported in the region , including the complete collapse of the local baseball stadium . Power lines and telegraph wires were downed throughout the region and high winds reportedly tossed vehicles into buildings . Many shrimp trawlers sank in the storm , leaving substantial losses in Mexico 's shrimping industry . 
 = = = Hurricane Nina = = = 
 The last storm of the 1957 season , Hurricane Nina , was an unusually late @-@ forming system . It was first identified on November 29 as a tropical storm to the southwest of Hawaii . Steadily tracking north @-@ northeast , the storm intensified into a Category 1 hurricane , by which time it was given the name Nina . As it approached Hawaii , the National Weather Bureau issued warnings for the storm , advising residents to take precaution and possibly evacuate . However , the storm turned westward before moving over the Hawaiian Islands with winds of 85 mph ( 140 km / h ) . Gradual weakening took place as the storm continued to move over open waters . Nina eventually dissipated after turning south on December 6 . 
 Waves up to 35 ft ( 11 m ) damaged up to 50 homes across Hawaii and roughly 12 of them being destroyed on Kauai alone . One person was killed on land after being electrocuted by a downed power line . Offshore , a sampan called the Setsu Maru sent a distress call reporting that the boat was sinking 10 miles east of Niihau . All three people aboard the boat were reported dead as a result . In all , damage from the hurricane was estimated at $ 100 @,@ 000 . 
 = = Storm names = = 
 During 1957 , hurricanes that formed east of 140 ° W were not given names by the local warning center . Those that either crossed or formed west of that point were named by the National Weather Bureau in Honolulu , Hawaii . These names were taken from the names used for Pacific typhoons . Three names were used in 1957 , they were Kanoa , Della and Nina . Due to the lack of major damage from these storms , their names were not retired . However , once the Central Pacific adopted its own naming scheme , these names were no longer used .

 = Creek whaler = 
 The creek whaler ( Carcharhinus fitzroyensis ) is a common species of requiem shark , and part of the family Carcharhinidae , endemic to northern Australia . It frequents shallow waters close to shore , including estuaries . This small , stocky shark usually grows to 1 @.@ 0 – 1 @.@ 3 m ( 3 @.@ 3 – 4 @.@ 3 ft ) long and is brownish in color without conspicuous fin markings . It can be identified by its long snout , large , triangular pectoral fins , and large , anteriorly positioned first dorsal fin . 
 The diet of the creek whaler consists mainly of small teleost fishes and crustaceans . It is viviparous , with the unborn young being sustained through a placental connection . The defined mating season lasts from May to July . Females give birth to one to seven pups annually , following a gestation period of seven to 9 months . A small number of creek whalers are caught incidentally in inshore gillnets and used for food , but the effect of fishing on its population seems to be inconsequential . As a result , the IUCN has listed this species under Least Concern . 
 = = Taxonomy and phylogeny = = 
 The creek whaler was described by Australian ichthyologist Gilbert Percy Whitley in a 1943 volume of Proceedings of the Linnean Society of New South Wales . He assigned the new species to the subgenus <unk> of the genus Galeolamna , and gave it the specific epithet fitzroyensis because the type specimen , a 1 @.@ 2 @-@ m @-@ long female , was collected from Connor 's Creek in the Fitzroy River estuary . Subsequent authors have synonymized Galeolamna with Carcharhinus . 
 The evolutionary relationships of the creek whaler have yet to be fully resolved . In comparative morphological studies published by Jack Garrick in 1982 and Leonard Compagno in 1988 , it was tentatively placed in a grouping defined by the whitecheek shark ( C. dussumieri ) and the blackspot shark ( C. sealei ) . Shane Lavery , in a 1992 study based on allozymes , reported that this species was close to the nervous shark ( C. cautus ) and the blacktip reef shark ( C. melanopterus ) . Ximena Vélez @-@ Zuazoa and Ingi Agnarsson , in a 2011 study based on nuclear and mitochondrial genes , found it to be the basal member of a clade also containing the graceful shark ( C. amblyrhynchoides ) , the blacktip shark ( C. limbatus ) , and the Australian blacktip shark ( C. tilstoni ) . 
 = = Description = = 
 The body of the creek whaler is spindle @-@ shaped and rather stocky . The long snout has a narrowly parabolic shape and large nostrils preceded by small , nipple @-@ shaped flaps of skin . The eyes are circular and of medium size , and are equipped with nictitating membranes . The arched mouth has very short furrows at the corners . There are 30 upper and 28 – 30 lower tooth rows . The upper teeth are long and triangular with strongly serrated edges , and become increasing angled towards the sides of the jaw . The lower teeth are slender and upright with finely serrated edges . The five pairs of gill slits are short . 
 The pectoral fins are distinctively large and triangular , with rounded to pointed tips . The large first dorsal fin originates over the rear of the pectoral fin bases . The second dorsal fin is relatively tall and long , and originates over or slightly behind the anal fin origin . There is no ridge between the dorsal fins . The anal fin is larger than the second dorsal fin . There is a crescent @-@ shaped notch on the caudal peduncle just before the origin of the upper caudal fin lobe . The asymmetrical caudal fin has a well @-@ developed lower lobe and a longer upper lobe with a ventral notch near the tip . The skin is densely covered by overlapping dermal denticles , each bearing three to five horizontal ridges leading to marginal teeth . This species is bronze to brownish gray above and pale below , and lacks an obvious lighter band on the flanks . Rarely , individuals may be light bluish gray above . It may reach 1 @.@ 5 m ( 4 @.@ 9 ft ) in length , though 1 @.@ 0 – 1 @.@ 3 m ( 3 @.@ 3 – 4 @.@ 3 ft ) is typical . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The range of the creek whaler is restricted to northern Australia , between Gladstone in central Queensland and Cape Cuvier in Western Australia . It is a common species that inhabits estuaries and inshore waters from the intertidal zone to a depth of at least 40 m ( 130 ft ) . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 The creek whaler feeds predominantly on small teleost fishes ( including <unk> breams and lizardfishes ) and crustaceans ( including penaeid prawns and mantis shrimps ) ; cephalopods are also infrequently consumed . Known parasites of this species include the tapeworm Callitetrarhynchus gracilis , and a nematode in the genus <unk> . 
 Like other members of its family , the creek whaler is viviparous , with the developing embryos receiving nourishment from the mother through a placental connection formed from the depleted yolk sac . Females produce litters of one to seven young every year . Mating occurs between May and July , with the females storing the sperm until ovulation takes place between July and September . After a gestation period of seven to 9 months , birthing occurs between February and May of the following year . The newborns measure 35 – 50 cm ( 14 – 20 in ) long and spend their first few months of life in shallow , inshore nursery areas such as Cleveland Bay in north Queensland . Males and females attain sexual maturity at lengths of around 83 – 88 cm ( 33 – 35 in ) and 90 – 100 cm ( 35 – 39 in ) , respectively . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 The creek whaler is a minor bycatch of inshore gillnet fisheries operating in northern Australia ; the meat is sold for human consumption . Given its relatively high reproductive rate , its population appears capable of withstanding present levels of fishing . Therefore , the IUCN has listed this species under Least Concern . 
 = R. V. C. Bodley = 
 Ronald Victor Courtenay ( R. V. C. ) Bodley , MC ( 3 March 1892 – 26 May 1970 ) was a British Army officer , author and journalist . Born to English parents in Paris , he lived in France until he was nine , before attending Eton College and then the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst . He was commissioned into the King 's Royal Rifle Corps and served with them during the First World War . After the war he spent seven years in the Sahara desert , and then travelled through Asia . Bodley wrote several books about his travels . He was considered among the most distinguished British writers on the Sahara , as well as one of the main western sources of information on the South Pacific Mandates . 
 Bodley moved to the United States in 1935 , where he worked as a screenwriter . He re @-@ enlisted in the British Army at the outbreak of the Second World War and was sent to Paris to work for the Ministry of Information . He later immigrated to the United States , where he continued to work as a writer and also as an advisor to the United States Office of War Information . 
 = = Early life and First World War = = 
 Bodley was born in Paris on 3 March 1892 to civil servant and writer John Edward Courtenay Bodley and Evelyn Frances Bodley ( née Bell ) . He was the oldest of three children ; his brother Josselin and sister Ava were born in 1893 and 1896 respectively . Bodley was a cousin of Gertrude Bell , a writer and archeologist who helped establish the Hashemite dynasties , and he was also a descendant of diplomat and scholar Sir Thomas Bodley , founder of the Bodleian Library . He lived in France with his parents until he was nine . His grandfather owned a Turkish palace in Algiers , which Bodley often visited as a child . 
 Bodley was educated at a Lycée in Paris before he was sent to Eton College and then to the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst . Bodley showed interest as a writer during this time , writing poetry at Eton and for a cadet magazine at Sandhurst . From Sandhurst he was commissioned into the King 's Royal Rifle Corps as a second lieutenant in September 1911 . He spent three years serving in a regiment in India where he began to write and stage plays . His commanding officer once remarked " The plays are amusing . You 're a credit to the regiment and all that , but did you join the army to become a soldier or a comedian ? " Shortly thereafter the First World War commenced , and Bodley was sent to the Western Front for four years . He was wounded several times , including by chemical gas . At the age of 26 he was given the rank of lieutenant colonel and command of a battalion . He was appointed assistant military attaché to Paris on 15 August 1918 , and attended the 1919 Paris Peace Conference . What he heard there reportedly made him feel that he and the millions of other soldiers had fought for nothing ; he wrote later that " selfish politicians [ were ] laying the groundwork for the Second World War – each country grabbing all it could for itself , creating national antagonisms , and reviving the intrigues of secret . " Disillusioned with the military , Bodley considered a career in politics instead , on the advice of David Lloyd George . 
 Gertrude Bell introduced Bodley to T. E. Lawrence . Bodley ran into Lawrence one day outside the Paris Peace Conference and told him of his intent to move into politics . Lawrence responded furiously , calling him a moron and a traitor . When he replied that he had no other prospects now that the war was over and asking what he should do , Lawrence suggested " Go live with the Arabs . " Bodley said his conversation with Lawrence , which lasted " less than 200 seconds " , proved to be life @-@ changing . He promptly sorted his affairs and went to live in the Sahara . His bemused friends held him a farewell party . They all agreed he would be back in six weeks ; he stayed in the Sahara for seven years . 
 = = Travels through the Sahara and Asia = = 
 Bodley spent his seven years in the Sahara desert living with a nomad Bedouin tribe . He purchased a herd of sheep and goats and used them as a source of income . He hired 10 shepherds to care for his flock , and consistently earned 120 % on his investment . He wore Arab dress , spoke Arabic , practiced the Muslim faith and abstained from alcohol ; Bodley continued to be a non @-@ drinker after leaving the Sahara . He left the tribe on the advice of its chief , who told him there was no use in continuing to pretend to be an Arab . In 1927 he wrote Algeria From Within , after being encouraged to do so by publisher Michael Joseph . The book is based on his experiences living in the country . The book 's success greatly exceeded his expectations , prompting him to continue writing . His first novel , Yasmina , was published later that year ; it sold well and was reprinted . His next novel , Opal Fire , published the following year , was a commercial failure , though this did not discourage him from continuing to write . He regarded his time in the Sahara as " the most peaceful and contented years " of his life . He was considered amongst the most distinguished British writers on the Sahara . 
 After leaving the Sahara , Bodley spent three months in Java working on a tea plantation , before travelling to China and Japan . The success of Algeria From Within made it easy for him to obtain work as a journalist in Asia . He became a foreign correspondent for The Sphere in London and The Advertiser in Australia . Bodley was one of several westerners to be granted access to the South Pacific Mandates by Japan in the 1930s , and he has been cited as one of the main sources of information on the area at the time . Like other westerners allowed to visit the region , he reported that there was no evidence that Japan was <unk> the area . Bodley 's movements were " carefully choreographed " by the <unk> @-@ shō . He wrote about his experiences and findings in his 1934 book The Drama in the Pacific , in which he wrote , " having visited practically every island … I am convinced that nothing has been done to convert any place into a naval base " . In his 1998 book Nan 'yo : the Rise and Fall of the Japanese in Micronesia , 1885 – 1945 , Mark Peattie stated that while it is easy to accuse Bodley and the other writers of naivety , the militarisation of the area was complex and occurred in several stages . Bodley was a passenger aboard the ship Shizuoka Maru when it was wrecked on a reef north of Yap in April 1933 . The vessel was lost , though there were no injuries . Bodley was offered a job teaching English at Keio University , and did so for nine months ; he wrote about the experience in his 1933 book A Japanese Omelette . Bodley and Keio university Professor <unk> Hori provided voluminous notes in the 1934 Japanese textbook version of Round the Red Lamp by Arthur Conan Doyle , and in 1935 Bodley published a biography of Tōgō Heihachirō . 
 = = Later life = = 
 In 1935 Bodley moved to the United States to work as a screenwriter , leaving Japan aboard the Chichibu Maru . In October 1936 Bodley was hired by Charlie Chaplin to adapt the D.L. Murray novel Regency into a feature film . It was the first time Chaplin had hired someone to write a script ; he had previously written his own scripts . Bodley had a rough draft ready by January 1937 , and completed his work in March , though in late May that year Chaplin abandoned the script , in favour of another project he was working on . Bodley also worked on the script for the 1938 film A Yank at Oxford . In the United States Bodley was known to his friends as " Ronnie " and was often referred to in the press as Bodley of Arabia . 
 When the Second World War commenced , Bodley immediately rejoined the King 's Royal Rifle Corps and was given the rank of major , though according to his book The Gay Deserters he was regarded as too old for active service in the infantry . He was instead sent to work for the Ministry of Information in Paris . He was in Paris when the German army invaded in 1940 . According to his book The Soundless Sahara after Paris fell he went to work behind the German lines until he came under suspicion of the Gestapo , then escaped across the Pyrenees on foot . He returned to the United States via Portugal . Upon his return he became a US citizen and an advisor to the Arabic desk of the US Office of War Information , and focused on a career in writing and lecturing . Bodley would go into complete isolation in order to write a book , spending about 10 weeks to complete his work . He wrote several of his books in York Harbor , Maine . Bodley frequently gave lectures while travelling the United States , speaking in almost every state and referring to himself as " Colonel " or " Major " . Having reached the mandatory age for retirement , he ceased to be a member of the British Army on 3 March 1943 . 
 In 1944 Bodley published Wind in the Sahara . By 1949 the book was in its seventh edition and had been translated into eight different languages . In 1945 he wrote the satire novel The Gay Deserters , which was inspired by his flight from the German army , though it was not well received . Robert Pick from the Saturday Review wrote " it isn 't even humorous at all . " He wrote an essay entitled I Lived in the Garden of Allah , which was featured in the 1948 book How to Stop Worrying and Start Living . In 1953 he wrote The Warrior Saint , a biography on Charles de Foucauld . John Cogley from The New York Times said Bodley had " written a clean , poetic and frankly admiring account " of Foucauld 's life . In 1955 he wrote the partly @-@ autobiographical self @-@ help book In Search of Serenity . Elsie Robinson from The Index @-@ Journal and Phyllis Battle from the Tipton Tribune gave favourable reviews , with Robinson calling it " a must for every <unk> spirit " . His next and final book , The Soundless Sahara , was published in 1968 ; according to the book 's back cover he spent part of his years living in Massachusetts , and the rest in either England or France . He provided information for the book The Secret Lives of Lawrence of Arabia , which was published by Thomas Nelson in 1969 . He died on 26 May 1970 in a nursing home in Bramley , Surrey .

 Bodley married Ruth Mary Elizabeth Stapleton @-@ Bretherton on 30 April 1917 while on furlough . They had one son , Mark Courtenay Bodley , born 22 May 1918 . His wife filed for divorce on the grounds that Bodley was adulterous and drank excessively . He did not contest the petition and the divorce was finalised on 8 June 1926 . In his 1931 memoir <unk> of a Young Man , Bodley said the marriage was an " unfortunate action " which " proved the folly of very young people ignoring the advice of their parents . " In 1927 he married Australian Beatrice Claire Lamb , who he met while travelling in North Africa . She filed for divorce around 1939 . Bodley 's son , who became a lieutenant in the Royal Armoured Corps , was killed in action in Libya in 1942 ; Wind in the Sahara is dedicated to him . In November 1949 Bodley married American divorcee Harriet Moseley ; according to The Soundless Sahara , published in 1968 , they were still married . According to a biographical journal article on Bodley by William Snell from Keio University , there is very little information on his last years , but he believed that Bodley 's marriage to Moseley ended in divorce no later than 1969 .

 = Richard Neville , 16th Earl of Warwick = 
 Richard Neville , 16th Earl of Warwick KG ( 22 November 1428 – 14 April 1471 ) , known as Warwick the Kingmaker , was an English nobleman , administrator , and military commander . The son of Richard Neville , 5th Earl of Salisbury , Warwick was the wealthiest and most powerful English peer of his age , with political connections that went beyond the country 's borders . One of the leaders in the Wars of the Roses , originally on the Yorkist side but later switching to the Lancastrian side , he was instrumental in the deposition of two kings , a fact which later earned him his epithet of " Kingmaker " to later generations . 
 Through fortunes of marriage and inheritance , Warwick emerged in the 1450s at the centre of English politics . Originally a supporter of King Henry VI , a territorial dispute with the Duke of Somerset led him to collaborate with Richard , Duke of York , in opposing the king . From this conflict he gained the strategically valuable post of Captain of Calais , a position that benefited him greatly in the years to come . The political conflict later turned into full @-@ scale rebellion , where in battle York was slain , as was Warwick 's father Salisbury . York 's son , however , later triumphed with Warwick 's assistance , and was crowned King Edward IV . Edward initially ruled with Warwick 's support , but the two later fell out over foreign policy and the king 's choice of Elizabeth Woodville as his wife . After a failed plot to crown Edward 's brother , George , Duke of Clarence , Warwick instead restored Henry VI to the throne . The triumph was short @-@ lived however : on 14 April 1471 Warwick was defeated by Edward at the Battle of Barnet , and killed . 
 Warwick had no sons . The elder of his two daughters , Isabel , married George , Duke of Clarence . His younger daughter Anne had a short @-@ lived marriage to King Henry 's son Edward of Westminster , who died in battle at the age of 17 . She then married King Edward 's younger brother Richard , Duke of Gloucester , who later became King Richard III . 
 Warwick 's historical legacy has been a matter of much dispute . Historical opinion has alternated between seeing him as self @-@ centred and rash , and regarding him as a victim of the whims of an ungrateful king . It is generally agreed , however , that in his own time he enjoyed great popularity in all layers of society , and that he was skilled at appealing to popular sentiments for political support . 
 = = Becoming Warwick = = 
 The Nevilles , an ancient Durham family , came to prominence in England 's fourteenth @-@ century wars against the Scots . In 1397 King Richard II made Ralph Neville Earl of Westmorland . Ralph 's son Richard , the later Earl of Warwick 's father , was a younger son by a second marriage , and not heir to the earldom . He received a favourable settlement , however , and became jure uxoris Earl of Salisbury through his marriage to Alice , daughter and heiress of Thomas Montacute , 4th Earl of Salisbury . 
 Salisbury 's son Richard , the later Earl of Warwick , was born on 22 November 1428 ; little is known of his childhood . At the age of six , Richard was betrothed to Anne Beauchamp , daughter of Richard de Beauchamp , 13th Earl of Warwick , and of his wife Isabel Despenser . This made him heir not only to the earldom of Salisbury , but also to a substantial part of the Montague , Beauchamp , and Despenser inheritance . 
 Circumstances would , however , increase his fortune even further . Beauchamp 's son Henry , who had married Richard 's sister Cecily , died in 1446 . When Henry 's daughter Anne died in 1449 , Richard also found himself jure uxoris Earl of Warwick . Richard 's succession to the estates did not go undisputed , however . A protracted battle over parts of the inheritance ensued , particularly with Edmund Beaufort , 1st Duke of Somerset , who had married a daughter from Richard Beauchamp 's first marriage . The dispute centred on land , not on the Warwick title , as Henry 's half @-@ sisters were excluded from the succession . 
 By 1445 Richard had become a knight , probably at Margaret of Anjou 's coronation on 22 April that year . He is visible in the historical record of service of King Henry VI in 1449 , which makes mention of his services in a grant . He performed military service in the north with his father , and might have taken part in the war against Scotland in 1448 – 1449 . When Richard , Duke of York , unsuccessfully rose up against the king in 1452 , both Warwick and his father rallied to the side of King Henry VI . 
 = = Civil War = = 
 In June 1453 , Somerset was granted custody of the lordship of Glamorgan – part of the Despenser heritage held by Warwick until then – and open conflict broke out between the two men . Then , in the summer of that year , King Henry fell ill . Somerset was a favourite of the king and Queen Margaret , and with the king incapacitated he was virtually in complete control of government . This put Warwick at a disadvantage in his dispute with Somerset , and drove him into collaboration with York . The political climate , influenced by the military defeat in France , then started turning against Somerset . On 27 March 1454 , a group of royal councillors appointed the Duke of York protector of the realm . York could now count on the support not only of Warwick , but also of Warwick 's father Salisbury , who had become more deeply involved in disputes with the Percys in the north of England . 
 York 's first protectorate did not last long . Early in 1455 the king rallied sufficiently to return to power , at least nominally , with Somerset again wielding real power . Warwick returned to his estates , as did York and Salisbury , and the three started raising troops . Marching towards London , they encountered the king at St Albans , where the two forces clashed . The battle was brief and not particularly bloody , but it was the first instance of armed hostilities between the forces of the Houses of York and Lancaster in the conflict known as the Wars of the Roses . It was also significant because it resulted in the capture of the king , and the death of Somerset . 
 York 's second protectorate that followed was even shorter @-@ lived than the first . At the parliament of February 1456 the king – now under the influence of Queen Margaret – resumed personal government of the realm . By this time Warwick had taken over Salisbury 's role as York 's main ally , even appearing at that same parliament to protect York from retributions . This conflict was also a pivotal period in Warwick 's career , as it was resolved by his appointment as Constable of Calais . The post was to provide him with a vital power base in the following years of conflict . The continental town of Calais , conquered from France in 1347 , was not only of vital strategic importance , it also held what was England 's largest standing army . There were some initial disputes , with the garrison and with the royal wool monopoly known as the staple , over payments in arrears , but in July Warwick finally took up his post . 
 After the recent events , Queen Margaret still considered Warwick a threat to the throne , and cut off his supplies . In August 1457 , however , a French attack on the English seaport of Sandwich set off fears of a full @-@ scale French invasion . Warwick was again funded to protect the garrison and patrol the English coast . In disregard of royal authority , he then conducted highly successful acts of piracy , against the Castilian fleet in May 1458 , and against the Hanseatic fleet a few weeks later . He also used his time on the Continent to establish relations with Charles VII of France and Philip the Good of Burgundy . Developing a solid military reputation and with good international connections , he then brought a part of his garrison to England , where he met up with his father and York in the summer of 1459 . 
 = = House of York triumphant = = 
 In September 1459 Warwick crossed over to England and made his way north to Ludlow to meet up with Salisbury , the latter fresh from his victory over Lancastrians at the battle of Blore Heath , and York . At nearby Ludford Bridge their forces were scattered by the king 's army , partly because of the defection of Warwick 's Calais contingent under the command of Andrew Trollope . As it turned out , the majority of the soldiers were still reluctant to raise arms against the king . Forced to flee the country , York left for Dublin , Ireland , with his second son Edmund , Earl of Rutland , while Warwick and Salisbury sailed to Calais , accompanied by the duke 's son , Edward , Earl of March ( the future King Edward IV ) . Henry Beaufort , Duke of Somerset , was appointed to replace Warwick as Captain of Calais , but the Yorkists managed to hold on to the garrison . 
 In March 1460 Warwick visited York in Ireland to plan the way ahead , and returned to Calais . Then , on 26 June , he landed at Sandwich with Salisbury and March , and from here the three earls rode north to London . Salisbury was left to besiege the Tower of London , while Warwick took March with him in pursuit of the king . At Northampton , on 10 July , King Henry was taken captive , while the Duke of Buckingham and others were killed in battle . 
 In September York arrived from Ireland , and at the parliament of October that year , the duke walked up to the throne and put his hand on it . The act , signifying usurpation , left the assembly in shock . It is unclear whether Warwick had prior knowledge of York 's plans , though it is assumed that this had been agreed upon between the two in Ireland the previous March . It soon became clear , however , that this regime change was unacceptable to the lords in parliament , and a compromise was agreed . The Act of Accord of 31 October 1460 stated that while Henry VI was allowed to stay on the throne for the remainder of his life , his son Edward , Prince of Wales , was to be disinherited . Instead , York would succeed the king , and act as protector . 
 This solution was not ideal to either party , and further conflict was inevitable . On 30 December , at the Battle of Wakefield , York was killed , as were York 's second son Edmund , Earl of Rutland , and Warwick 's younger brother Thomas . Salisbury was executed a day later . Warwick marched north to confront the enemy , but was defeated and forced to flee at the Second Battle of St Albans . He then joined forces with Prince Edward of York , the new Yorkist claimant to the crown , who had just won an important victory at the Battle of Mortimer 's Cross . 
 While Queen Margaret was hesitating to make her next move , Warwick and Edward hastened to London . The citizens of the capital were scared by the brutal conduct of the Lancastrian forces , and were sympathetic to the House of York . On 4 March the prince was proclaimed King Edward IV , by an assembly that gathered quickly . The new king now headed north to consolidate his title , and met with the Lancastrian forces at Towton in Yorkshire . Warwick had suffered an injury to the leg the day before , in the Battle of Ferrybridge , and may have played only a minor part in the battle that followed . The unusually bloody battle resulted in a complete victory for the Yorkist forces , and the death of many important men on the opposing side , such as Henry Percy , Earl of Northumberland , and Andrew Trollope . Queen Margaret managed to escape to Scotland , with Henry and Prince Edward . Edward IV returned to London for his coronation , while Warwick remained to pacify the north . 
 = = Warwick 's apex = = 
 Warwick 's position after the accession of Edward IV was stronger than ever . He had now succeeded to his father 's possessions , and in 1462 he also inherited his mother 's lands and the Salisbury title . Altogether he had an annual income from his lands of over £ 7 @,@ 000 far more than any other man in the realm but the king . Edward confirmed Warwick 's position as Captain of Calais , and made him Admiral of England and Steward of the Duchy of Lancaster , along with several other offices . His brothers also benefited : John Neville , Lord Montagu , was made Warden of the East March in 1463 , and the next year created Earl of Northumberland . George Neville , Bishop of Exeter , was confirmed in his post as chancellor by King Edward , and in 1465 promoted to the archbishopric of York . 
 By late 1461 , risings in the north had been put down , and in the summer of 1462 , Warwick negotiated a truce with Scotland . In October the same year , Margaret of Anjou invaded England with troops from France , and managed to take the castles of Alnwick and Bamburgh . Warwick had to organise the recapture of the castles , which was accomplished by January 1463 . The leaders of the rebellion , including Sir Ralph Percy , were pardoned and left in charge of the retaken castles . At this point , Warwick felt secure enough to travel south ; in February he buried the remains of his father and brother at Bisham Priory , and in March he attended parliament at Westminster . 
 That same spring , however , the north rose up in rebellion once more , when Ralph Percy laid siege to Norham Castle . Warwick returned to the north and rescued Norham , but the Lancastrians were left in possession of Northumberland , and the government decided on a diplomatic approach instead . Separate truces were negotiated with Scotland and France , which allowed Warwick to retake the Northumbrian castles held by the Lancastrian rebels . This time no clemency was given , and around thirty of the rebel leaders were executed .

 At the negotiations with the French , Warwick had intimated that King Edward was interested in a marriage arrangement with the French crown , the intended bride being Louis XI 's sister @-@ in @-@ law , Bona , daughter of Louis , Duke of Savoy . This marriage was not to be , however , because in September 1464 , Edward revealed that he was already married , to Elizabeth Woodville . The marriage caused great offence to Warwick : not only due to the fact that his plans had been sabotaged , but also the secrecy with which the king had acted . The marriage – contracted on 1 May of the same year – was not made public before Warwick pressed Edward on the issue at a council meeting , and in the meanwhile Warwick had been unknowingly deceiving the French into believing the king was serious about the marriage proposal . For Edward the marriage may very well have been a love match , but in the long run he sought to build the Woodville family into a powerhouse independent of Warwick 's influence . 
 This was not enough to cause a complete fallout between the two men , though from this point on Warwick increasingly stayed away from court . The promotion of Warwick 's brother George to Archbishop of York shows that the earl was still in favour with the king . In July 1465 , when Henry VI was once more captured , it was Warwick who escorted the fallen king to his captivity in the Tower . 
 Then , in the spring of 1466 , Warwick was sent to the continent to carry out negotiations with the French and Burgundians . The negotiations centred around a marriage proposal involving Edward 's sister Margaret . Warwick increasingly came to favour French diplomatic connections . Meanwhile , Edward 's father @-@ in @-@ law , Richard Woodville , Earl Rivers , who had been created treasurer , was in favour of a Burgundian alliance . This set up internal conflict within the English court , which was not alleviated by the fact that Edward had signed a secret treaty in October with Burgundy , while Warwick was forced to carry on sham negotiations with the French . Later , George Neville was dismissed as chancellor , while Edward refused to contemplate a marriage between Warwick 's oldest daughter Isabel , and Edward 's brother George , Duke of Clarence . It became increasingly clear that Warwick 's position of dominance at court had been taken over by Rivers . 
 In the autumn of 1467 , there were rumours that Warwick was now sympathetic to the Lancastrian cause , but even though he refused to come to court to answer the charges , the king accepted his denial in writing . In July the same year , it was revealed that Warwick 's deputy in Calais , John , Lord Wenlock , was involved in a Lancastrian conspiracy , and early in 1469 another Lancastrian plot was uncovered , involving John de Vere , Earl of Oxford . It was becoming clear that the discontent with Edward 's reign was widespread , a fact that Warwick could exploit . 
 = = Rebellion and death = = 
 Warwick now orchestrated a rebellion in Yorkshire while he was away , led by a " Robin of Redesdale " . Part of Warwick 's plan was winning over Edward 's brother George , possibly with the prospect of installing him on the throne . The nineteen @-@ year @-@ old George had shown himself to share many of the abilities of his older brother , but was also jealous and overambitious . In July the two sailed over to Calais where George was married to Isabel . From there they returned to England , where they gathered the men of Kent to join the rebellion in the north . Meanwhile , the king 's forces were defeated at Edgecote , where William Herbert , Earl of Pembroke , was killed . The other commander , Humphrey Stafford , Earl of Devon , was caught in flight and lynched by a mob . Later , Earl Rivers and his son John were also apprehended and murdered . With his army now defeated , the king was taken under arrest by Archbishop Neville . He was imprisoned in Warwick , and in August taken north to Middleham Castle . In the long run , however , it proved impossible to rule without the king , and continuing disorder forced Warwick to release Edward in September 1469 . 
 A modus vivendi had been achieved between Warwick and the king for some months , but the restoration of Henry Percy to Montagu 's earldom of Northumberland prevented any chance of full reconciliation . A trap was set for the king when disturbances in Lincolnshire led him north , where he could be confronted by Warwick 's men . Edward , however , discovered the plot when Robert , Lord Welles , was routed at <unk> Field , and gave away the plan . 
 Warwick soon gave up , and once more fled the country with Clarence . Denied access to Calais , they sought refuge with King Louis XI of France . Louis arranged a reconciliation between Warwick and Margaret of Anjou , and as part of the agreement , Margaret and Henry 's son , Edward , Prince of Wales , would marry Warwick 's daughter Anne . The objective of the alliance was to restore Henry VI to the throne . Again Warwick staged an uprising in the north , and with the king away , he and Clarence landed at Dartmouth and Plymouth on 13 September 1470 . Among the many who flocked to Warwick 's side was his brother Montagu , who had not taken part in the last rebellion , but was disappointed when his loyalty to the king had not been rewarded with the restoration of his earldom . This time the trap set up for the king worked ; as Edward hurried south , Montagu 's forces approached from the north , and the king found himself surrounded . On 2 October he fled to the Netherlands . King Henry was now restored , with Warwick acting as the true ruler in his capacity as lieutenant . At a parliament in November , Edward was attainted of his lands and titles , and Clarence was awarded the Duchy of York . 
 At this point , international affairs intervened . Louis XI declared war on Burgundy , and Duke Charles responded by granting an expeditionary force to Edward IV , in order to reclaim his throne . On 14 March Edward landed at Ravenspurn in Yorkshire , with the acquiescence of the Earl of Northumberland . Warwick was still waiting for Queen Margaret and her son Edward , who were supposed to bring reinforcements from France , but were kept on the continent by bad weather . At this point Edward received the support of his brother Clarence , who realised that he had been disadvantaged by the new agreement with the Lancastrians . Clarence 's defection weakened Warwick , who nevertheless went in pursuit of Edward . On 14 April 1471 the two armies met at Barnet . Fog and poor visibility on the field led to confusion , and the Lancastrian army ended up attacking its own men . In the face of defeat Warwick attempted to escape the field , but was struck off his horse and killed . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Warwick 's body – along with that of his brother Montagu , who had also fallen at Barnet – was displayed in London 's St Paul 's Cathedral to quell any rumours of their survival . Then they were handed over to Archbishop Neville , to be buried in the family vault at Bisham Priory near the river Thames in Berkshire . No trace now remains of either the tomb or the church in which it was housed . On 4 May of the same year ( 1471 ) , Edward IV defeated the remaining Lancastrian forces of Queen Margaret and Prince Edward at the Battle of Tewkesbury , where the prince was killed . Soon afterwards , it was reported that King Henry VI had also died in the Tower . With the direct Lancastrian line exterminated , Edward could reign safely until his death in 1483 . 
 Warwick 's offices were divided between King Edward 's brothers George , Duke of Clarence { who had married Warwick 's daughter Isabel Neville } , and Richard , Duke of Gloucester , the future Richard III . Clarence received the <unk> of England and the lieutenancy of Ireland , while Gloucester was made Admiral of England and Warden of the West March . Clarence also received the earldoms of Warwick and Salisbury . The earl 's land had been forfeited and taken into the king 's custody . When Gloucester married Warwick 's younger daughter Anne in 1472 , who had been recently widowed by the death of Prince Edward , a dispute broke out between the two princes over the Beauchamp and Despenser inheritances . A compromise was eventually reached , whereby the land was divided , but Clarence was not pacified . In 1477 he once again plotted against his brother . This time the king could no longer act with lenience , and the next year the Duke of Clarence was executed . 
 = = Historical assessment = = 
 Early sources on Richard Neville fall into two categories . The first are the sympathetic chronicles of the early Yorkist years , or works based on these , such as the Mirror for Magistrates ( 1559 ) . The other category originates with chronicles commissioned by Edward IV after Warwick 's fall , such as the Historie of the <unk> of Edward IV , and take a more negative view of the earl . The Mirror portrayed Warwick as a great man : beloved by the people , and betrayed by the man he helped raise to the throne . The other perspective can be found in Shakespeare 's Henry VI trilogy : a man driven by pride and egotism , who created and deposed kings at will . 
 In time , however , it is the latter view that dominated . The Enlightenment , or Whig historians of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries , decried anyone who impeded the development towards a centralised , constitutional monarchy , the way Warwick did in his struggles with Edward . David Hume called Warwick " the greatest , as well as the last , of those mighty barons who formerly overawed the crown , and rendered the people incapable of any regular system of civil government . " Later writers were split between admiration for some of Warwick 's character traits , and condemnation of his political actions . The romantic novelist Lord Lytton picked up on Hume 's theme in his The Last of the Barons . Though Lytton portrayed Warwick as a tragic hero who embodied the ideals of chivalry , he was nevertheless one whose time was past . The late @-@ nineteenth century military historian Charles Oman acknowledged the earl 's ability to appeal to popular sentiments , yet pointed out his deficiencies as a military commander . Oman found Warwick a traditional strategist , " not attaining the heights of military genius displayed by his pupil Edward . " Paul Murray Kendall 's popular biography from 1957 took a sympathetic view of Warwick , but concluded that he had ultimately fallen victim to his own overreaching ambition . 
 More recent historians , such as Michael Hicks and A. J. Pollard , have tried to see Warwick in light of the standards of his own age , rather than holding him up to contemporary constitutional ideals . The insults Warwick suffered at the hands of King Edward – including Edward 's secret marriage , and the refusal of the French diplomatic channel – were significant . His claim to prominence in national affairs was not a product of illusions of grandeur ; it was confirmed by the high standing he enjoyed among the princes on the continent . Furthermore , Warwick 's cause was not considered unjust by his contemporaries , which can be seen by the earl 's popularity exceeding that of the king at the time of his first rebellion in 1469 . On the other hand , while Warwick could not easily suffer his treatment by the king , it was equally impossible for Edward to accept the earl 's presence on the political scene . As long as Warwick remained as powerful and influential as he was , Edward could not fully assert his royal authority , and eventual confrontation became inevitable . 
 = = Coat of arms = = 
 The Earl of Warwick 's coat of arms was unusually complex for the period , with seven different quarterings . The first quarter consists of the arms of his father @-@ in @-@ law , Richard de Beauchamp , 13th Earl of Warwick , who bore his arms with an escutcheon of De Clare quartering Despenser ( the arms of his wife Isabel le Despenser ) , which Warwick showed in the fourth quarter . The second quarter showed the arms of the <unk> ( quartered with the Monthermer arms ) . The third quarter showed the arms of Neville differenced by a label for Lancaster to signify descent from Warwick 's father , the Earl of Salisbury , who was the eldest son and heir of Ralph Neville , 1st Earl of Westmorland and his wife , Lady Joan Beaufort , daughter of the Duke of Lancaster .
