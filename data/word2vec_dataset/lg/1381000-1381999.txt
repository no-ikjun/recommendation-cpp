They also described the boss levels as " insultingly easy " . Cooke observed that , like its predecessor , the game did not add anything to the genre and summarized that " the first Crash was <unk> similar to the 16 @-@ bit platform games of <unk> @-@ yore , only with better graphics , and Crash 2 doesn 't deviate much from this formula . " He also described the " bizarre " lenticular 3D cover art of the game as " unnecessary and evil " and " a device of unprecedented agony " , claiming to have contracted a massive headache after " looking at it in [ his ] car for about 15 seconds " .

 Robert Todd Pelinka , Jr . ( born December 23 , 1969 ) is an American lawyer , National Basketball Association ( NBA ) sports agent and former college basketball player from Lake Bluff , Illinois ( suburban Chicago ) . He is best known as Kobe Bryant 's agent and President and CEO of The Landmark Sports Agency , LLC . Pelinka has represented many players who have been NBA Draft Lottery picks since the 2003 NBA draft , including two at the 2010 NBA draft and 2nd overall 2011 NBA draft selection Derrick Williams . Pelinka represented Dion Waiters and Andre Drummond in the 2012 NBA draft who were selected 4th and 9th overall , respectively . Pelinka was formerly Kevin Durant 's agent and has been involved in controversy as Carlos Boozer 's agent . 
 Pelinka played basketball for Lake Forest High School , earning All @-@ American honors . As a junior , he led Lake Forest High School to its first conference championship . Entering his senior season , Pelinka was overlooked by many Division I scouts and recruiters . However , his MVP performance in a four @-@ game tournament , where he made all 42 of his free throws , and his impressive season statistics enabled him to become a highly recruited athlete by the end of his senior year . He was selected to several regional all @-@ star lists and to play on several regional all @-@ star teams as a senior . 
 He attended the University of Michigan , where he has the distinction of being the only person in school history to have been a member of three National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) Final Four teams : the 1988 – 89 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Champion Wolverines basketball team as well as both the 1991 – 92 and the 1992 – 93 national championship runners @-@ up , which were best remembered as the Fab Five teams . Pelinka holds a Juris Doctor cum laude from the University of Michigan Law School ( 1996 ) and Bachelor of Business Administration from the University of Michigan Ross School of Business ( 1993 ) . Pelinka was also named the 1993 NCAA Male Walter Byers Scholar Athlete of the Year .

 Pelinka is the son of a Robert Todd Pelinka , Sr. , a former high school basketball coach who taught him the fundamentals of basketball . He became a high school All @-@ American basketball player at Lake Forest High School . By the time he was a junior teammate of long @-@ time Chicago Bears quarterback Bobby Douglass ' stepson , Bill Douglass , he was regarded as one of the best shooters in the Chicago area . As a 6 ft 3 @.@ 5 in ( 1 @.@ 92 m ) junior , he led Lake Forest to their first conference championship as an all @-@ conference guard . However , the team lost in the first round of postseason play in 1987 . Pelinka also played in the Chicago pro @-@ amateur leagues where he played against local stars such as Mark Aguirre , Tim Hardaway , Kevin Duckworth and Kendall Gill . 
 By his senior season , he was listed at 6 ft 6 in ( 1 @.@ 98 m ) , and moved to the point guard position from the shooting guard position in the absence of Douglass , who had graduated and joined future Big Ten opponent Wisconsin , as a starting point guard . As a senior , Pelinka was a preseason selection by the Chicago Sun @-@ Times as one of the top 50 Chicago metropolitan area high school basketball players and top five North Suburban players . However , he was not a national preseason top 500 pick by Street & Smith 's basketball magazine , which may have been because his senior season marked the first season that the three @-@ point shot was adopted by state high school associations and Pelinka was mainly a shooter . Furthermore , scouts such as Chicago @-@ based David Kaplan , who questioned his true height and dribbling ability , doubted whether he was talented enough to play for either of his targeted colleges ( Michigan and Notre Dame ) even in late December of his senior year despite his having had multiple 30 @-@ point efforts already . 
 During the four @-@ game December 1987 Elgin tournament , in which he was named MVP , Pelinka made all 41 of his free throws and recorded a tournament record 139 points , including 45 in one game . Pelinka 's streak of consecutive free throws made ended at 45 , but later recounts showed he had 42 free throws in the tournament and 46 consecutive overall , which ranked fourth in Illinois high school basketball history at the time of his graduation . After his tournament performance , Pelinka responded through the press to a scout who felt he might be limited to Division II or mid @-@ major programs such as William & Mary that since he was able to score 45 points against a player committed to play for DePaul , he could succeed at the Division I high @-@ major level . He had only been recruited by William & Mary , Navy , Wisconsin @-@ Green Bay and Ivy League schools before his tournament performance . Afterwards , at least three Big Ten Conference schools showed interest — Illinois , Minnesota and Wisconsin — although no scouts were allowed to attend any games before February 8 . 
 By the beginning of February of his senior year , Pelinka was listed as one of the top ten Class AA ( the larger school class ) basketball players in Illinois by Illinois High School Basketball magazine . By the time of the scouting deadline of February 8 , when college scouts could start attending his games , Pelinka was averaging 30 points and 10 rebounds per game ; Illinois , Michigan , Notre Dame and North Carolina showed interest in him . Even previously doubtful scout Kaplan noted that of the players who waited until the April signing period instead of signing in November , Pelinka was one of the best in the Chicago area . 
 At the conclusion of the season , Pelinka had a 30 @-@ point @-@ per @-@ game average that benefited from a 41 % three @-@ point shot percentage over the course of 208 attempts . Pelinka was named to the post- ( regular ) season All @-@ Chicago area top 20 players by the Chicago Sun @-@ Times . He was named among the 20 Class AA All @-@ state players in a class that included Eric Anderson , <unk> Ellis , Acie Earl , and Deon Thomas . In addition to various all @-@ star lists , Pelinka was selected to play for various regional all @-@ star teams . Pelinka 's final decision came down to a choice between Illinois and Michigan . Pelinka chose Michigan because of its academically strong law school and business school . After selecting Michigan , he had notable performances in his regional all @-@ star games , including a 27 @-@ point performance in the annual City @-@ Suburban all @-@ star game .

 As a guard , Pelinka became the first Michigan Wolverine to reach three NCAA Tournament Final Fours during his Michigan Wolverines career . He played in the 1988 – 89 , 1990 – 91 , 1991 – 92 , and 1992 – 93 seasons ; the team reached the championship game of the Final Four in all of those seasons except 1990 – 91 . As a true freshman member of the 1988 – 89 National Champions , his teammates included Glen Rice , Terry Mills , Loy Vaught , Rumeal Robinson , Sean Higgins , Demetrius Calip , and Mark Hughes . As a redshirt member of the 1991 – 92 and 1992 – 93 national runners @-@ up , his teammates included Chris Webber , Juwan Howard , Jalen Rose , Jimmy King , Ray Jackson ( the Fab Five ) , and Eric Riley . He was one of several upperclassmen on the Fab Five teams and served as co @-@ captain of the 1992 – 93 team . As a scholar , he was noted for having a grade point average that rivaled his scoring average . 
 During Pelinka 's freshman season , Michigan was picked by many to win the Big Ten Conference and was ranked number one in the nation , according to some preseason polls . He was the only true freshman to play in either of the first two games of the season . Pelinka 's only start of the season came in the December 12 , 1988 game against Holy Cross . This game followed the team 's first loss of the season , which had come against Division II Alaska – Anchorage , after an 11 – 0 start and after which coach Bill Frieder benched three starters . Pelinka posted his season highs in points ( 8 ) , rebounds ( 5 ) and minutes ( 18 ) in this game . During a practice , Pelinka was knocked unconscious and lost two teeth . As the team entered the March stretch run , Pelinka and Calip were the only reserve guards backing up Robinson and Higgins . The team went on to win the 1989 NCAA Men 's Division I Basketball Tournament against Seton Hall at the Kingdome in Seattle , Washington . When the team visited the White House , Pelinka held Rumeal Robinson 's suit coat , while Robinson and United States President George H. W. Bush reenacted Robinson 's game winning free throws . When tendinitis afflicted his knees , he redshirted the 1989 – 90 season . 
 During his redshirt sophomore season , he was not called on to take many important shots . He did have an opportunity to take a 20 @-@ foot shot with five seconds left in what turned out to be a 76 – 74 loss to Texas on December 29 , 1990 , but he missed the shot . In this game , he played a season @-@ high twenty @-@ eight minutes in his only start of the season and first of his collegiate career . Pelinka was also instrumental in setting up some key shots such as a pass to Calip during a frenetic sequence to tie Minnesota in the waning minutes of the game . The team finished with at 14 – 15 overall ( 7 – 11 Big Ten ) record after losing to Colorado in the first round of the NIT . 
 During his redshirt junior year , he was joined at Michigan by the Fab Five , who were all true freshmen . He was injured for part of the season . When he was healthy , he was an important reserve player . After sitting out the first half , he scored the overtime opening three @-@ point shot and made three of four overtime free throws in an 89 – 79 road victory against Michigan State at the Breslin Center on January 29 , 1992 . Pelinka had also contributed an earlier three @-@ point shot as Michigan erased a thirteen @-@ point deficit to force the overtime . Pelinka also contributed his season @-@ high nineteen minutes and a second @-@ half career @-@ high eleven points ( eclipsed in his senior season ) in a March 11 , 1992 70 – 61 victory against Purdue at the Mackey Arena . Michigan head coach Steve Fisher credited both of these wins to Pelinka and also noted his two important three @-@ point shots against East Tennessee State . The team lost in the final game of the 1992 NCAA Tournament . After the season , he went with the team on a 9 @-@ game 16 @-@ day European trip . According to press accounts , the team was homesick during the trip and Pelinka got sick from drinking tap water . 
 The following season , Michigan returned its top nine scorers and began the season ranked number one in the Associated Press national ranking as Pelinka was part of a quartet of seniors backing up the Fab Five , who had become sophomores . As a 6 ft 6 in ( 1 @.@ 98 m ) 200 @-@ pound ( 91 kg ) fifth @-@ year senior , Pelinka started back @-@ to @-@ back games twice during the season . Early in the season , he started in place of the injured Jackson , but Pelinka came down with the flu after two starts against Kansas and Eastern Michigan on December 30 , 1992 and January 2 , 1993 respectively . During his other set of back @-@ to @-@ back starts against Ohio State and Iowa on January 26 and January 31 , 1993 , Pelinka started even though Jackson played . Pelinka set several season and career highs , including points ( 16 ) , in the 72 – 62 home victory over Ohio State . The sixteen points included six free throws that were among the nine consecutive Michigan made in the final 2 : 13 . 
 During his senior season , Pelinka was an important role player for the team who drew the most charges on the team and contributed important defensive minutes as the sixth man . During the 1992 – 93 season , he led all reserves in minutes and assists and was second in points and rebounds . Pelinka was also instrumental as a leader during the run to the Final Four . Having been the only member of the team in Seattle for the 1989 championship , when the 1993 team played its regional championship games in Seattle , Pelinka was able to show Webber the spot in the locker room where Rice had taken his pre @-@ game nap . During the Final Four weekend in New Orleans , Louisiana , Chris Webber wore Pelinka 's 1989 Championship ring , which only fit on Webber 's pinky finger , and slept with it under his pillow . During the national semifinal 81 – 78 overtime victory against the Kentucky Wildcats , Pelinka played in the clinching overtime period after King fouled out . Nonetheless , despite a pair of early three @-@ point shots by Pelinka after Jackson got two early personal fouls , the team lost in the final game of the 1993 NCAA Tournament against North Carolina . When the team returned to Ann Arbor , Michigan for a rally at Crisler Arena the following day , Pelinka was one of only two Wolverines to speak to the crowd . After his senior season , he played in an NBA Summer Camp in Long Beach , California and considered offers to play professionally in Europe . At this time , he first met sports agent Arn Tellem and decided not to play basketball . As of 2004 he remained in 15th place on the all @-@ time Michigan games played list .

 At Lake Forest High School , Pelinka became a starting basketball player as a junior during the 1986 – 87 season . College basketball regulations allow for two periods in which high school basketball players can make commitments to accept athletic scholarships during their senior years . The first period is in November and the second period is in April . As a result of his junior season athletic and academic performances , he was recruited during the first period by William & Mary , Navy , Wisconsin @-@ Green Bay and Ivy League schools . The schools with traditionally stronger basketball programs largely ignored Pelinka , much to his dismay . His father sent out profiles to newspapers and colleges , and Pelinka decided to wait for the second off @-@ campus recruiting and signing period . As his senior season progressed , top Division I basketball programs began to scout him for athletic scholarship offers . Immediately after his MVP basketball tournament performance in early January , Illinois , Minnesota and Wisconsin became interested in recruiting him . The off @-@ campus recruiting for the April signing period began on February 8 . As the season progressed and Pelinka compiled all @-@ star basketball statistics , the list of top basketball programs increased with schools such as Illinois , Michigan , Notre Dame and North Carolina expressing interest in him by the time of the off @-@ campus recruiting season . Pelinka hoped he would be able to sign with a Big Ten school . When Pelinka made his final decision in April 1988 , he chose Michigan over Illinois . 
 Pelinka entered the Bachelor of Business Administration program at the School of Business Administration where he accumulated a 3 @.@ 9 / 4 @.@ 0 grade point average . During his time at Michigan , he developed a close relationship with University of Michigan tax law professor Doug Kahn and his wife . In January 1993 , Pelinka announced he was accepted to the University of Michigan Law School and the Northwestern University School of Law and stated that he hoped to become a professional sports agent after his athletic and academic careers were complete . After Michigan won the 1993 NCAA West Regional Final , Pelinka , who was one of six finalists , flew to St. Louis , Missouri for a final interview for the Walter Byers Scholarship . Later that week , Pelinka was honored with the 1993 Walter Byers Scholar Award as the NCAA 's top male scholar athlete . Pelinka earned a variety of other scholar athlete awards . 
 Instead of playing basketball in Europe , Pelinka chose to attend Michigan Law School after graduation and became a top law student . During his first year of law school , several of his former teammates appeared in Blue Chips : Billy Douglas ( Lake Forest ) , Eric Anderson ( Chicago All @-@ star ) , and <unk> Calip ( Michigan ) . While in law school , he took several classes from Kahn . During his second year in law school , he became the home game color analyst for Wolverines basketball play @-@ by @-@ play announcer Chuck Swirsky on a 16 @-@ station broadcast network that originated from WJR @-@ AM , and he debuted on December 22 , 1994 during a game against Jackson State University . While in law school , he interned for Winston & <unk> LLP . Pelinka earned his Juris Doctor cum laude in 1996 .

 Pelinka is well known as the agent of Kobe Bryant , who retired at the end of the 2015 – 16 season after 20 seasons as a perennial All @-@ Star guard for the Los Angeles Lakers . In fact , some of his other clients have hired him because of this . During the 2003 sexual assault case against Bryant , Pelinka spent a considerable amount of time with his client . He accompanied him on trips to Eagle , Colorado . It was Pelinka who confirmed the news of Bryant 's second child . In 2004 , when Bryant was a free agent , Pelinka confirmed Bryant would remain in Los Angeles with either the Lakers or the Los Angeles Clippers while rumors were flying that he was going to sign with the Chicago Bulls . Subsequently , when Rudy Tomjanovich was hired to be the Lakers ' head coach , he sent free agent Bryant and Pelinka a video package describing the things he has done for players at Bryant 's position . A few days later , Pelinka negotiated a contract for Bryant to remain with the Lakers for $ 136 @.@ 4 million over seven years . When Bryant demanded to be traded during the 2007 offseason , Pelinka confirmed that " Kobe would like to be moved . "

 Rob Pelinka was involved in a complex negotiation which led to both SFX resigning as the agency for Carlos Boozer and to Pelinka briefly resigning as his agent . Pelinka currently represents Boozer as his agent . The issue involved discrepancies on an unconfirmed handshake agreement between Boozer and the Cavaliers owner Gordon Gund . At the time , Boozer had a $ 700 @,@ 000 option year remaining on his contract with the Cleveland Cavaliers . Boozer had originally been signed to a two @-@ year guaranteed contract for $ 989 @,@ 000 with a team option for the third year . However , his market value was much higher than that after two seasons in the NBA . Supposedly , Cleveland general manager Jim Paxson agreed not to exercise the team ’ s option after Boozer promised to resign with the Cavs for a long term , six @-@ <unk> $ 41 million contract . But once the team option expired , Boozer signed with the Utah Jazz for $ 68 million , an offer the Cavaliers would not match because they were over the NBA salary cap . Pelinka was attacked in the press for allowing his client to go to the highest bidder rather than forcing him to honor the unconfirmed handshake agreement . As a result , SFX dropped Boozer as a client , and Pelinka left the firm . A year later , after a short stint with another agent , Boozer re @-@ hired Pelinka who has become President and CEO of his own sports agency , The Landmark Sports Agency , LLC .

 = Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band ( song ) = 
 " Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band " is a song written by Paul McCartney ( credited to Lennon – McCartney ) , and first recorded and released in 1967 , on the album of the same name by the Beatles . The song appears twice on the album : as the opening track ( segueing into " With a Little Help from My Friends " ) , and as " Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band ( Reprise ) " , the penultimate track ( segueing into " A Day in the Life " ) . As the title song , the lyrics introduce the fictional band that performs on the album . 
 Since its original album release , " Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band " has also been released on various Beatles singles and compilation albums . The song has also been performed by several other artists , including Jimi Hendrix , U2 , and a comic interpretation by Bill Cosby , using the opening to John Philip Sousa 's Washington Post March as the instrumental bridge . 
 = = Authorship and recording = = 
 In November 1966 , on the flight back to England after a holiday , McCartney conceived an idea in which an entire album would be role @-@ played , with each of the Beatles assuming an alter @-@ ego in the " Lonely Hearts Club Band " , which would then perform a concert in front of an audience . The inspiration is said to have come when roadie Mal Evans innocently asked McCartney what the letters " S " and " P " stood for on the pots on their in @-@ flight meal trays , and McCartney explained it was for salt and pepper . This then led to the Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band concept , as well as the song . 
 The group 's road manager , Neil Aspinall , suggested the idea of Sgt. Pepper being the compère , as well as the reprise at the end of the album . According to his diaries , Evans may have also contributed to the song . John Lennon attributed the idea for Sgt. Pepper to McCartney , although the song is officially credited to Lennon – McCartney . The Beatles recorded the track in Abbey Road 's studio 2 , with George Martin producing , and Geoff Emerick engineering . Work on the song started on 1 February 1967 , and after three further sessions the recording was completed on 6 March 1967 . 
 = = Song structure = = 
 On the Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band album , the song opens to the sound of a chattering audience , and an orchestra tuning up , which was taken from the 10 February orchestra session for " A Day in the Life " . The crowd sounds edited into the song were recorded in the early 1960s by Martin , during a live recording of the stage show Beyond the Fringe . The song 's structure is : 
 Introduction ( instrumental ) 
 Verse 
 Bridge ( instrumental ) 
 Refrain 
 Bridge 
 Verse 
 Instrumental bridge and transition into " With a Little Help from My Friends " . 
 The song is in G major , with a 4 / 4 meter . A horn quartet was used to fill out the instrumental sections . 
 = = = Reprise = = = 
 " Sgt. Pepper 's Lonely Hearts Club Band ( Reprise ) " is a modified repeat of the opening song at a faster tempo with heavier instrumentation . The track opens with McCartney 's count @-@ in ( retained in the manner of " I Saw Her Standing There " , the opening song on the Beatles ' first album ) ; between 2 and 3 , Lennon jokingly interjects " Bye ! " Ringo Starr starts the song proper by playing the drum part unaccompanied for four bars , at the end of which a brief bass glissando from McCartney cues the full ensemble of two distorted electric guitars ( played by George Harrison and Lennon ) , bass , drums and overdubbed percussion . In addition , McCartney overdubbed a Hammond organ part onto the track . 
 While the first version of the song had stayed largely in the key of G major ( except for transient modulation to F and perhaps C in the bridges ) , the reprise starts in F and features a modulation , to G. The mono and stereo mixes of the song differ slightly : the former has a fractionally different transition from the previous song , and includes crowd noise and laughter in the opening bars that are absent from the stereo mix . 
 The idea for a reprise was Aspinall 's , who thought that as there was a " welcome song " , there should also be a " goodbye song " . The song contains broadly the same melody as the opening version , but with different lyrics and omitting the " It 's wonderful to be here " section . At 1 : 18 , it is one of the Beatles ' shorter songs ( the shortest is " Her Majesty " at 0 : 23 ) . The reprise was recorded on 1 April 1967 , two months after the version that opens the album . At the end of the track , Martin 's pre @-@ recorded applause sample segues into the final track of the album , " A Day in the Life " .

 = The Quest ( Portland , Oregon ) = 
 The Quest , sometimes referred to as Saturday Night at the Y or Three Groins in a Fountain , is an outdoor marble sculpture and fountain designed by Count Alexander von Svoboda , located in Portland , Oregon in the United States . The sculpture , carved in Italy from a single 200 @-@ ton block of white <unk> marble quarried in Greece , was commissioned by Georgia @-@ Pacific in 1967 and installed in front of the Standard Insurance Center in 1970 . It depicts five nude figures , including three females , one male and one child . According to the artist , the subjects represent man 's eternal search for brotherhood and enlightenment . 
 As of 1990 , The Quest was considered Portland 's largest single piece of white sculptured marble . The abstract , figurative sculpture was surveyed by the Smithsonian Institution 's " Save Outdoor Sculpture ! " program in 1994 and underwent minor repairs . It has received mixed reviews . One critic appreciated how its flowing lines contrasted with the " stark " pillars of the adjacent building , and called the marble " impressive " . Another writer for The Oregonian wrote of her and others ' dislike for the sculpture , saying it serves as a " free sex @-@ education lesson " for schoolchildren . 
 = = Description = = 
 The Quest was designed by Count Alexander von Svoboda , an Austria @-@ born , Toronto @-@ based sculptor . It was commissioned by Georgia @-@ Pacific in 1967 and installed in front of the Standard Insurance Center ( formerly known as the Georgia @-@ Pacific Building ) at Southwest 5th Avenue and Southwest Taylor Street in downtown Portland in 1970 . The stone sculpture was one of nearly 400 in Georgia @-@ Pacific 's private collection , unveiled in Portland with the opening of its world headquarters . Rose Festival princesses presented the work at a formal ceremony . 
 The sculpture was carved in Carrara , Italy , from a single 200 @-@ ton block of white <unk> marble , quarried near Athens . It depicts five " larger than life " nude figures , including three females , one male and one child . The statue is set on a pedestal within a fountain , surrounded by water jets . The figures ' forms curve upward , and two of the females have their hands raised , while the third " sleeps in the rear " . The male figure appears to float and is reaching up with both hands , while the child figure is located behind the foremost female . 
 The Quest measures approximately 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) x 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) x 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) and is sited on a concrete or stone base that measures 22 feet ( 6 @.@ 7 m ) x 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) x 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) and weighs 17 tons . According to the artist , the sculpture is " symbolic of man 's eternal search for brotherhood and enlightenment " . Michelangelo inspired the work , but von Svoboda took a more " humanistic " approach , and 35 stonemasons assisted with the sculpture 's creation , which took two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half years to <unk> von Svoboda 's Perpetuity , a hollowed @-@ out cross @-@ section of a redwood log with a bronze " seedling " radiating outward , served as a " companion " sculpture . Originally installed along the Southwest Fourth Avenue side of the building , the work was relocated to the World Forestry Center . 
 The Smithsonian Institution has categorized The Quest as both abstract and figurative . In 2002 , journalist Sallie Tisdale of The Oregonian described the sculpture as a " large tangle of snow @-@ white bodies in a fountain " . She wrote that the work is privately owned but in public view , and that it has been around " long enough that no one is quite sure how it got there in the first place " . As of 1990 , The Quest was considered Portland 's largest single piece of white sculptured marble . It was surveyed and considered " well maintained " by the Smithsonian 's " Save Outdoor Sculpture ! " program in January 1994 . Maintenance on the sculpture has included caulking and repairs to the male figure 's nose . 
 = = Reception = = 
 The Quest has received mixed reviews . During the unveiling ceremony , there was reportedly a " momentary stunned silence then crescendo of applause duly recorded by local news media " . In 1970 , one Building Stone News contributor wrote that the sculpture 's flowing white lines contrast with the stark vertical pillars of white quartz on the adjacent building 's exterior , and called the marble " impressive " . In contrast , Tisdale said of the work : 
 The Quest has been around since 1970 , long enough for its provenance and purpose to sink into mystery ... No one seems to like it much , and others actively dislike it . But there it stays , a free sex @-@ education lesson for busloads of suburban schoolchildren , the uncertain limbs forever reaching somewhere or other , for something . 
 The sculpture has earned the nicknames Saturday Night at the Y and Three Groins in a Fountain . One writer for The Seattle Times , in a piece about differences between Portland and Seattle , referenced the latter nickname as an example of Portland 's " <unk> " art . In 2003 , Eugene Weekly published a book review that suggested readers should read Fugitives and Refugees : A Walk in Portland , Oregon , a recently published travelogue by Chuck Palahniuk , if they were unfamiliar with " Three Groins in the Fountain " . Palahniuk includes the sculpture is his " Portland vocabulary lesson " , which includes a list of his definitions for local words . The sculpture has been included in at least one published walking tour of Portland . 
 = USS De Soto ( 1859 ) = 
 USS De Soto was a fast wooden @-@ hulled sidewheel steamship that saw service as a U.S. Navy gunboat during the American Civil War . 
 De Soto was originally a privately owned vessel , built for passenger service between New York and New Orleans . With the outbreak of the Civil War in 1861 , she was purchased by the Navy , commissioned as USS De Soto , and sent to assist with the blockade of Confederate ports . De Soto 's speed made her an effective pursuit ship , and she would capture or bring about the destruction of a total of eighteen blockade runners during the war . 
 In the postwar period , De Soto continued to serve with the Navy , mostly in South American waters , until resold to her original owners in 1868 for resumption of service as a passenger ship . She caught fire and was burned to the waterline in December 1870 . 
 = = Construction and design = = 
 De Soto was built by Lawrence & <unk> of Brooklyn , New York in 1859 for Livingston , <unk> & Co . , which ran a line of passenger steamships between New York and New Orleans . At 1 @,@ 675 tons and 253 feet ( 77 m ) in length , De Soto was quite a large steamer for her time , and considered a fine example of her type . She was named after Hernando De Soto , a Spanish explorer and conquistador . 
 De Soto was powered by a 65 @-@ inch ( 170 cm ) bore , 11 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 4 m ) stroke single @-@ cylinder vertical beam engine , built by the Morgan Iron Works of New York . The engine , which drove a pair of 30 @-@ foot <unk> , was capable of delivering up to 14 mph ( 12 knots ) — a good speed for the time , which would soon make De Soto a favorite with the travelling public and which would later prove invaluable for pursuing blockade runners during the Civil War . The ship had a single , raked smokestack forward of the engine , and two masts , one fore and one aft — the fore mast square rigged — to provide auxiliary sail power . 
 = = Commercial service , 1859 – 61 = = 
 De Soto appears to have entered service in August 1859 , carrying mail , passengers and specie between New York and New Orleans , with an intermediate stop at Havana , Cuba . She would maintain a regular service on this route , making a round trip about once a month , until shortly after the outbreak of the Civil War in April 1861 . 
 The ship made a fast passage of less than four days from Havana to New York in April 1860 , at an average speed of around 14 mph . By this time she had already earned a reputation as a " fast and popular steamship " . Another fast run , again at an average speed of about 14 mph , was made in June following . 
 In addition to her passengers and cargo , De Soto also acted as a conduit for news between Cuba and the United States . Most of the news conveyed by De Soto was of a mundane character — for example , reports of activity on the Havana sugar market — but sometimes it was of more interest . In October 1860 for instance , De Soto reported the interception at Sierra Morena , Cuba of an illegal slave ship carrying 800 African slaves . The captain and crew of the slave ship were detained by local authorities , but about 400 of the slaves had already been dispersed ashore and could not be retrieved . 
 De Soto became one of the last steamships to engage in trade between the North and the breakaway Southern states when she departed New York for New Orleans on 23 April 1861 , eleven days after the outbreak of the Civil War . The Confederacy however missed the opportunity to seize the vessel , and she returned safely to New York . On 6 May , De Soto departed New York for Havana once again , but on this occasion it was " not considered prudent " for the ship to continue on to New Orleans . 
 De Soto made one further voyage to Havana in June . On 21 August 1861 , she was purchased by the U.S. Navy for the sum of $ 161 @,@ 250 for conversion into a gunboat .

 = = = Gulf Blockading Squadron = = = 
 At the New York Navy Yard , De Soto was fitted out for naval service , including the installation of a battery consisting of one 30 @-@ pounder Parrott rifle and eight 32 @-@ pound guns . She was then commissioned as USS De Soto , with Commander William M. Walker placed in command . 
 The steamer put to sea on 19 November with ordnance stores for Fort Pickens , Florida , and vessels in the Gulf of Mexico , arriving off Southwest Pass , Mississippi River , after 11 December . Joining the Gulf Blockading Squadron at that time , De Soto patrolled for Confederate blockade runners near Barataria Bay . Given the sometimes light winds of the Gulf and inshore waters , the vessel 's shallow draft and steam power gave De Soto an advantage over her mainly sail @-@ powered prey . Cmdr. Walker 's first month in the region began poorly , however , when his ship collided with the French war steamer Milan , then adrift off South West Pass , Mississippi River . Although damage to De Soto was slight , the Milan was disabled and thus needed a tow into the Union anchorage . 
 In spite of this initial mishap , De Soto 's first capture did not take long , as she and a <unk> @-@ crewed lugger took schooner Major Barbour off Isles <unk> , Louisiana on 28 January 1862 . Cmdr. Walker 's crew discovered 8 barrels of gunpowder and 198 cases of gunpowder , nitrates , sulfur , and percussion caps in the blockade runner . On 8 February , the steamer caught the small schooner Star out of Bayou Lafourche , taking her four @-@ man crew prisoner . 
 = = = Western Blockading Squadron = = = 
 Upon Rear Admiral David G. Farragut 's arrival at Key West , Florida , in steam sloop @-@ of @-@ war Hartford in late February , the Gulf Blockading Squadron was split into parts , the Eastern and Western Gulf Blockading Squadrons . De Soto came under the command of the Western Blockading Squadron at that time , although she did not change her patrol station at Barataria , Louisiana . As the steamer continued blockade operations through the spring , De Soto also served as a mobile storeship , carrying extra bread and ordnance supplies . She remained there until early July , when she made a quick run up the Mississippi River , carrying letters and passengers to the warships participating in the siege of Vicksburg , Mississippi . Returning down river , De Soto sailed southeast along the coast of Texas , patrolling off Sabine Pass , the Brazos River and Brazos Santiago at the mouth of the Rio Grande . 
 = = = Repair and refit = = = 
 Three months of hot weather and lack of maintenance facilities took a toll on De Soto 's boilers and she returned to New Orleans , Louisiana , for temporary repairs in early October . A backlog of work and lack of funds forced Rear Adm. David Farragut to send De Soto north , however , and the steamer arrived at the Philadelphia Navy Yard only on 18 November . Two months of repair work followed , during which time Cmdr. Walker was promoted to Captain . At this time , De Soto 's battery was also changed , to one 11 @-@ inch ( 280 mm ) Dahlgren , one 30 @-@ pounder Parrot rifle , six 32 @-@ pound rifles and two 12 @-@ pound smoothbores . 
 De Soto stood down the Delaware River on 3 February 1863 and , after stops at Havana , Cuba and Santo Domingo , arrived back at Key West , Florida on the 15th . 
 = = = Eastern Gulf Blockade = = = 
 Assigned to the Eastern Gulf Blockading Squadron under Rear Admiral Theodorus Bailey , De Soto spent March and April fruitlessly cruising for CSS Alabama in the Gulf of Mexico . As one of the few fast steamers in Bailey 's command , De Soto possessed a speed advantage over most of her blockade running prey . This was demonstrated on 24 April , when De Soto sailors boarded and seized two sloops , Jane Adelie and Bright , sixteen hours out of Mobile , Alabama , and each laden with cotton . Two schooners , General Prim and Rapid , were then taken the very next day , and they too carried cotton . All four prizes were sent to Key West for adjudication . On 27 April , De Soto continued the run of good luck , seizing the British schooner Clarita en route from Havana , Cuba to Matamoras . 
 Patrolling north and west of the Tortugas , the warship then captured the schooner Sea Bird on 14 May . Three days later , De Soto pursued the smoke of an unknown steamer and , after an 18 @-@ hour chase , forced her to stop in open water well south of Mobile Bay . Before De Soto 's boats could board , however , the enemy steamer 's crew set fires and abandoned ship , sinking what turned out to be Confederate steamer Cuba beneath the waves . De Soto continued her fast pace of operations the next day , capturing schooner Mississippian on 19 May before finally returning to Key West for repairs . 
 Returning to sea in mid @-@ June , De Soto 's luck held and she captured schooner Lady Maria north of Tampa Bay on 6 July , laden with 104 bales of cotton . On the 18th , while cruising near Mobile Bay , De Soto spotted a steamer and closed and took the steamer James Battle , laden with rosin and cotton . At that point , two screw steamers from the West Gulf Blockading Squadron , Aroostook and Ossipee , closed with some disappointment , as they had been chasing the blockade runner . Later that same evening , as De Soto and Ossipee independently chased a second steamer , Capt. Walker closed and took William Bagley before the other Union ship could do so . Those actions by De Soto , which put Capt. Jonathan P. Gillis of the Ossipee in mind of " a voracious aquatic bird " , led to a dispute over prize claims . The controversy was resolved later in the month when Rear Admiral Bailey and Rear Admiral David G. Farragut , commander of the Western Gulf Blockading Squadron , agreed to split prize shares . 
 De Soto continued her patrols in the Gulf of Mexico into the month of August , braving the sweltering heat to board and inspect coastal and seaborne traffic . The steamer Alice Vivian was seized on 16 August , as she had no papers , and the steamer Nita was taken the next day for the same reason . During this month , wear and tear on the steamer 's boilers began to show and , despite attempts at repair , De Soto steadily lost speed . On 12 September , following a nine @-@ hour chase under steam and sail , the Union ship finally took the blockade runner Montgomery , a chase Capt. Walker claimed should have taken one fourth the time if the boilers were in good order . Tinkering helped build up steam pressure to a point , and De Soto managed to chase down the screw steamer Leviathan on 22 September . 
 Returning to Key West in late October , De Soto received minor repairs and re @-@ coaled . Captain Walker was relieved of command in early November by Captain Gustavus H. Scott , before spending the next six weeks patrolling off Northeast Providence Channel in the Bahamas . After coaling at Key West in early January 1864 , De Soto patrolled off Mobile Bay , where she chased and captured steamer Cumberland on 5 February . The " Anglo @-@ rebel " steamer had loaded arms , ammunition and 100 barrels of gunpowder at Havana in late 1863 and was trying to slip into Mobile when taken . De Soto proceeded to Havana in late February , for dry docking and repairs to her hull , before taking up a patrol station off the east coast of Florida in mid @-@ March . A month later , she was back in Key West for coaling and repairs before returning to her familiar hunting grounds southeast of Mobile Bay . 
 = = = Yellow fever outbreak = = = 
 Sometime in April or May , De Soto 's crew began coming down with yellow fever and the steamer was sent north in early June , arriving at Portsmouth , New Hampshire , on 16 June . As per normal practice , the warship was decommissioned that same day and the crew quarantined until the fever burned out . On 12 January 1865 , De Soto was sent to Baltimore , Maryland for the installation of new boilers . She was still there when the war ended on 9 April 1865 .

 = = = Haiti rebellion = = = 
 At this time , " revolutionists " in Haiti were fighting the government of President <unk> from a base at Cap @-@ Haïtien , and De Soto steamed to that port to safeguard Americans residing in that area . On 19 October , following a confrontation between the rebel steamer Providence and HMS Bulldog , revolutionaries in the port seized refugees out of the British Consulate , which was viewed as a " gross outrage against the British flag . " On 23 October , despite Capt. Walker 's attempts at mediation , HMS Bulldog attacked both the fort guarding the harbor and batteries in town . While so doing , the Royal Navy steamer ran hard aground inside the harbor . She continued to fire , however , and her cannon sank Providence and destroyed many buildings ashore . Being in cold iron , De Soto could not immediately move , but Capt. Walker did send his boats ashore to take off foreigners . A short while later , Captain Wake in HMS Bulldog asked for towing assistance , which Capt. Walker denied , though De Soto 's boats did take off the sick and wounded . Following a boiler explosion , and unable to get off the reef , the British blew up their warship and withdrew from the harbor in their boats . 
 De Soto withdrew the next day as well , carrying the wounded British sailors to Jamaica before putting into Port @-@ au @-@ Prince , to debark the many foreign refugees picked up at Cape <unk> . After consultations with the American Consul , Capt. Walker took De Soto back to Cap @-@ Haïtien on 7 November . There , he negotiated with a British squadron under Captain Macguire in HMS Galatea in the hopes of averting a retaliatory bombardment of the town , particularly as the Americans feared such an act would provoke widespread unrest and attacks on foreigners throughout Haiti . These talks failed and on 9 November , the British squadron bombarded the town in conjunction with an attack by President <unk> 's forces . With the defensive works destroyed and the town falling to government forces , the rebel leaders took refuge on De Soto . Capt. Walker then carried them to Monte Christo in the Dominican Republic . De Soto returned to Cape <unk> to keep an eye on events until 13 December when she sailed for home , arriving in Hampton Roads on 19 December .

 Three days later , De Soto stood up the Chesapeake Bay and the Potomac River to the Washington Navy Yard , where she picked up letters for the West Indies .

She remained there until 19 March when she proceeded down river and into the Bay , reaching Hampton Roads on the 23d . On 10 April the warship was placed under the command of Captain Charles S. Boggs . 
 As the revolutionary disturbances in , and friction between , Haiti and the Dominican Republic continued apace , De Soto returned to the West Indies in June , arriving at Port @-@ au @-@ Prince on the 19th . The steamer also patrolled in the Gulf of Mexico , with an eye on the unsettled conditions in Mexico , where a guerrilla war raged against the French occupation of the country . De Soto remained in the region through the rest of the year before returning to Hampton Roads in the spring of 1867 .

De Soto proceeded south along the Florida coast on 22 October , stopping at Tampa Bay and Key West before arriving at St. Thomas , Virgin Islands , on 17 November . The ship , in company with sidewheel steamer Susquehanna and screw sloop @-@ of @-@ war Monongahela , was there as part of Secretary of State William H. Seward 's plan to purchase the Danish West Indies . The day after De Soto 's arrival , however , a magnitude 7 @.@ 5 earthquake struck the region and a tsunami swept the steamer from her moorings and threw the ship onto a wharf . Luckily , the next wave lifted the ship and carried her back to deep water . With her bottom damaged and leaking badly , De Soto 's sailors and carpenters spent the next ten days pumping water and repairing the hull . On 5 December , the steamer sailed north with the Danish Commissioner on board and the ship arrived at Norfolk , Virginia , on the 17th .

 After completing more substantial repairs over the winter , De Soto sailed to Venezuela on 3 March 1868 , to secure the release of crewmen from the whaling schooner Hannah Grant , who had been captured on the peninsula of <unk> . At Curaçao , Capt. Boggs learned that the crew had already been released , but he remained in Venezuelan waters in support of the American minister during interviews with the Venezuelan vice @-@ president and other officials of the Republic . 
 De Soto steamed to Philadelphia , Pennsylvania on 28 August , and then proceeded to the New York Navy Yard in early September . There she was decommissioned on 11 September 1868 . 
 = = Return to commercial service , 1868 – 70 = = 
 On 30 September 1868 , De Soto was resold to her original owners , now known as Livingston , Fox & Co . After a thorough reconditioning , she was returned to service as a commercial steamship , operating on her old route between New York and New Orleans with a port of call at Havana . She maintained a monthly service on this route for another two years . 
 On 25 December 1870 , De Soto cleared New Orleans for New York but collided with a towboat and was forced to return to dock for repairs . On 31 December , she set out for New York again , with a cargo of 988 bales of cotton , 200 hogsheads of sugar , 1000 barrels of molasses and sundries . After travelling only 27 miles , a fire broke out onboard and the steamer was beached at <unk> Flat , where she burned to the waterline . The ship and cargo , with a combined value of $ 250 @,@ 000 , were deemed " almost a total loss " . 
 = Blagdon Lake = 
 Blagdon Lake lies in a valley at the northern edge of the Mendip Hills , close to the village of Blagdon and approximately 10 miles ( 16 km ) south of Bristol , England . The lake was created by Bristol Water ( Bristol Waterworks Company as it was known then ) , when it dammed the River Yeo , starting construction in 1898 , to designs by Charles Hawksley , and completing this in 1905 . The Wrington Vale Light Railway was constructed primarily to bring building materials for the lake . 
 The reservoir was formed by the construction of a dam and provided water to the pumping station which originally contained four Woolf compound rotative beam pumping engines , built by Glenfield & Kennedy of Kilmarnock , which have now been replaced by electric pumps . Two of the steam engines have been preserved , with one in working order as part of the visitor centre which also includes educational facilities for children . The pumping station is now a Grade II * listed building . 
 The 8 @,@ 456 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 @-@ litre ( 1 @.@ 860 × 109 imp gal ; 2 @.@ 234 × 109 US gal ) lake still provides 9 @,@ 547 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 litres ( 2 @.@ 100 × 109 imp gal ; 2 @.@ 522 × 109 US gal ) of drinking water each year , but also acts as a fishing lake . It provides a habitat for a range of flora and fauna and is a Site of Special Scientific Interest . The original suction tanks , which formed the water supply for the steam boilers powering the pumping engines , are now used for trout rearing . 
 = = Reservoir = = 
 The lake , which was originally called the Yeo reservoir , covers 440 acres ( 180 ha ) . The River Yeo rises in the centre of Compton Martin village , from there it flows past the village of <unk> and enters Blagdon Lake . From the lake the river flows south of Wrington and <unk> , where there were once a series of watermills along its banks . Its route then takes it around the northern outskirts of Congresbury , and across the North Somerset Levels roughly parallel to the A370 road , past the site of a Roman villa before crossing under the M5 motorway and emptying into the Severn Estuary in Woodspring Bay , downstream from Clevedon and west of the village of Kingston Seymour . The watershed catchment area of the reservoir is 2 @,@ 144 hectares ( 5 @,@ 300 acres ) . 
 The construction of the reservoir was approved by acts of parliament in 1888 and 1889 as part of a plan to provide drinking water to Bristol , supplementing Barrow Gurney Reservoirs and the " line of works " pipe which carries water from the Mendip Hills . Construction required the provision of sewers to local villages to avoid contamination of the reservoir . The work was designed by Charles Hawksley . In conjunction with the construction work the Wrington Vale Light Railway was established connecting Blagdon with Congresbury on the Cheddar Valley Line and Yatton on the main Bristol to Exeter Line . In addition to carrying construction materials for the reservoir and pumping station it also provided passenger services . Later the railway was used to bring coal for the pumps . Passenger traffic ceased in 1931 and the line to Blagdon closed completely in 1950 . 
 The lake is relatively shallow , with an average depth of 14 ft ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) and only 42 ft ( 13 m ) at its deepest point near the dam at the west end of the lake . The eastern end is the shallowest where the River Yeo enters . It is a hard water area with high mineral content that is vulnerable to eutrophication in the summer , that can cause algal blooms , with transient water layers . As a result , a research programme has been established to observe and measure the limnology of the lake . When full it contains 8 @,@ 456 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 litres ( 1 @.@ 860 × 109 imp gal ; 2 @.@ 234 × 109 US gal ) and supplies 9 @,@ 547 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 litres ( 2 @.@ 100 × 109 imp gal ; 2 @.@ 522 × 109 US gal ) of water each year . Water can also be taken from its larger neighbour Chew Valley Lake to balance the supply . 
 = = = Dam = = = 
 The dam extends 175 ft ( 53 m ) below ground to the solid rock underlying the valley . It was built of puddled clay with a central concrete core and faced with granite on the lake side . A 24 @-@ inch ( 610 mm ) diameter pipe through the dam leads to the pumping station while a larger one is used to remove silt collecting against the dam . A flow of water is maintained in the River Yeo through a compensation channel and an overflow weir and spillway take flood water downstream . 
 = = Pumping station and Visitor Centre = = 
 Blagdon Pumping Station and Visitor Centre includes science and environment exhibits and hands @-@ on displays as well as a room dedicated to the charity WaterAid . One of the two steam @-@ driven beam engines is still working occasionally . Outside this is space for picnics and a nature trail . 
 When the lake first opened there were four Woolf compound rotative beam pumping engines , housed in two separate buildings . They were built by Glenfield & Kennedy of Kilmarnock between 1900 and 1905 . The engine 's beam is 34 ft ( 10 @.@ 36 m ) long and weighs 17 tons . The flywheel is 20 ft ( 6 @.@ 10 m ) in diameter and weighs 20 tons , having a crank throw of 3 @.@ 5 ft ( 1 @.@ 07 m ) . Each beam engine had an output of 170 horsepower ( 130 kW ) at 17 rpm . The high @-@ pressure cylinders , 21 inches ( 53 @.@ 3 cm ) in diameter and with a 3 @.@ 25 ft ( 0 @.@ 99 m ) stroke , were supplied by steam from horizontal Lancashire @-@ type twin flue boilers with Green 's economisers at 100 pounds per square inch ( 6 @.@ 9 bar ) . The low @-@ pressure cylinder was 34 inches ( 86 @.@ 4 cm ) in diameter and has a 7 ft ( 2 @.@ 13 m ) stroke . Three engines with a fourth on standby could pump water at a rate of 7 @.@ 5 million imperial gallons ( 34 @,@ 000 m3 ) per day , whilst the boilers consumed 8 @.@ 5 tons of coal per day . A mechanical efficiency of 90 % was claimed , the 30 @-@ inch ( 76 @.@ 2 cm ) diameter pump bucket , 3 @.@ 5 ft ( 1 @.@ 07 m ) strike and plunger diameter of 21 inches ( 53 @.@ 34 cm ) gave a pump output of 107 imperial gallons ( 490 l ) per stroke . They ran until 1949 , when two engines from the north engine house were replaced by electric pumps . In 1950 automatic shutdown equipment was installed to prevent damage in the event of a burst main or overloading of the new electric pumps . This meant that it was no longer essential to have staff on site 24 hours a day . The decorative chimney was shortened in the 1960s . In 2014 new split @-@ case vertical pumps and various other new equipment was installed to replace those installed in the 1940s and 1950s . 
 In 1984 it was decided to preserve the two remaining engines and incorporate them as the central feature in the Visitor Centre , including a Museum in the old boiler house , which opened in 1988 and attracts over 30 @,@ 000 visitors a year . The flywheel is now driven by an electric motor . The pumping station is now a Grade II * listed building , while the gothic @-@ style meter house is Grade II listed and used as a bat sanctuary . 
 = = Fishing = = 
 The lake is well known for trout fishing from its banks and the fleet of 18 rowing boats for hire . The suction tanks which originally supplied water to the steam boilers for the pumping engines are now used as rearing pools for the fish before they are transferred into the lake . On average 50 @,@ 000 trout are reared at Blagdon each year by Bristol Water to stock this and surrounding lakes such as Chew Valley Lake and the Barrow Tanks . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 Blagdon Lake is designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest ( SSSI ) of 212 @.@ 7 hectares ( 526 acres ) , created in 1971 , largely because of the variety of species and habitats . The area around the pumping station was laid out as an ornamental woodland which includes Scots pine , Cedar , Larch , Spruce , Oak , Beech , Chestnut , Willow , Lime , Holly and Maple . A variety of orchids including green @-@ winged orchid ( Anacamptis morio ) and southern marsh @-@ orchids can be seen on the borders of the lake . 
 A variety of water birds can be seen around the lake including : great crested grebe ( Podiceps cristatus ) and little grebe ( <unk> ruficollis ) , cormorant ( <unk> ) , mute swan ( Cygnus olor ) , Canada goose ( Branta canadensis ) , duck ( Anatidae ) , shoveller ( Anas clypeata ) and gadwall ( Anas strepera ) . The common buzzard ( Buteo buteo ) can be seen on the surrounding hills and both Eurasian sparrowhawk ( Accipiter nisus ) and kestrel breed . Occasional visitors include : osprey ( " Pandion <unk> " ) , goshawk ( Accipiter gentilis ) , Eurasian hobby ( Falco subbuteo ) , nuthatch and great spotted woodpecker ( <unk> major ) . The ruddy darter dragonfly ( Sympetrum sanguineum ) can also be seen . In the wood at the western end of the lake there are populations of badgers , roe deer ( <unk> capreolus ) and foxes . 
 = Common tern = 
 The common tern ( Sterna hirundo ) is a seabird of the tern family Sternidae . This bird has a circumpolar distribution , its four subspecies breeding in temperate and subarctic regions of Europe , Asia and North America . It is strongly migratory , wintering in coastal tropical and subtropical regions . Breeding adults have light grey upperparts , white to very light grey underparts , a black cap , orange @-@ red legs , and a narrow pointed bill . Depending on the subspecies , the bill may be mostly red with a black tip or all black . There are a number of similar species , including the partly sympatric Arctic tern , which can be separated on plumage details , leg and bill colour , or vocalisations . 
 Breeding in a wider range of habitats than any of its relatives , the common tern nests on any flat , poorly vegetated surface close to water , including beaches and islands , and it readily adapts to artificial substrates such as floating rafts . The nest may be a bare scrape in sand or gravel , but it is often lined or edged with whatever debris is available . Up to three eggs may be laid , their dull colours and blotchy patterns providing camouflage on the open beach . Incubation is by both sexes , and the eggs hatch in around 21 – 22 days , longer if the colony is disturbed by predators . The downy chicks fledge in 22 – 28 days . Like most terns , this species feeds by plunge @-@ diving for fish , either in the sea or in freshwater , but molluscs , crustaceans and other invertebrate prey may form a significant part of the diet in some areas . 
 Eggs and young are vulnerable to predation by mammals such as rats and American mink , and large birds including gulls , owls and herons . Common terns may be infected by lice , parasitic worms , and mites , although blood parasites appear to be rare . Its large population and huge breeding range mean that this species is classed as being of least concern , although numbers in North America have declined sharply in recent decades . Despite international legislation protecting the common tern , in some areas populations are threatened by habitat loss , pollution or the disturbance of breeding colonies . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The terns , family Sternidae , are small to medium @-@ sized seabirds closely related to the gulls , skimmers and skuas . They are gull @-@ like in appearance , but typically have a lighter build , long pointed wings ( which give them a fast , buoyant flight ) , a deeply forked tail , slender legs , and webbed feet . Most species are grey above and white below , and have a black cap which is reduced or flecked with white in the non @-@ breeding season . 
 The common tern 's closest relatives appear to be the Antarctic tern , followed by the Eurasian Arctic and roseate terns . Genetic evidence suggests that the common tern may have diverged from an ancestral stock earlier than its relatives . No fossils are known from North America , and those claimed in Europe are of uncertain age and species . 
 The common tern was first described by Linnaeus in his Systema Naturae in 1758 under its current scientific name , Sterna hirundo . The word " stearn " was used in Old English and a similar word was used by the Frisians for tern . " Stearn " appears in the poem The Seafarer , written around 1000 AD . Linnaeus adopted this word for the genus name Sterna . The Latin for swallow is " hirundo " and refers here to the tern 's superficial likeness to that unrelated bird , which has a similar light build and long forked tail . This resemblance also leads to the informal name " sea swallow " , recorded from at least the seventeenth century . The Scots names <unk> , <unk> and their many variants are also believed to be onomatopoeic , derived from the distinctive call . Due to the difficulty in distinguishing the two species , all the informal common names are shared with the Arctic tern . 
 Four subspecies of the common tern are generally recognized , although S. h. <unk> is sometimes considered to be an intergrade between S. h. hirundo and S. h. longipennis . 
 = = Description = = 
 The nominate subspecies of the common tern is 31 – 35 cm ( 12 – 14 in ) long , including a 6 – 9 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 – 3 @.@ 5 in ) fork in the tail , with a 77 – 98 cm ( 30 – 39 in ) wingspan . It weighs 110 – 141 g ( 3 @.@ 9 – 5 @.@ 0 oz ) . Breeding adults have pale grey upperparts , very pale grey underparts , a black cap , orange @-@ red legs , and a narrow pointed bill that can be mostly red with a black tip , or all black , depending on the subspecies . The common tern 's upperwings are pale grey , but as the summer wears on , the dark feather shafts of the outer flight feathers become exposed , and a grey wedge appears on the wings . The rump and tail are white , and on a standing bird the long tail extends no further than the folded wingtips , unlike the Arctic and roseate terns in which the tail protrudes beyond the wings . There are no significant differences between the sexes . In non @-@ breeding adults the forehead and underparts become white , the bill is all black or black with a red base , and the legs are dark red or black . The upperwings have an obvious dark area at the front edge of the wing , the carpal bar . Terns that have not bred successfully may start moulting into non @-@ breeding adult plumage from June , but late July is more typical , with the moult suspended during migration . There is also some geographical variation , Californian birds often being in non @-@ breeding plumage during migration . 
 Juvenile common terns have pale grey upperwings with a dark carpal bar . The crown and nape are brown , and the forehead is ginger , wearing to white by autumn . The upperparts are ginger with brown and white scaling , and the tail lacks the adult 's long outer feathers . Birds in their first post @-@ juvenile plumage , which normally remain in their wintering areas , resemble the non @-@ breeding adult , but have a duskier crown , dark carpal bar , and often very worn plumage . By their second year , most young terns are either indistinguishable from adults , or show only minor differences such as a darker bill or white forehead . 
 The common tern is an agile flyer , capable of rapid turns and swoops , hovering , and vertical take @-@ off . When commuting with fish , it flies close to the surface in a strong head wind , but 10 – 30 m ( 33 – 98 ft ) above the water in a following wind . Unless migrating , normally it stays below 100 m ( 330 ft ) , and averages 30 km / h ( 19 mph ) in the absence of a tail wind . Its average flight speed during the nocturnal migration flight is 43 – 54 km / h ( 27 – 34 mph ) at a height of 1 @,@ 000 – 3 @,@ 000 m ( 3 @,@ 300 – 9 @,@ 800 ft ) . 
 = = = Moult = = = 
 The juvenile starts moulting into adult plumage in its first October ; the head , tail and body plumage is replaced first , mostly by February , then the wing feathers . The primaries are replaced in stages ; the innermost feathers moult first , then replacement is suspended during the southern winter ( birds of this age staying in their wintering areas ) and <unk> in the autumn . In May to June of the second year a similar moult sequence starts , with a pause during primary moult for birds that return north , but not for those that stay in the winter quarters . A major moult to adult breeding plumage occurs in the next February to June , between 40 – 90 % of feathers being replaced . Old primary feathers wear away to reveal the blackish barbs beneath . The moult pattern means that the oldest feathers are those nearest the middle of the wing , so as the northern summer progresses , a dark wedge appears on the wing due to this feather ageing process . 
 Terns are unusual in the frequency in which they moult their primaries , which are replaced at least twice , occasionally three times in a year . The visible difference in feather age is accentuated in the greater ultraviolet reflectance of new primaries , and the freshness of the wing feathers is used by females in mate selection . Experienced females tend to accept mates which best show their fitness through the quality of their wing feathers . Rarely , a very early moult at the nesting colony may be linked to breeding failure , both the onset of moult and reproductive behaviour being linked to falling levels of the hormone prolactin . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 There are several terns of a similar size and general appearance to the common tern . A traditionally difficult species to separate is the Arctic tern , and until the key characteristics were clarified , distant or flying birds of the two species were often jointly recorded as " <unk> terns " . Although similar in size , the two terns differ in structure and flight . The common tern has a larger head , thicker neck , longer legs , and more triangular and stiffer wings than its relative , and has a more powerful , direct flight . The Arctic tern has greyer underparts than the common , which make its white cheeks more obvious , whereas the rump of the common tern can be greyish in non @-@ breeding plumage , compared to the white of its relative . The common tern develops a dark wedge on the wings as the breeding season progresses , but the wings of Arctic stay white throughout the northern summer . All the flight feathers of the Arctic tern are translucent against a bright sky , only the four innermost wing feathers of the common tern share this property . The trailing edge of the outer flight feathers is a thin black line in the Arctic tern , but thicker and less defined in the common . The bill of an adult common tern is orange @-@ red with a black tip , except in black @-@ billed S. h. longipennis , and its legs are bright red , while both features are a darker red colour in the Arctic tern , which also lacks the black bill tip . 
 In the breeding areas , the roseate tern can be distinguished by its pale plumage , long , mainly black bill and very long tail feathers . The non @-@ breeding plumage of roseate is pale above and white , sometimes pink @-@ tinged , below . It retains the long tail streamers , and has a black bill . In flight , the roseate 's heavier head and neck , long bill and faster , stiffer wingbeats are also characteristic . It feeds further out to sea than the common tern . In North America , the Forster 's tern in breeding plumage is obviously larger than the common , with relatively short wings , a heavy head and thick bill , and long , strong legs ; in all non @-@ breeding plumages , its white head and dark eye patch make the American species unmistakable . 
 In the wintering regions , there are also confusion species , including the Antarctic tern of the southern oceans , the South American tern , the Australasian white @-@ fronted tern and the white @-@ cheeked tern of the Indian Ocean . Identification may be aided by the plumage differences due to " opposite " breeding seasons . The Antarctic tern is more sturdy than the common , with a heavier bill . In breeding condition , its dusky underparts and full black cap outline a white cheek stripe . In non @-@ breeding plumages , it lacks , or has only an indistinct , carpal bar , and young birds show dark bars on the tertials , obvious on the closed wing and in flight . The South American tern is larger than the common , with a larger , more curved red bill , and has a smoother , more extensive black cap in non @-@ breeding plumage . Like Antarctic , it lacks a strong carpal bar in non @-@ breeding plumages , and it also shares the distinctive barring of the tertials in young birds . The white @-@ fronted tern has a white forehead in breeding plumage , a heavier bill , and in non @-@ breeding plumage is paler below than the common , with white underwings . The white @-@ cheeked tern is smaller , has uniform grey upperparts , and in breeding <unk> is darker above with whiter cheeks . 
 Juvenile common terns are easily separated from similar @-@ aged birds of related species . They show extensive ginger colouration to the back , and have a pale base to the bill . Young Arctic terns have a grey back and black bill , and juvenile roseate terns have a distinctive scalloped " saddle " . Hybrids between common and roseate terns have been recorded , particularly from the US , and the intermediate plumage and calls shown by these birds is a potential identification pitfall . Such birds may have more extensive black on the bill , but confirmation of mixed breeding may depend on the exact details of individual flight feathers . 
 = = = Voice = = = 
 The common tern has a wide repertoire of calls , which have a lower pitch than the equivalent calls of Arctic terns . The most distinctive sound is the alarm KEE @-@ yah , stressed on the first syllable , in contrast to the second @-@ syllable stress of the Arctic tern . The alarm call doubles up as a warning to intruders , although serious threats evoke a <unk> , given as a tern takes flight , and <unk> the usually noisy colony while its residents assess the danger . A down @-@ slurred <unk> is given when an adult is approaching the nest while carrying a fish , and is possibly used for individual recognition ( chicks emerge from hiding when they hear their parents giving this call ) . Another common call is a kip uttered during social contact . Other vocalizations include a <unk> when attacking intruders , and a staccato kek @-@ kek @-@ kek from fighting males . 
 Parents and chicks can locate one another by call , and siblings also recognise each other 's vocalisations from about the twelfth day from hatching , which helps to keep the brood together . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Most populations of the common tern are strongly migratory , wintering south of their temperate and subarctic Northern Hemisphere breeding ranges . First summer birds usually remain in their wintering quarters , although a few return to breeding colonies some time after the arrival of the adults . In North America , the common tern breeds along the Atlantic coast from Labrador to North Carolina , and inland throughout much of Canada east of the Rocky Mountains . In the United States , some breeding populations can also be found in the states bordering the Great Lakes , and locally on the Gulf coast . There are small , only partially migratory , colonies in the Caribbean ; these are in The Bahamas and Cuba , and off Venezuela in the Los Roques and Las Aves archipelagos . 
 New World birds winter along both coasts of Central and South America , to Argentina on the east coast and to Northern Chile on the west coast . Records from South America and the Azores show that some birds may cross the Atlantic in both directions on their migration . 
 The common tern breeds across most of Europe , with the highest numbers in the north and east of the continent . There are small populations on the north African coast , and in the Azores , Canary Islands and Madeira . Most winter off western or southern Africa , birds from the south and west of Europe tending to stay north of the equator and other European birds moving further south . The breeding range continues across the temperate and taiga zones of Asia , with scattered outposts on the Persian Gulf and the coast of Iran . Small populations breed on islands off Sri Lanka , and in the Ladakh region of the Tibetan plateau . Western Asian birds winter in the northern Indian Ocean , and S. h. <unk> appears to be common off East Africa during the northern hemisphere winter . Birds from further north and east in Asia , such as S. h. longipennis , move through Japan , Thailand and the western Pacific as far as southern Australia . There are small and erratic colonies in West Africa , in Nigeria and Guinea @-@ Bissau , unusual in that they are within what is mainly a wintering area . Only a few common terns have been recorded in New Zealand , and this species ' status in Polynesia is unclear . A bird ringed at the nest in Sweden was found dead on Stewart Island , New Zealand , five months later , having flown an estimated 25 @,@ 000 km ( 15 @,@ 000 mi ) . 
 As long distance migrants , common terns sometimes occur well outside their normal range . Stray birds have been found inland in Africa ( Zambia and Malawi ) , and on the Maldives and Comoros islands ; the nominate subspecies has reached Australia , the Andes , and the interior of South America . Asian S. h. longipennis has recent records from western Europe . 
 The common tern breeds over a wider range of habitats than any of its relatives , nesting from the taiga of Asia to tropical shores , and at altitudes up to 2 @,@ 000 m ( 6 @,@ 600 ft ) in Armenia , and 4 @,@ 800 m ( 15 @,@ 700 ft ) in Asia . It avoids areas which are frequently exposed to excessive rain or wind , and also icy waters , so it does not breed as far north as the Arctic tern . The common tern breeds close to freshwater or the sea on almost any open flat habitat , including sand or shingle beaches , firm dune areas , salt marsh , or , most commonly , islands . Flat grassland or heath , or even large flat rocks may be suitable in an island environment . In mixed colonies , common terns will tolerate somewhat longer ground vegetation than Arctic terns , but avoid the even taller growth acceptable to roseate terns ; the relevant factor here is the different leg lengths of the three species . Common terns adapt readily to artificial floating rafts , and may even nest on flat factory roofs . Unusual nest sites include hay bales , a stump 0 @.@ 6 m ( 2 @.@ 0 ft ) above the water , and floating logs or vegetation . There is a record of a common tern taking over a spotted sandpiper nest and laying its eggs with those of the wader . Outside the breeding season , all that is needed in terms of habitat is access to fishing areas , and somewhere to land . In addition to natural beaches and rocks , boats , buoys and piers are often used both as perches and night @-@ time roosts . 
 = = Behaviour = = 
 = = = Territory = = = 
 The common tern breeds in colonies which do not normally exceed 2 @,@ 000 pairs , but may occasionally number more than 20 @,@ 000 pairs . Colonies inland tend to be smaller than on the coast . Common terns often nest alongside other coastal species , such as Arctic , roseate and Sandwich terns , black @-@ headed gulls , and black skimmers . Especially in the early part of the breeding season , for no known reason , most or all of the terns will fly in silence low and fast out to sea . This phenomenon is called a " dread " . 
 On their return to the breeding sites , the terns may loiter for a few days before settling into a territory , and the actual start of nesting may be linked to a high availability of fish . Terns defend only a small area , with distances between nests sometimes being as little as 50 cm ( 20 in ) , although 150 – 350 cm ( 59 – 138 in ) is more typical . As with many birds , the same site is re @-@ used year after year , with a record of one pair returning for 17 successive breeding seasons . Around 90 % of experienced birds reuse their former territory , so young birds must nest on the periphery , find a bereaved mate , or move to another colony . A male selects a nesting territory a few days after his arrival in the spring , and is joined by his previous partner unless she is more than five days late , in which case the pair may separate . 
 The defence of the territory is mainly by the male , who repels intruders of either sex . He gives an alarm call , opens his wings , raises his tail and bows his head to show the black cap . If the intruder persists , the male stops calling and fights by bill grappling until the intruder submits by raising its head to expose the throat . Aerial trespassers are simply attacked , sometimes following a joint upward spiralling flight . Despite the aggression shown to adults , wandering chicks are usually tolerated , whereas in a gull colony they would be attacked and killed . The nest is defended until the chicks have fledged , and all the adults in the colony will collectively repel potential predators . 
 = = = Breeding = = = 
 Pairs are established or confirmed through aerial courtship displays in which a male and a female fly in wide circles up to 200 m ( 660 ft ) or more , calling all the while , before the two birds descend together in zigzag glides . If the male is carrying a fish , he may attract the attention of other males too . On the ground , the male courts the female by circling her with his tail and neck raised , head pointing down , and wings partially open . If she responds , they may both adopt a posture with the head pointed skywards . The male may tease a female with the fish , not parting with his offering until she has displayed to him sufficiently . Once courtship is complete , the male makes a shallow depression in the sand , and the female scratches in the same place . Several trials may take place until the pair settle on a site for the actual nest . The eggs may be laid on bare sand , gravel or soil , but a lining of debris or vegetation is often added if available , or the nest may be rimmed with seaweed , stones or shells . The saucer @-@ shaped scrape is typically 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) deep and 10 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) across , but may extend to as much as 24 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) wide including the surrounding decorative material . Breeding success in areas prone to flooding has been enhanced by the provision of artificial mats made from eelgrass , which encourage the terns to nest in higher , less vulnerable areas , since many prefer the mats to bare sand . The common tern tends to use more nest material than roseate or Arctic terns , although roseate often nests in areas with more growing vegetation . 
 Terns are expert at locating their nests in a large colony . Studies show that terns can find and excavate their eggs when they are buried , even if the nest material is removed and the sand smoothed over . They will find a nest placed 5 m ( 16 ft ) from its original site , or even further if it is moved in several stages . Eggs are accepted if reshaped with plasticine or coloured yellow ( but not red or blue ) . This ability to locate the eggs is an adaptation to life in an unstable , wind @-@ blown and tidal environment . 
 The peak time for egg production is early May , with some birds , particularly first @-@ time breeders , laying later in the month or in June . The clutch size is normally three eggs ; larger clutches probably result from two females laying in the same nest . Egg size averages 41 mm × 31 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in × 1 @.@ 2 in ) , although each successive egg in a clutch is slightly smaller than the first laid . The average egg weight is 20 @.@ 2 g ( 0 @.@ 71 oz ) , of which 5 % is shell . The egg weight depends on how well @-@ fed the female is , as well as on its position in the clutch . The eggs are cream , buff , or pale brown , marked with streaks , spots or blotches of black , brown or grey which help to camouflage them . Incubation is by both sexes , although more often by the female , and lasts 21 – 22 days , extending to 25 days if there are frequent disturbances at the colony which cause the adults to leave the eggs unattended ; nocturnal predation may lead to incubation taking up to 34 days . On hot days the incubating parent may fly to water to wet its belly feathers before returning to the eggs , thus affording the eggs some cooling . Except when the colony suffers disaster , 90 % of the eggs hatch . The precocial downy chick is yellowish with black or brown markings , and like the eggs , is similar to the equivalent stage of the Arctic tern . The chicks fledge in 22 – 28 days , usually 25 – 26 . Fledged juveniles are fed at the nest for about five days , and then accompany the adults on fishing expeditions . The young birds may receive supplementary feeds from the parents until the end of the breeding season , and beyond . Common terns have been recorded feeding their offspring on migration and in the wintering grounds , at least until the adults move further south in about December . 
 Like many terns , this species is very defensive of its nest and young , and will harass humans , dogs , muskrats and most diurnal birds , but unlike the more aggressive Arctic tern , it rarely hits the intruder , usually swerving off at the last moment . Adults can discriminate between individual humans , attacking familiar people more intensely than strangers . Nocturnal predators do not elicit similar attacks ; colonies can be wiped out by rats , and adults desert the colony for up to eight hours when great horned owls are present . 
 Common terns usually breed once a year . Second clutches are possible if the first is lost . Rarely , a second clutch may be laid and incubated while some chicks from the first clutch are still being fed . The first breeding attempt is usually at four years of age , sometimes at three years . The average number of young per pair surviving to fledging can vary from zero in the event of the colony being flooded to over 2 @.@ 5 in a good year . In North America , productivity was between 1 @.@ 0 and 2 @.@ 0 on islands , but less than 1 @.@ 0 at coastal and inland sites . Birds become more successful at raising chicks with age . This continues throughout their breeding lives , but the biggest increase is in the first five years . The maximum documented lifespan in the wild is 23 years in North America and 33 years in Europe , but 12 years is a more typical lifespan . 
 = = = Food and feeding = = = 
 Like all Sterna terns , the common tern feeds by plunge @-@ diving for fish , from a height of 1 – 6 m ( 3 @.@ 3 – 19 @.@ 7 ft ) , either in the sea or in freshwater lakes and large rivers . The bird may submerge for a second or so , but to no more than 50 cm ( 20 in ) below the surface . When seeking fish , this tern flies head @-@ down and with its bill held vertically . It may circle or hover before diving , and then plunges directly into the water , whereas the Arctic tern favours a " stepped @-@ hover " technique , and the roseate tern dives at speed from a greater height , and submerges for longer . The common tern typically forages up to 5 – 10 km ( 3 @.@ 1 – 6 @.@ 2 mi ) away from the breeding colony , sometimes as far as 15 km ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) . It will follow schools of fish , and its west African migration route is affected by the location of huge shoals of sardines off the coast of Ghana ; it will also track groups of predatory fish or dolphins , waiting for their prey to be driven to the sea 's surface . Terns often feed in flocks , especially if food is plentiful , and the fishing success rate in a flock is typically about one @-@ third higher than for individuals . 
 Terns have red oil droplets in the cone cells of the retinas of their eyes . This improves contrast and sharpens distance vision , especially in hazy conditions . Birds that have to see through an air / water interface , such as terns and gulls , have more strongly coloured carotenoid pigments in the cone oil drops than other avian species . The improved eyesight helps terns to locate shoals of fish , although it is uncertain whether they are sighting the phytoplankton on which the fish feed , or observing other terns diving for food . Tern 's eyes are not particularly ultraviolet sensitive , an adaptation more suited to terrestrial feeders like the gulls . 
 The common tern preferentially hunts fish 5 – 15 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 – 5 @.@ 9 in ) long . The species caught depend on what is available , but if there is a choice , terns feeding several chicks will take larger prey than those with smaller broods . The proportion of fish fed to chicks may be as high as 95 % in some areas , but invertebrate prey may form a significant part of the diet elsewhere . This may include worms , leeches , molluscs such as small squid , and crustaceans ( prawns , shrimp and mole crabs ) . In freshwater areas , large insects may be caught , such as beetles , cockchafers and moths . Adult insects may be caught in the air , and larvae picked from the ground or from the water surface . Prey is caught in the bill and either swallowed head @-@ first , or carried back to the chicks . Occasionally , two or more small fish may be carried simultaneously . When adults take food back to the nest , they recognise their young by call , rather than visual identification . 
 The common tern may attempt to steal fish from Arctic terns , but might itself be harassed by <unk> skuas , laughing gulls , roseate terns , or by other common terns while bringing fish back to its nest . In one study , two males whose mates had died spent much time stealing food from neighbouring broods . 
 Terns normally drink in flight , usually taking seawater in preference to freshwater , if both are available . Chicks do not drink before fledging , <unk> water , and , like adults , excreting excess salt in a concentrated solution from a specialised nasal gland . Fish bones and the hard exoskeletons of crustaceans or insects are regurgitated as pellets . Adults fly off the nest to defecate , and even small chicks walk a short distance from the scrape to deposit their faeces . Adults attacking animals or humans will often defecate as they dive , often successfully fouling the intruder . 
 = = Predators and parasites = = 
 Rats will take tern eggs , and may even store large numbers in caches , and the American mink is an important predator of hatched chicks , both in North America , and in Scotland where it has been introduced . The red fox can also be a local problem . Because common terns nest on islands , the most common predators are normally other birds rather than mammals . The ruddy turnstone will take eggs from unattended nests , and gulls may take chicks . Great horned owls and short @-@ eared owls will kill both adults and chicks , and black @-@ crowned night herons will also eat small chicks . Merlins and peregrine falcons may attack flying terns ; as with other birds , it seems likely that one advantage of flocking behaviour is to confuse fast @-@ flying predators . 
 The common tern hosts feather lice , which are quite different from those found in Arctic terns , despite the close relationship of the two birds . It may also be infected by parasitic worms , such as the widespread Diphyllobothrium species , the duck parasite <unk> intestinalis , and <unk> species carried initially by fish . Tapeworms of the family <unk> may also infect this species . The mite <unk> <unk> has been found in common terns from Italy , North America and China . A study of 75 breeding common terns found that none carried blood parasites . Colonies have been affected by avian cholera and <unk> , and it is possible that the common tern may be threatened in the future by outbreaks of avian influenza to which it is susceptible . In 1961 the common tern was the first wild bird species identified as infected with avian influenza , the <unk> variant being found in an outbreak of South African birds . 
 = = Status = = 
 The common tern is classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List . It has a large population of 1 @,@ 600 @,@ 000 – 4 @,@ 600 @,@ 000 mature individuals and a huge breeding range estimated at 29 @,@ 200 @,@ 000 km2 ( 11 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 sq mi ) . Breeding numbers have been estimated at 250 @,@ 000 – 500 @,@ 000 pairs , the majority breeding in Asia . Up to 140 @,@ 000 pairs breed in Europe . Fewer than 80 @,@ 000 pairs breed in North America , with most breeding on the northeast Atlantic coast and a declining population of less than 10 @,@ 000 pairs breeding in the Great Lakes region . 
 In the nineteenth century , the use of tern feathers and wings in the millinery trade was the main cause of large reductions in common tern populations in both Europe and North America , especially on the Atlantic coasts and inland . Sometimes entire stuffed birds were used to make hats . Numbers largely recovered early in the twentieth century mainly due to legislation and the work of conservation organizations . Although some Eurasian populations are stable , numbers in North America have fallen by more than 70 % in the last 40 years , and there is an overall negative trend in the global estimates for this species . 
 Threats come from habitat loss through building , pollution or vegetation growth , or disturbance of breeding birds by humans , vehicles , boats or dogs . Local natural flooding may lead to nest losses , and some colonies are vulnerable to predation by rats and large gulls . Gulls also compete with terns for nest sites . Some birds are hunted in the Caribbean for commercial sale as food . Breeding success may be enhanced by the use of floating nest rafts , man @-@ made islands or other artificial nest sites , and by preventing human disturbance . Overgrown vegetation may be burned to clear the ground , and gulls can be killed or discouraged by deliberate disturbance . Contamination with polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) resulted in enhanced levels of <unk> in male embryos , which seemed to disappear prior to fledging , with no effect on colony productivity , but <unk> ( DDE ) , which results from the breakdown of DDT , led to very low levels of successful breeding in some US locations . 
 The common tern is one of the species to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African @-@ Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds ( AEWA ) and the US @-@ Canada Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918 apply . Parties to the <unk> agreement are required to engage in a wide range of conservation strategies described in a detailed action plan . The plan is intended to address key issues such as species and habitat conservation , management of human activities , research , education , and implementation . The North American legislation is similar , although there is a greater emphasis on protection . 
 = Wighard = 
 Wighard ( or Wigheard ; died between 664 and 667 ) was a medieval Archbishop @-@ elect of Canterbury . What little is known about him comes from 8th @-@ century writer Bede , but inconsistencies between various works have led to confusion about the exact circumstances of Wighard 's election and whether he was ever confirmed in that office . What is clear is that he died in Rome after travelling there for confirmation by the papacy of his elevation to the archbishopric . His death allowed Pope Vitalian to select the next archbishop from amongst the clergy in Rome . 
 = = Life = = 
 Wighard was a Saxon priest during the late 7th century , and a native of Kent . He served in the household of Archbishop Deusdedit of Canterbury , and was also a priest at Canterbury . The 8th @-@ century writer Bede says that Wighard was selected to be Archbishop of Canterbury , and that he was sent to Rome to visit Pope Vitalian for confirmation and to receive his pallium . How exactly he was selected , and when that occurred , is open to debate , as Bede himself had two different stories . The first one , related in his Historia Abbatum , stated that Wighard was selected by King Ecgberht of Kent . Fifteen years after Bede 's completion of the Historia Abbatum , Bede wrote the Historia Ecclesiastica Gentis Anglorum , which states that Wighard was selected by Oswiu of Northumbria and Ecgberht with the consent of all the clergy and people . Some modern historians have followed Bede 's second account , but others feel that only Ecgberht selected Wighard . 
 The case for excluding Oswiu from any role in Wighard 's election is based on the theory that Bede misinterpreted a letter from Vitalian to Oswiu as stating that Oswiu was involved in the selection . The historian Nicholas Brooks points out that although Bede may have indeed misread Vitalian 's letter , Oswiu had other reasons for involving himself in Deusdedit 's replacement , not least of which was a concern that the exiled Northumbrian bishop Wilfrid , who was in Kent and Mercia at the time , not be selected as the new archbishop . The historian D. P. Kirby sees Oswiu 's involvement in Wighard 's selection as an attempt to help restore the Anglo @-@ Saxon church , and perhaps as the beginning of steps to secure York as an archbishopric . Brooks points out that one reason Wighard might have journeyed to Rome was to receive his pallium . As it had been the normal practice up until then to have it sent out to England by the papacy , Wighard 's travel to Rome would indicate the papacy 's approval of his election and ensure the validity of his consecration . 
 Bede , who is the main source for this information , is unclear on his chronology relating to Wighard . At one point in the Historia Ecclesiastica , he states that Canterbury had been vacant for some time before Wighard 's election , but in other writings he implies that Wighard was appointed soon after the conclusion of the Council of Whitby , which likely took place in 664 . However Wighard was selected , he died in Rome . His death possibly occurred around 664 , but could have been as late as 667 . It may have been caused by the bubonic plague , or perhaps was due to some other disease epidemic . Like much else in his life , it is unclear if he was actually consecrated before his death . The Oxford Dictionary of National Biography entry for Wighard states that he died before consecration . The historian Peter Blair , however , states that Wighard died as he was about to head home to Canterbury , after his consecration . 
 Pope Vitalian wrote to Oswiu after Wighard 's death , and this letter is preserved by Bede in his Historia Ecclesiastica . In the letter , which also mentions that a messenger from Oswiu had been among the companions of the archbishop @-@ elect , the pope apologises that he has been unable to find a successor to Wighard yet . Wighard 's death in Rome allowed Vitalian the opportunity to choose his successor , and Vitalian chose his friend Theodore of Tarsus to become the next archbishop . 
 = Calutron = 
 A calutron is a mass spectrometer originally designed and used for separating the isotopes of uranium . It was developed by Ernest O. Lawrence during the Manhattan Project and was based on his earlier invention , the cyclotron . Its name was derived from California University Cyclotron , in tribute to Lawrence 's institution , the University of California , where it was invented . <unk> were used in the industrial @-@ scale Y @-@ 12 uranium enrichment plant at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge , Tennessee . The uranium @-@ 235 produced there was used in the Little Boy atomic bomb that was detonated over Hiroshima on 6 August 1945 . 
 The calutron is a type of sector mass spectrometer , an instrument in which a sample is ionized and then accelerated by electric fields and deflected by magnetic fields . The ions ultimately collide with a plate and produce a measurable electric current . Since the ions of the different isotopes have the same electric charge but different masses , the heavier isotopes are deflected less by the magnetic field , causing the beam of particles to separate out into several beams by mass , striking the plate at different locations . The mass of the ions can be calculated according to the strength of the field and the charge of the ions . During World War II , calutrons were developed to use this principle to obtain substantial quantities of high @-@ purity uranium @-@ 235 , by taking advantage of the small mass difference between uranium isotopes . 
 Electromagnetic separation for uranium enrichment was abandoned in the post @-@ war period in favor of the more complicated , but more efficient , gaseous diffusion method . Although most of the calutrons of the Manhattan Project were dismantled at the end of the war , some remained in use to produce isotopically enriched samples of naturally occurring elements for military , scientific and medical purposes . 
 = = Origins = = 
 News of the discovery of nuclear fission by German chemists Otto Hahn and Fritz Strassmann in 1938 , and its theoretical explanation by Lise Meitner and Otto Frisch , was brought to the United States by Niels Bohr . Based on his liquid drop model of the nucleus , he theorized that it was the uranium @-@ 235 isotope and not the more abundant uranium @-@ 238 that was primarily responsible for fission with thermal neutrons . To verify this Alfred O. C. Nier at the University of Minnesota used a mass spectrometer to create a microscopic amount of enriched uranium @-@ 235 in April 1940 . John R. Dunning , Aristid von Grosse and Eugene T. Booth were then able to confirm that Bohr was correct . Leo Szilard and Walter Zinn soon confirmed that more than one neutron was released per fission , which made it almost certain that a nuclear chain reaction could be initiated , and therefore that the development of an atomic bomb was a theoretical possibility . There were fears that a German atomic bomb project would develop one first , especially among scientists who were refugees from Nazi Germany and other fascist countries . 
 At the University of Birmingham in Britain , the Australian physicist Mark Oliphant assigned two refugee physicists — Otto Frisch and Rudolf Peierls — the task of investigating the feasibility of an atomic bomb , ironically because their status as enemy aliens precluded their working on secret projects like radar . Their March 1940 Frisch – Peierls memorandum indicated that the critical mass of uranium @-@ 235 was within an order of magnitude of 10 kg , which was small enough to be carried by a bomber of the day . The British Maud Committee then unanimously recommended pursuing the development of an atomic bomb . Britain had offered to give the United States access to its scientific research , so the Tizard Mission 's John Cockcroft briefed American scientists on British developments . He discovered that the American project was smaller than the British , and not as far advanced . 
 A disappointed Oliphant flew to the United States to speak to the American scientists . These included Ernest O. Lawrence at the University of California 's Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley . The two men had met before the war , and were friends . Lawrence was sufficiently impressed to commence his own research into uranium . Uranium @-@ 235 makes up only about 0 @.@ 72 % of natural uranium , so the separation factor of any uranium enrichment process needs to be higher than 1250 to produce 90 % uranium @-@ 235 from natural uranium . The Maud Committee had recommended that this be done by a process of gaseous diffusion , but Oliphant had pioneered another technique in 1934 : electromagnetic separation . This was the process that Nier had used . 
 The principle of electromagnetic separation was that charged ions are deflected by a magnetic field , and lighter ones are deflected more than heavy ones . The reason the Maud Committee , and later its American counterpart , the S @-@ 1 Uranium Committee , had passed over the electromagnetic method was that while the mass spectrometer was capable of separating isotopes , it produced very low yields . The reason for this was the so @-@ called space @-@ charge limitation . Positive ions have positive charge , so they tend to repel each other , which causes the beam to scatter . Drawing on his experience with the precise control of charged @-@ particle beams from his work with his invention , the cyclotron , Lawrence suspected that the air molecules in the vacuum chamber would neutralize the ions , and create a focused beam . Oliphant inspired Lawrence to convert his old 37 @-@ inch ( 94 cm ) cyclotron into a giant mass spectrometer for isotope separation . 
 The 37 @-@ inch cyclotron at Berkeley was dismantled on 24 November 1941 , and its magnet used to create the first calutron . Its name came from California University and cyclotron . The work was initially funded by the Radiation Laboratory from its own resources , with a $ 5 @,@ 000 grant from the Research Corporation . In December Lawrence received a $ 400 @,@ 000 grant from the S @-@ 1 Uranium Committee . The calutron consisted of an ion source , in the form of a box with a slit in it and hot filaments inside . Uranium tetrachloride was ionized by the filament , and then passed through a 0 @.@ 04 @-@ by @-@ 2 @-@ inch ( 1 @.@ 0 by 50 @.@ 8 mm ) slot into a vacuum chamber . The magnet is then used to deflect the ion beam by 180 ° . The enriched and depleted beams went into collectors . 
 When the calutron was first operated on 2 December 1941 , just days before the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brought the United States into World War II , a uranium beam intensity of 5 <unk> ( μA ) was received by the collector . Lawrence 's hunch about the effect of the air molecules in the vacuum chamber was confirmed . A nine @-@ hour run on 14 January 1942 with a 50 μA beam produced 18 micrograms ( μg ) of uranium enriched to 25 % uranium @-@ 235 , about ten times as much as Nier had produced . By February , improvements in the technique allowed it to generate a 1 @,@ 400 μA beam . That month , 75 μg samples enriched to 30 % were shipped to the British and the Metallurgical Laboratory in Chicago . 
 Other researchers also investigated electromagnetic isotope separation . At Princeton University , a group led by Henry D. Smyth and Robert R. Wilson developed a device known as an isotron . Using a klystron , they were able to separate isotopes using high @-@ voltage electricity rather than magnetism . Work continued until February 1943 , when , in view of the greater success of the calutron , work was discontinued and the team was transferred to other duties . At Cornell University a group under Lloyd P. Smith that included William E. Parkins , and A. Theodore Forrester devised a radial magnetic separator . They were surprised that their beams were more precise than expected , and , like Lawrence , deduced that it was a result of stabilization of the beam by air in the vacuum chamber . In February 1942 , their team was consolidated with Lawrence 's in Berkeley . They posted their results to the Physical Review from a railroad station en route to California . Their paper was classified secret , but was published after the war . 
 = = Research = = 
 While the process had been demonstrated to work , considerable effort was still required before a prototype could be tested in the field . Lawrence assembled a team of physicists to tackle the problems , including David Bohm , Edward Condon , Donald Cooksey , A. Theodore Forrester , Irving Langmuir , Kenneth Ross MacKenzie , Frank Oppenheimer , J. Robert Oppenheimer , William E. Parkins , Bernard Peters and Joseph <unk> . In November 1943 they were joined by a British Mission headed by Oliphant that included fellow Australian physicists Harrie Massey and Eric Burhop , and British physicists such as Joan Curran and Thomas Allibone . 
 Lawrence had a much larger cyclotron under construction at Berkeley , one with a 184 @-@ inch ( 470 cm ) magnet . This was converted into a calutron that was switched on for the first time on 26 May 1942 . Like the 37 @-@ inch version , it looked like a giant C when viewed from above . The operator sat in the open end , whence the temperature could be regulated , the position of the electrodes adjusted , and even components replaced through an airlock while it was running . The new , more powerful calutron was not used to produce enriched uranium , but for experiments with multiple ion sources . This meant having more collectors , but it multiplied the throughput . 
 The problem was that the beams interfered with each other , producing a series of oscillations called hash . An arrangement was devised that minimized the interference , resulting in reasonably good beams being produced in September 1942 . Robert Oppenheimer and Stan Frankel invented the magnetic shim , a device used to adjust the homogeneity of a magnetic field . These were sheets of iron about 3 feet ( 1 m ) in width that were bolted to the top and bottom of the vacuum tank . The effect of the shims was to slightly increase the magnetic field in such a way as to help focus the ionic beam . Work would continue on the shims through 1943 . The main calutron patents were Methods of and apparatus for separating materials ( Lawrence ) , Magnetic shims ( Oppenheimer and Frankel ) , and Calutron system ( Lawrence ) . 
 Burhop and Bohm later studied the characteristics of electric discharges in magnetic fields , today known as Bohm diffusion . Their papers on the properties of plasmas under magnetic containment would find utilization in the post @-@ war world in research into controlled nuclear fusion . Other technical problems were more mundane but no less important . Although the beams had low intensity , they could , over many hours of operation , still melt the collectors . A water cooling system was therefore added to the collectors and the tank liner . Procedures were developed for cleaning the " gunk " and " crud " from the inside of the vacuum tank . A particular problem was blockage of the slits , which caused the ionic beams to lose focus , or stop entirely . 
 The chemists had to find a way of producing quantities of uranium tetrachloride ( UCl 
 4 ) from uranium oxide . ( Nier had used uranium bromide . ) Initially , they produced it by using hydrogen to reduce uranium trioxide ( UO 
 3 ) to uranium dioxide ( UO 
 2 ) , which was then reacted with carbon tetrachloride ( CCl 
 4 ) to produce uranium tetrachloride . Charles A. Kraus proposed a better method for large @-@ scale production that involved reacting the uranium oxide with carbon tetrachloride at high temperature and pressure . This produced uranium pentachloride ( UCl 
 5 ) and phosgene ( <unk> 
 2 ) . While nowhere near as nasty as the uranium hexafluoride used by the gaseous diffusion process , uranium tetrachloride is hygroscopic , so work with it had to be undertaken in gloveboxes that were kept dry with phosphorus pentoxide ( P 
 4O 
 10 ) . The presence of phosgene , a lethal gas , required that the chemists wore gas masks when handling it . 
 Of the $ 19 @.@ 6 million spent on research and development of the electromagnetic process , $ 18 million ( 92 percent ) was spent at the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley , and further work conducted at Brown University , Johns Hopkins University and Purdue University , and by the Tennessee Eastman corporation . During 1943 , the emphasis shifted from research to development , engineering , and the training of workers to operate the production facilities at the Clinton Engineer Works in Oak Ridge , Tennessee . By the middle of 1944 , there were nearly 1 @,@ 200 people working at the Radiation Laboratory .

 Much of the great progress on the electromagnetic process can be attributed to Lawrence 's leadership style . His audacity , optimism and enthusiasm were contagious . His staff put in long hours , and University of California administrators sliced through red tape despite not knowing what the project was about . Government officials began to view the development of atomic bombs in time to affect the outcome of the war as a genuine possibility . Vannevar Bush , the director of the Office of Scientific Research and Development ( OSRD ) , which was overseeing the project , visited Berkeley in February 1942 , and found the atmosphere there " stimulating " and " refreshing " . On 9 March 1942 , he reported to the President , Franklin D. Roosevelt , that it might be possible to produce enough material for a bomb by mid @-@ 1943 , based on new estimates from Robert Oppenheimer that the critical mass of a sphere of pure uranium @-@ 235 was between 2 @.@ 0 and 2 @.@ 5 kilograms . 
 The experiments with the 184 @-@ inch magnet led to the construction of a prototype calutron called the XA . This contained a rectangular , three @-@ coil magnet with a horizontal field in which the calutron tanks could stand side by side , with four vacuum tanks , each with a double source . At the 25 June 1942 meeting of the S @-@ 1 Executive Committee , which had superseded the S @-@ 1 Uranium Committee on 19 June , there was a proposal to build the electromagnetic plant at Oak Ridge , where the other Manhattan Project facilities would be located , for reasons of economy and security . Lawrence lodged an objection due to his desire to have the electromagnetic separation plant located much nearer to Berkeley . The Shasta Dam area in California remained under consideration for the electromagnetic plant until September 1942 , by which time Lawrence had dropped his objection . The 25 June meeting also designated Stone & Webster as the primary contractor for the design and engineering . 
 The Army assumed responsibility for the Manhattan Project on 17 September 1942 , with Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves , Jr . , as director , although the Army did not formally take over the contracts with the University of California from the OSRD until 1 May 1943 . Major Thomas T. Crenshaw , Jr . , became California Area Engineer in August 1942 , with Captain Harold A. Fidler , who soon replaced him , as his assistant . Crenshaw established his office in the Donner Laboratory at the University of California . In September 1942 , the S @-@ 1 Executive Committee recommended that a five @-@ tank pilot plant be built along with a 200 @-@ tank section of a production plant . 
 Between October 1942 and November 1943 , Groves paid monthly visits to the Radiation Laboratory in Berkeley . Reports indicated that compared to the alternatives of a gaseous diffusion plant or a plutonium @-@ producing nuclear reactor , an electromagnetic plant would take longer and require more scarce materials to build , and need more manpower and more electricity to operate . The cost of a kilogram of fissile material would therefore be much greater . On the other hand , while the alternative processes still faced considerable technical obstacles , the electromagnetic process was proven to work , and could be built in stages that would immediately start producing fissile material . Groves cancelled the pilot plant on 14 November , in favor of proceeding immediately with the production plant . 
 The Radiation Laboratory forwarded the preliminary designs for a production plant to Stone & Webster before the end of the year , but one important issue remained unsettled . Oppenheimer contended that weapons @-@ grade uranium would have to be nearly pure uranium @-@ 235 . Edward Lofgren and Martin Kamen argued that a second stage of enrichment would be required . The two stages became known as Alpha and Beta . In March 1943 , Groves approved the construction of five Alpha and two Beta racetracks . In September , he authorized four more Alpha racetracks , which became known as Alpha II , along with two more Beta racetracks to process their product . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Construction of the electromagnetic plant at Oak Ridge , codenamed Y @-@ 12 , commenced 18 February 1943 . The facility would eventually comprise nine major process buildings and 200 other structures covering almost 80 acres ( 32 ha ) of floor space . The 825 @-@ acre ( 334 ha ) site in Bear Creek Valley southwest of the Oak Ridge township was selected in the hope that the surrounding ridge lines might contain a major explosion or nuclear accident . Problems with the substratum required the excavation crews to perform more blasting and excavation to provide adequate foundations for the heavy machinery in the facilities . 
 Supplies and materials of all kinds poured in : 2 @,@ 157 carloads of electrical equipment , 1 @,@ 219 of heavy equipment , 5 @,@ 389 of lumber , 1 @,@ 407 of pipe and fittings , 1 @,@ 188 of steel , 257 of valves , and 11 of welding electrodes . The racetracks required some 85 @,@ 000 vacuum tubes , the entire national output for 1943 , including that of a plant that was still under construction . Where possible , off @-@ the @-@ shelf components were used , but all too many components of the calutrons were unique . Two purchasing departments were established , one in Boston near Stone & Webster for facility equipment , and the other at Oak Ridge for construction supplies . 
 The Chief Engineer of the Manhattan District , Colonel James C. Marshall , and his deputy , Lieutenant Colonel Kenneth D. Nichols , discovered that the electromagnetic isotope separation process would require 5 @,@ 000 short tons ( 4 @,@ 500 tonnes ) of copper , which was in desperately short supply . However , they realized that silver could be substituted , in an 11 : 10 ratio . On 3 August 1942 , Nichols met with the Under Secretary of the Treasury , Daniel W. Bell , and asked for the transfer of silver bullion from the West Point Bullion Depository . Nichols later recalled the conversation : 
 He explained the procedure for transferring the silver and asked , " How much do you need ? " I replied , " Six thousand tons . " ' How many troy ounces is that ? " he asked . In fact I did not know how to convert tons to troy ounces , and neither did he . A little impatient , I responded , " I don 't know how many troy ounces we need but I know I need six thousand tons – that is a definite quantity . What difference does it make how we express the quantity ? " He replied rather indignantly , " Young man , you may think of silver in tons , but the Treasury will always think of silver in troy ounces . " 
 Eventually , 14 @,@ 700 short tons ( 13 @,@ 300 tonnes ; 430 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 troy ounces ) of silver were used , then worth over $ 1 billion . Nichols had to provide a monthly accounting to the Treasury . The 1 @,@ 000 @-@ troy @-@ ounce ( 31 kg ) silver bars were taken under guard to the Defense Plant Corporation in Carteret , New Jersey , where they were cast into cylindrical billets , and then to Phelps Dodge in Bayway , New Jersey , where they were extruded into strips 0 @.@ 625 inches ( 15 @.@ 9 mm ) thick , 3 inches ( 7 @.@ 6 cm ) wide and 40 feet ( 12 m ) long . Some 258 carloads were shipped under guard by rail to Allis @-@ Chalmers in Milwaukee , Wisconsin , where they were wound onto magnetic coils and sealed into welded casings . Finally , they moved by unguarded flatcars to the Clinton Engineer Works . There , special procedures were instituted for handling the silver . When they had to drill holes in it , they did so over paper so that the filings could be collected . After the war , all the machinery was dismantled and cleaned and the floorboards beneath the machinery were ripped up and burned to recover minute amounts of silver . In the end , only 1 / 3,600,000th was lost . In May 1970 , the last 67 short tons ( 61 tonnes ; 2 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 troy ounces ) of silver was replaced with copper and returned to the Treasury . 
 The XAX racetrack with two tanks and three coils was ready to train workers in August 1943 . Bugs were discovered , but were not aggressively followed up . The first Alpha process building , 9201 @-@ 1 , was completed on 1 November 1943 . When the first racetrack was started up for testing on schedule in November , the 14 @-@ ton vacuum tanks crept out of alignment by as much as 3 inches ( 8 cm ) because of the power of the magnets and had to be fastened more securely . A more serious problem arose when the magnetic coils started shorting out . In December Groves ordered a magnet broken open , and handfuls of rust were found inside . Moisture was also a problem in its own right , as was the winding of the wire , which was too tight . Groves ordered the racetracks to be torn down and the magnets sent back to the factory to be cleaned and rewound . Rigid standards for preparation and cleanliness were instituted to prevent a recurrence of these problems . 
 Training for the Beta tracks shifted from the XAX to the XBX training and development racetrack in November 1943 . A second Alpha I racetrack became operational in January 1944 . The first Beta racetrack and the third and first Alpha racetracks , now repaired , became operational in March 1944 , and the fourth Alpha racetrack in April 1944 . A third building , 9201 @-@ 3 , contained a fifth racetrack that incorporated some modifications , and was known as Alpha I1 ⁄ 2 . This became operational on 3 June 1944 . Work on the Alpha and Beta chemistry buildings , <unk> and 9203 , commenced in February 1943 , and was completed in September . Work on the Beta process building , 9204 @-@ 1 , began in May 1943 , and was ready for operation on 13 March 1944 , but was not completed until September 1944 . 
 Groves authorized Alpha II in September 1943 . This consisted of two new Alpha process buildings , 9201 @-@ 4 and 9201 @-@ 5 , another Beta , 9204 @-@ 2 , an extension to the Alpha chemistry building , and a new Beta chemistry building , 9206 . When 9206 opened , the old Beta chemistry building , 9203 , was converted into a laboratory . Work started on the new Alpha II process buildings on 2 November 1943 ; the first racetrack was completed in July 1944 , and all four were operational by 1 October 1944 . The Alpha II racetracks were configured in a linear layout rather than an oval , although they were still called racetracks . In all , there were 864 Alpha calutrons , arranged in nine racetracks of 96 . There were only 36 calutrons in each Beta racetrack , for a total of 288 calutrons , although only 216 of them were ever operated . 
 Work on the new Beta process building commenced on 20 October 1943 . Equipment installation began on 1 April 1944 , and it was ready for use on 10 September 1944 . A third Beta process building , 9204 @-@ 3 , was authorized in May 1944 to process the output of the K @-@ 25 gaseous diffusion plant . It was completed on 15 May 1945 . A fourth Beta process building , 9204 @-@ 4 , was authorized on 2 April 1945 and was completed by 1 December 1945 . A new group of Alpha chemistry buildings known as the <unk> group was commenced in June 1944 , but work was halted in June 1945 before they were completed . Along with these main buildings , there were offices , workshops , warehouses and other structures . There were two steam plants for heating , and a power plant for electricity .

 The Alpha racetracks were a 24 @-@ fold magnification of the XA calutron that could hold 96 calutron Alpha tanks . The calutrons were upright and arrayed facing each other in pairs of inner and outer machines . To minimize magnetic losses , and to economize on steel consumption , the assembly was curved into an oval shape that formed a closed magnetic loop 122 feet ( 37 m ) long , 77 feet ( 23 m ) wide and 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) high , in the shape of a racetrack ; hence the name . The two Alpha I buildings , 9201 @-@ 1 and 9201 @-@ 2 , each contained two racetracks , with only one in the Alpha I1 ⁄ 2 , 9201 @-@ 3 . The Beta racetracks were smaller , linear in shape , and optimized for recovery rather than production , with only 36 instead of 96 process bins . The four Alpha II racetracks were also linear in configuration . They incorporated many improvements , the most important being that they had four sources instead of just two . They also had improved magnets and vacuum systems . 
 Tennessee Eastman was hired to manage Y @-@ 12 on the usual cost plus fixed fee basis , with a fee of $ 22 @,@ 500 per month plus $ 7 @,@ 500 per racetrack for the first seven racetracks and $ 4 @,@ 000 per additional racetrack . Workers were recruited in the Knoxville area . The typical recruit was a young woman , a recent graduate of a local high school . Training was initially conducted at the University of Tennessee . Training switched to Berkeley from April to September 1943 , where it was conducted on the XA calutron and a 1 : 16 scale model of the Alpha racetrack , and then to Oak Ridge when the XAX calutron became available . Some 2 @,@ 500 would be required once all the Alpha II calutrons were available . The Tennessee Eastman payroll at Y @-@ 12 ballooned from 10 @,@ 000 in mid @-@ 1944 to 25 @,@ 000 in mid @-@ 1945 . For security reasons , the trainees were not informed of the purpose of the equipment they were taught to operate . 
 The calutrons were initially operated by scientists from Berkeley to remove bugs and achieve a reasonable operating rate . Then the Tennessee Eastman operators who had only a high school education took over . Nichols compared unit production data , and pointed out to Lawrence that the young " hillbilly " girl operators were outproducing his <unk> They agreed to a production race and Lawrence lost , a morale boost for the Tennessee Eastman workers and supervisors . The girls were trained like soldiers not to reason why , while " the scientists could not refrain from time @-@ consuming investigation of the cause of even minor fluctuations of the dials " . 
 For a while , the calutrons suffered from a series of debilitating breakdowns and equipment failures , exacerbated by a shortage of spare parts . Hopes that the Alpha II racetracks would be more reliable soon faded , as they were plagued by insulator failures . These problems were gradually overcome . The first shipments of enriched uranium to the Manhattan Project 's Los Alamos Laboratory were made in March 1944 , consisting of Alpha product enriched to 13 to 15 percent uranium @-@ 235 . While of no use in a bomb , it was urgently required for experiments with enriched uranium . The last shipment of Alpha product was on made 11 May 1944 . On 7 June 1944 , Y @-@ 12 made its first delivery of weapons @-@ grade Beta product , enriched to as high as 89 % uranium @-@ 235 . 
 A major problem was that of loss of feed material and product . Only 1 part in 5 @,@ 825 of the feed material became finished product . About 90 percent was splattered over the feed bottles or vacuum tanks . This problem was particularly acute with the enriched feed of the Beta calutrons . Extraordinary efforts were made to recover product , including burning the carbon receiver liners to recover the uranium in them . Despite everything , some 17 @.@ 4 percent of Alpha product and 5 @.@ 4 percent of Beta product was lost . Frank Spedding from the Manhattan Project 's Ames Laboratory and Philip Baxter from the British Mission were sent to advise on improvements to recovery methods . The death of a worker from exposure to phosgene also prompted a search for a safer production process . 
 In February 1945 , slightly enriched 1 @.@ 4 percent uranium @-@ 235 feed material began arriving from the S @-@ 50 liquid thermal diffusion plant . Shipments of product from S @-@ 50 were discontinued in April . S @-@ 50 product was fed into K @-@ 25 instead . In March 1945 , Y @-@ 12 began receiving feed enriched to 5 percent from K @-@ 25 . The output of these plants was in the form of uranium hexafluoride ( UF 
 6 ) . This was converted to uranium trioxide , which then went into the usual process for conversion to uranium tetrachloride . On 5 August 1945 , K @-@ 25 started producing feed enriched to 23 percent , enough to be fed straight into the Beta racetracks . The remaining Alpha product was then fed into K @-@ 25 . By September 1945 , the calutrons had produced 88 kilograms of product with an average enrichment of 84 @.@ 5 percent , and the Beta racetracks turned out another 953 kilograms enriched to 95 percent by the end of the year . Enriched uranium from the calutrons provided the fissile component of the Little Boy atomic bomb used in the atomic bombing of Hiroshima in August 1945 . 
 With the war over , the Alpha tracks began to suspend operations on 4 September 1945 , and ceased operation completely on 22 September . The last two Beta tracks went into full operation in November and December 1945 , processing feed from K @-@ 25 and the new K @-@ 27 gaseous diffusion plant . By May 1946 , studies suggested that the gaseous diffusion plants could fully enrich the uranium by themselves without accidentally creating a critical mass . After a trial demonstrated that this was the case , Groves ordered all but one Beta track shut down in December 1946 . 
 The total cost of the electromagnetic project up to the end of the Manhattan Project on 31 December 1946 was $ 673 million ( equivalent to $ 8 @.@ 16 billion in 2015 ) . 
 = = Postwar years = = 
 The workforce at Y @-@ 12 dropped from a wartime peak of 22 @,@ 482 on 21 August 1945 to less than 1 @,@ 700 in 1949 . All the calutrons were removed and dismantled , except for the XAX and XBX training tracks in Building 9731 , and the Beta 3 racetracks in Building 9204 – 3 . In 1947 , Eugene Wigner , the director of the Oak Ridge National Laboratory ( ORNL ) , asked the Atomic Energy Commission for permission to use the Beta calutrons to produce isotopes for physics experiments . This was granted , and a wide range of isotopes was produced . Lithium @-@ 6 from the Beta calutrons was used for research into thermonuclear weapons . Many other isotopes were used for peaceful scientific and medical purposes . The Beta 3 racetracks were transferred to the ORNL in March 1950 . By the mid @-@ 1950s , the Beta calutrons had produced quantities of all the naturally occurring stable isotopes except those of Osmium , which had to wait until April 1960 . The calutrons continued to produce isotopes until 1998 . As of 2015 , they are still on standby . 
 Like the United States , the Soviet Union ( USSR ) carried out research on multiple enrichment technologies for the Soviet atomic bomb project . A trial electromagnetic process was carried out in 1946 with a calutron using a magnet taken from Germany . A site was chosen for an electromagnetic plant at Sverdlovsk @-@ 45 in 1946 . The pilot plant , known as Plant 418 , was completed in 1948 . A more efficient design was developed in which the particle beams were bent by 225 ° instead of 180 ° as in the American calutron . It was used to complete the uranium process after technical difficulties were encountered with the gaseous diffusion process . Uranium enriched to about 40 percent uranium @-@ 235 was brought to Sverdlovsk @-@ 45 for final enrichment to between 92 and 98 percent . After the problems with the gaseous diffusion process were resolved in 1950 , it was decided not to proceed with a full @-@ scale electromagnetic plant . As of 2009 , it remains operational . In 1969 , a research calutron known as S @-@ 2 was built at <unk> @-@ 16 for high @-@ efficiency separation of isotopes of heavy elements like plutonium . 
 In 1945 , the British atomic bomb project built a 180 ° calutron , similar in design to an American Beta calutron , at the Atomic Energy Research Establishment at Harwell , Oxfordshire . Owing to the success of the gaseous diffusion plant at Capenhurst , electromagnetic separation was not pursued by the United Kingdom , and the calutron was used to separate isotopes for research . The 180 ° design was not ideal for this purpose , so Harwell built a 90 ° calutron , <unk> , the " Heavy Elements and Radioactive Material Electromagnetic Separator " . This was inspired by France 's <unk> and PARIS separators at the Laboratoire René Bernas of the University of Paris IX in Orsay , and <unk> at the military research laboratory of the Commissariat à l <unk> <unk> et aux <unk> alternatives in Bruyères @-@ le @-@ Châtel . Israel , Japan and France also built some research calutrons , including the <unk> and <unk> separators at the <unk> Nuclear Research Center . There is also CERN 's Isotope Separator On @-@ Line Detector ( <unk> ) , which was built in 1967 . Four research and production calutrons were built at the China Institute of Atomic Energy in Beijing of identical design to those of the USSR in the early 1960s . A calutron at the Saha Institute of Nuclear Physics at Bidhan Nagar in India was used to produce plutonium for India 's first nuclear test on 18 May 1974 . 
 After the 1990 – 91 Gulf War , <unk> determined that Iraq had been pursuing a calutron program to enrich uranium . Iraq chose to develop the electromagnetic process over more modern , economic , and efficient methods of enrichment because calutrons were easier to build , with fewer technical challenges , and the components required to build them were not subject to export controls . At the time the program was discovered , Iraq was estimated to be two or three years away from producing enough material for nuclear weapons . The program was destroyed in the Gulf War . Consequently , the Nuclear Suppliers Group added the electromagnetic separation equipment to its guidelines for transfers of nuclear @-@ related dual @-@ use equipment , material and technology .

 " Wallace " is a hip hop song that lasts for a duration of three minute and fifty seconds , with R & B influences and a " pounding " beat . Brennan Carley from Spin described the song as Banks " float [ ing ] between <unk> R & B and rapid @-@ fire , corner @-@ side spitting " . Throughout December 2014 , Banks released a series of videos in which she broke down tracks from Broke with Expensive Taste and revealed how each song came to be , dubbed ' 16 Days of Azealia ' . During the commentary video for " Wallace " , Banks revealed that she first received the instrumental for the song in 2007 , from DJ Skeet Skeet . According to Banks , the instrumental was unused for a period of time , until she decided that she only needed the most original material for her album , it was at this point in which she wrote the song . In an interview with Complex , Banks stated that the song is about " being really hot and high and horny " . 
 In January 2012 , Banks signed a record deal with Interscope and Polydor Records to work on new music , and a month later , she announced the title of the album – Broke with Expensive Taste . A year later , she handed a complete version of Broke with Expensive Taste in to the labels . Banks initially thought it would receive favorable reception ; however , the representatives told Banks that she had not recorded a " hit " single for the album . Ultimately , Banks ended the record deal with Interscope / Polydor in July 2014 . She later approached Jeff Kwatinetz and signed a contract with his company , Prospect Park . Banks premiered " Wallace " during her tour in Glasgow , Scotland , on September 16 , 2014 . She eventually released the album on November 7 , 2014 .

 " Ego " is a song recorded by American singer Beyoncé for the deluxe edition of her third studio album , I Am ... Sasha Fierce ( 2008 ) . The song was composed by Elvis Williams , Harold Lilly , and Beyoncé . " Ego " was officially remixed with additional vocals from hip hop artist , Kanye West . Initially planned to be released in January 2009 as the second urban single in the US along with the fourth US and third international single " Halo " , the release of " Ego " was canceled and replaced by " Diva " . " Ego " was later serviced as the third urban single , and fifth overall single in the US on May 19 , 2009 alongside the sixth US and fourth international single " Sweet Dreams " . 
 " Ego " was originally written for singer Chrisette Michele , who turned it down . It was eventually proposed to Beyoncé who used it for the deluxe edition of I Am ... Sasha Fierce . In the song , Beyoncé sings about her love for the " huge ego " of her love interest . " Ego " was generally well received by music critics , many of whom praised the fact that Beyoncé opted to show some of her vocal limitations in a part of the song . Critics also noted that " Ego " could even have been placed in either disc of I Am .. Sasha Fierce as it combines elements of both sides of Beyoncé 's split musical personality . The remix version of " Ego " was nominated for Best Rap / Sung Collaboration at the 52nd Grammy Awards . 
 " Ego " became the fifth consecutive song from I Am ... Sasha Fierce to reach the top 40 on US Billboard Hot 100 , peaking at 39 . It reached number three on the US Hot R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Songs and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) .

 " Ego " was written by Elvis Williams , Harold Lilly and Beyoncé while production was handled by Williams and Beyoncé . It was originally written for singer Chrisette Michele for her 2009 album Epiphany . However , Michele turned it down because she had written all the songs on her then @-@ upcoming album and feared that the song might not suit her . She said , " You don ’ t know if they ’ re going to be able to capture your voice the same way that you captured it yourself . " " Ego " was eventually proposed to Beyoncé , who used it for the deluxe edition of I Am ... Sasha Fierce . It was officially remixed with added vocals from Kanye West , whom Beyoncé described as the " perfect person " to be on the remix . Elaborating on her collaboration with West , she told MTV News , " [ Kanye 's ] voice sounds so wonderful on it . He definitely has the confidence and he backs it up . And that 's what this song is about . " The remix was included on the 2009 remix album Above and Beyoncé – Video Collection & Dance Mixes and the platinum edition of I Am ... Sasha Fierce . Andrew Burgess of musicOMH criticized West 's " lackadaisical and disappointing appearance " on the remix . 
 " Ego " and " Halo " were initially planned for simultaneous release in the US , following the 2008 dual lead singles " If I Were a Boy " and " Single Ladies ( Put a Ring on It ) " . However , the release of " Ego " was scrapped and replaced with " Diva " .

Joey Guerra of Houston Chronicle described the song as a blend of " old @-@ school soul riffs and double entendres " . 
 Lyrically , the song features Beyoncé as the female protagonist singing about her love for the " huge ego " of her lover . Jay Lustig of New Jersey On @-@ Line further noted that the song may be an insight into Beyoncé 's marriage to Jay @-@ Z. In an interview with Jayson Rodriguez of MTV News , Beyoncé clarified that " Ego " is on the Sasha Fierce disc because it is " fun " and very " Sasha Fierce " . She further explained that " Ego " reveals the story about someone being " very confident and having [ this ] swagger when they walk and when they talk , and that being one of the reasons why [ she is ] attracted to them . " The song explores the restrained vocals of Beyoncé singing " I talk like this , cos I can back it up " and consists of a piano breakdown . As Beyoncé sings , she lets out a slinky snarl in her voice . She describes the ego of her love interest as : " It ’ s too big , it ’ s too wide , it ’ s too strong , it won ’ t fit , it ’ s too much . " The remix of the song features Kanye West rapping on it . He sings the lines , " Now I ’ m standing next to Jay , who 's standing next to B / Could have been anywhere in the world , but you 're here with me / That 's good for my ego ... My ego is my imaginary friend / He was with me when I was only imagining . "

 " Ego " received positive reviews from critics , most of whom wrote that " Ego " , which is featured on the Sasha Fierce disc , could have also been placed on the I Am ... disc since the lyrics seem to showcase vulnerability and the desire to be loved back while the music is completely fun like Beyoncé 's alter ego . A writer for Billboard magazine gave the song a positive review , writing that " Ego " manages to combine elements of both sides of Beyoncé 's musical personality . He said that the song seems to be an homage to " old @-@ school R & B midtempo jams " . He went on to praise Beyoncé 's vocals , which according to him , she did not polish during the interlude , thus showing her real voice and limitations " just like the old days " . Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine was brief and said that the song could benefit from the first half of the album . Neil McCormick of the The Daily Telegraph chose " Ego " as the standout track on I Am ... Sasha Fierce , complimenting its lyrical content and calling it " playful boldness " . 
 Ann Powers of Los Angeles Times noted that in " Ego " , Beyoncé shows the spunk she developed playing Etta James in Cadillac Records . IGN Music described the song as one of the " genuine shining moments " where Beyoncé 's voice and the music are perfectly matched . The Village Voice 's Nana Ekua Brew @-@ Hammond described " Sasha Fierce " as " brassy , big @-@ headed , confrontational , and witty " and wrote that all these adjectives suit " Ego " .

Consequently , it debuted at number 153 on the UK Singles Chart and at number 81 on the UK R & B Chart on April 10 , 2010 . One week later , due to a considerable increase in airplay , it surged to number 60 on the UK Singles Chart and peaked at number 23 on the UK R & B Chart . It later managed a better peak at number 22 on the UK R & B Chart on April 24 , 2010 . " Ego " is the second single from I Am ... Sasha Fierce to enter both the Top 75 of UK Singles Chart and the Top 25 of the UK R & B Chart without a physical or a digital release , the first being " Diva " , which peaked at number 72 on the UK Singles Chart on May 24 , 2009 .

 Beyoncé made her directorial debut on the video for " Ego " with the choreographer Frank Gatson Jr , who had been working with her for twelve years by then , as the creative director . Gatson has been the creative director for many of her videos , such as " Suga Mama " , " Single Ladies ( Put a Ring on It ) " , and " Get Me Bodied " , as well as her last three world tours , including the I Am ... World Tour ( 2009 @-@ 2010 ) . Beyoncé let Gatson direct the video for " Ego " after he introduced her to a new choreographer , Sheryl Murakami . Beyoncé told Entertainment Weekly : " My goal for [ the ] video is simplicity ... In ' Single Ladies ( Put a Ring on It ) ' , I saw this old tape of Bob Fosse 's wife [ Gwen Verdon ] , and I used that as inspiration . I thought in this world , with all the technology and everything that 's going on , to strip everything down — great idea . So I kind of did the same thing , but glossy and black , for ' Ego ' . " 
 Like the music videos for " If I Were a Boy " , " Single Ladies ( Put A Ring On It ) " , and " Diva " , the one for " Ego " was shot in black and white . The word " bitch " is muted out when Beyoncé sings , " I got every reason to feel like I 'm that bitch ! " . " Ego " is the first video from I Am ... Sasha Fierce in which she has curly afro hair , similar to the one in " Work It Out " . It is also the first video from the Sasha Fierce disc of her album where she does not don her robot @-@ glove . The video features Beyoncé and her two backup female dancers all dressed in silver leotards and performing similar choreography , which has reminiscence of that of " Single Ladies ( Put a Ring on It ) " . Later , Beyoncé sits on a white glittery chair in front of the same tiled background ; she is wearing black coat and the two dancers are still dancing in unison around her . There are a few shots of her on the chair facing the back of the camera with the dancers doing the same . Beyoncé then gets up to join the dance being executed by the two female around the chair . This scene ends as they walk to the left of the camera , into the next scene . Beyoncé is still with the tiled background . She and her dancers are now holding poles as props with which they dance . During the same pole scene , some shots of her singing in the chair are intercut . In the next scene , with the same tiled background , Beyoncé is leaning against the wall as the bridge of the song has been reached . Her dancers spin in heels around her , and they all then continue to dance against the wall . The last scene shows Beyoncé in the chair , without the black jacket and still dancing until the song ends .

 A " bootlegged " version of the music video , featuring Sheryl Murakami performing the choreography , was leaked onto YouTube in early March 2009 . In the B @-@ roll footage on Above and Beyoncé , it was shown that a clay sculpture of Beyoncé was made for the video of " Ego " . However , the sculpture was not shown in the final version of the video . Three edits exist for the " Ego " music video : an official video , a remix video featuring Kanye West , and a fan @-@ exclusive video . The official video premiered on Beyoncé 's official website on May 21 , 2009 . The remix music video , which features a cameo appearance of Kanye West , was included on the remix album with videography Above and Beyoncé – Video Collection & Dance Mixes . It premiered on the June 15 , 2009 , episode of BET 's Access Granted . In the remix video , Kanye West begins his rap in an empty room next to a follow spot . At the end of his rap , he points the light towards the camera and the shot fades in white to Beyoncé 's scenes . The rest of the video is nearly identical to the original video . Mark Richardson of Pitchfork Media commented that the video shows " in @-@ your @-@ face Kanye spitting before Beyoncé shows off some of her ' Single Ladies ' moves . " It was ranked at number 38 on BET 's Notarized : Top 100 Videos of 2009 countdown . A fan @-@ exclusive version of " Ego " was included on Above and Beyoncé , in which only Beyoncé appears . The whole video is a continuous double @-@ angled scene where she is seated on the throne chair previously seen in the original video . 
 Upon its release , the music video for " Ego " received mixed reviews from music critics who noted similarities with the one for " Single Ladies ( Put a Ring on It ) " . A writer of Rap @-@ Up magazine described the video as " Single Ladies ( Part 2 ) " . Tracey Ford of AOL described the video as " an ode to multiple personalities , leotards and all things ' diva . ' " Nick Levine of Digital Spy commented that the video would divide critics ' opinions whether it is " a sexy , burlesque @-@ inspired variation on the theme [ Beyoncé ] established in the other two videos from the Sasha Fierce side of the album , or just a ' Single Ladies ' retread with more crotch and rump " . Leah Greenblatt of the magazine Entertainment Weekly gave a negative review for the video , saying that it was very similar to the one for " Single Ladies " noting " [ the music video for ] ' Ego ' feels an awful like the ( admittedly awesome ) ' Single Ladies ' with a spiral perm . " Tamar Anitai of MTV was also negative towards the video for the song , writing that it looks like a dress rehearsal of the video for " Single Ladies " but " in drag " . She further wrote , " Anyway , while the ' 80s horns @-@ and @-@ organ vibe delivers some throwback flavor , I 'm not feeling the circa @-@ 2002 @-@ Christina @-@ Aguilera curly wig or the satin prom gloves . And the boob grabbing is a little too gratuitous . And when Beyonce says ' It 's too big , it 's too wide , it 's too strong , it won 't fit , it 's too much , ' I 'm not even positive that she 's really referring to an ego . " Nadia Mendoza of The Sun noted that Beyoncé 's appeal is " fast <unk> the more she morphs into alter ego Sasha Fierce " further describing the dance moves in the video as " bizarre " . She finished her review by writing , " [ Beyoncé ] warbles along to her track while shaking her booty in a not very flattering leotard in a similar vein to the iconic Single Ladies vid [ eo ] . But unfortunately for her , Ego is not half as catchy . "

 Beyoncé performed " Ego " as part of the set list during her world tour , the I Am ... World Tour ( 2009 ) . When she performed the song live in Seattle before of its release as a single , Kanye West joined her onstage and rapped : " I got a big , ha ha ha , ego / She love my big , ha ha ha , ego / She stroke my big , ha ha ha , ego ... " . West later made a surprise appearance at Beyoncé 's concert in London on November 14 , 2010 , where he again rapped his verse . Eventually , the remix of " Ego " was included on Beyoncé 's 2010 live album , I Am ... World Tour as the fifteenth track . Andy Gill of The Independent listed the song as a highlight on the album .

 = St James ' Church , Sydney = 
 St James ' Church , commonly known as St James ' , King Street , is an Anglican parish church in inner city Sydney , Australia , consecrated in February 1824 and named in honour of St James the Great . It became a parish church in 1835 . Designed in the style of a Georgian town church by the transported convict architect Francis Greenway during the governorship of Lachlan Macquarie , St James ' is part of the historical precinct of Macquarie Street which includes other early colonial era buildings such as the Hyde Park Barracks . The church building is the oldest one extant in Sydney 's inner city region . It is listed on the Register of the National Estate and has been described as one of the world 's 80 greatest man @-@ made treasures . 
 The church has maintained its special role in the city 's religious , civic and musical life as well as its close associations with the city 's legal and medical professions through its proximity to the law courts and Sydney Hospital . Its original ministry was to the convict population of Sydney and it has continued to serve the city 's poor and needy in succeeding centuries . 
 Worship at St James ' is in a style commonly found in the High Church and moderate Anglo @-@ Catholic traditions of Anglicanism . It maintains the traditions of Anglican church music , with a robed choir singing psalms , anthems and responses in contrast to the great majority of churches in the Anglican Diocese of Sydney where services are generally celebrated in styles associated with Low Church and Evangelical Christian practices . The teaching at St James ' has a more liberal perspective than most churches in the diocese on issues of gender and the ordination of women . 
 = = Location = = 
 St James ' Church is located at 173 King Street , Sydney , in the legal and commercial district , near Hyde Park and adjoining Queen 's Square . The church forms part of a group of notable colonial buildings along Macquarie Street , which runs from Queen 's Square to Sydney Harbour . At the time of construction , the church and the buildings nearby were " Sydney 's most distinguished structures ... on the highest ground , and , socially speaking , in the best part of the city " . 
 The geographical parish of St James ' is one of the 57 parishes of Cumberland County , New South Wales , and it initially shared responsibility for an area that extended as far as Sydney Heads . St James ' acquired its own parish in 1835 . Its boundaries have since remained essentially unchanged . 
 The underground St James railway station is named after the church . The precinct around the church is informally known as St James ' . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Foundation and consecration = = = 
 The building of St James ' Church was commissioned by Governor Lachlan Macquarie in 1819 , designed by the convict architect Francis Greenway and constructed between 1820 and 1824 using convict labour . Governor Macquarie and Commissioner John Bigge laid the foundation stone on Thursday , 7 October 1819 . The building was originally intended to serve as a courthouse as Macquarie had plans for a large cathedral to be built on the present location of St Andrew 's Cathedral but they were put on hold by the intervention of Bigge who had been appointed to conduct a Royal Commission into the colonial government . Bigge initially approved of the courthouse project but by February 1820 , less than four months after his arrival , he strongly recommended its conversion into a church . " The reason for Bigge 's change of mind may be found in the appointment , three years later , of his brother @-@ in @-@ law [ and secretary ] , Mr TH Scott , a wine merchant , as Archdeacon " . The design of the courthouse was modified before construction with the addition of a steeple at the western end , to serve as a church , while the adjacent school buildings were put into use as a courthouse . The first service was held in the unfinished church on the Day of Epiphany , 6 January 1822 , the text being from Isaiah , Chapter 60 : " Arise ! Shine , for thy light has come . The glory of the Lord has risen upon thee " . It was anticipated in the Sydney Gazette 's report of the event that the church , when fitted out with stalls and galleries , would hold 2 @,@ 000 people . The church was consecrated by the senior chaplain , the Reverend Samuel Marsden , on 11 February 1824 . 
 = = = First years : 1824 – 38 = = = 
 Before the building of St James ' , Sydney 's growing population had been served by St Philip 's Church , York Street . However , as St James ' was able to hold more people than St Philip 's and clergy meetings as well as ordinations were held there , it quickly became the centre of official church activity . 
 There was both official and general concern about the lack of morality within the predominantly male population , and the establishment of churches and of education was seen as a method of combatting this . The 19th @-@ century church historian , Edward Symonds , credited a " better moral and spiritual tone " in the colony to " decent churches " and " the advent of additional clergy , headed by the Revd William Cowper , in 1808 " . The first rector of St James ' , the Reverend Richard Hill , was ordained specifically for colonial ministry and sent from London as assistant to William Cowper at St Philip 's . Hill was energetic and a good organiser , with progressive views on education . He instigated a number of projects to aid the community , including an infants ' school in the crypt of the church and a Sunday School . 
 The focus of the church 's liturgy at the time was on preaching and the church 's interior reflected this . The east end of the church had a triple @-@ decker pulpit placed centrally , from which the service was led and the sermon preached . From this pulpit Bishops Broughton , Pattison , Selwyn , Barker and Barry preached . The parish clerk led the congregation in the responses from its lower level . Between the three windows which at that time occupied the eastern wall , there were two large panels displaying the words of the Lord 's Prayer , the Apostles ' Creed and the Ten Commandments . The church was full of box pews which faced each other across a central aisle . The western end had a gallery , which is still in place , for the convicts . <unk> were rented to provide a source of income for the church and the whole was arranged in " rigid social order " with the poor occupying the free seats . Sunday services consisted of Morning and Evening Prayer , with Holy Communion taking place only occasionally as an addition to the regular service . For this reason , there was no visual emphasis on the communion table , which was a small portable one , and no reredos . 
 St James ' suffered from a major scandal in the late 1820s ( " a period of personal quarrels and violent newspaper controversies " ) when Commissioner Bigge 's secretary and brother @-@ in @-@ law , Thomas Hobbes Scott , who had been made Archdeacon of New South Wales in 1825 , came into conflict with a parishioner , Edward Smith Hall . Archdeacon Scott ordered that Hall should vacate the pew he rented at St James ' for himself and his six daughters . As Hall continued to occupy the pew , constables attended Sunday services to prevent his occupation of the pew by boarding it up and making it secure with iron bands . Hall , critical of both the archdeacon and Governor Ralph Darling , was also a partner with Arthur Hill in the ownership of newspaper The Monitor . He published an attack on the archdeacon , for which he was sued for libel . The courts fined him only £ 1 and placed him on a bond . Hall appealed to Reginald Heber , Bishop of Calcutta ( who was the relevant ecclesiastical authority at the time ) and to the law where he was awarded £ 25 damages . The archdeacon , who was extremely unpopular , returned to London in 1828 . 
 The first major alteration to the church was the enclosing of the south portico to form a vestry . In 1832 John Verge constructed another vestry at the eastern end of the church , in strict conformity with the architectural style of Greenway . Growth of the congregation necessitated further changes . Galleries were added along the northern and eastern walls . As the three eastern windows had been blocked by Verge 's vestry , the interior became increasingly badly lit with every change . Verge 's solution was to pierce ocular windows high in the walls to light the galleries . 
 In 1836 , the Reverend Richard Hill had a fit of apoplexy in the vestry and died . Soon after this dramatic event , and while the church was still in mourning , the Right Reverend William Grant Broughton was installed as Bishop of Australia during a service in St James ' lasting five hours . Since Macquarie 's plans for a new cathedral on George Street had not come to fruition , Broughton acted as if St James ' were a pro @-@ cathedral . Robert Cartwright and then Napoleon <unk> succeeded Richard Hill at St James ' . 
 = = = Ministry of Robert Allwood : 1840 – 84 = = = 
 In 1839 the Reverend Robert Allwood , educated at Eton College and the University of Cambridge , arrived in Sydney and was appointed to St James ' by Bishop Broughton in which parish , he served for 44 years until his retirement in 1884 . Allwood was an important patron of education in Victorian Sydney . Under him , the parish school expanded and his teacher training college became a " model school " . He was also the principal tutor at St James ' College , which originally met in St James ' parsonage ( on the corner of King Street and Macquarie Street ) until it was transferred to Lyndhurst at The Glebe . 
 In 1848 , St James ' was the venue for a full military funeral , " attended by 150 carriages " and in 1878 Allwood officiated at the wedding of Nora Robinson and Alexander Kirkman Finlay . As the second vice @-@ regal wedding in the colony this ceremony was attended by many dignitaries and attracted a " crushing " crowd of 10 @,@ 000 cheering onlookers . 
 Unlike Hill , Allwood advocated the principles of the Oxford Movement ( also known as " Tractarianism " after its publication of Tracts for the Times ) , which stressed the historical continuity of the Church of England , and placed a high importance upon the sacraments and the liturgy . " The culmination " of a trend towards Tractarianism in the colony was the founding in 1845 , of St James ' College – " the first seminary for training local ordinands " . However , many colonial Anglicans were unhappy with Tractarian trends because Roman Catholics " were equated with Irish " , and with " Romanism " . " Serious differences opinion in matters of doctrine " began to " escalate into public debate as the influences of the Oxford Movement began to be felt in the Australian colonies " in the 1840s . 
 Allwood 's sermons were brief and Holy Communion was celebrated every Sunday . The organ , which had been installed in 1827 , was moved to the space of the southern vestry , and the pulpit and reading desk place in front of it where they could be seen from all parts of the church . The holy table continued to be located at the eastern end of the building . Bishop Broughton supported the Tractarian views of Allwood , but his successor , Frederic Barker , who became bishop in 1855 , was strongly Evangelical . The division in style between St James ' and the " low church " ethos that predominated in the Sydney Diocese began at this time . 
 = = = Changes : 1884 – 1904 = = = 
 During the 1880s Sydney became a prosperous city , commerce and industry flourished , and the suburbs expanded . As more churches were built and fewer people lived in the heart of the city , the congregation of St James ' Church shrank . The challenge that it faced was to minister effectively to city workers , rather than dwellers , to serve the poor of the city , and to attract those whose preference was for the style of worship and intellectual , topical preaching that distinguished St James ' from many of the newly created parish churches . The young Henry Latimer Jackson , from Cambridge , was appointed in 1885 . He introduced weekday services and a magazine called The <unk> , one of Australia 's first parish papers . He also lectured at Sydney University , addressed conferences , spoke at synod and acted as secretary to the newly established Sydney Church of England Boys ' Grammar School . However , his sermons were described as " not so much opposed , as simply not understood " . He resigned in 1895 after accepting a position in the Diocese of Ely . 
 Although Sydney was prospering , St James ' had an acute shortage of money and " the government considered resuming the site for a city railway " . The trustees at this time leased the parsonage and , in 1894 , used the money for urgent restoration to the exterior of the building . The architect Varney Parkes replaced the old spire , using copper that was pre @-@ weathered so that there was no radical change in its appearance . He removed infilling from the north portico and designed a new portico and entrance to the tower to match that of the eastern vestry . The result was to make the north face of the building its most significant aspect . 
 Jackson 's successor was William Carr Smith , a man with socialist ideals and a commitment to social reform and spiritual outreach . He preached long and engaging sermons inside the church and for a time in the open air in The Domain as well . Carr Smith had brought with him from England the " most recent developments " in the restoration of ancient liturgy , so he was able to help St James ' play a " notable part " in Sydney 's revival of Anglo @-@ Catholicism , setting " new standards of ceremonial " . To serve these purposes the architect John H. <unk> was employed to transform the building 's interior , completing the work in 1901 . The most significant change was the new emphasis given to the altar , which was made the focus of attention and " flanked by the pulpit , reading desks and lectern . " The " principal features " under the Carr Smith plan were the construction of the apse , set into the eastern vestry to create a sanctuary ; the raising of the chancel floor which created a platform , five steps above the nave for the choir , framed by the organ divided into two sections ; the making of a new , unobtrusive entrance to the tower and western gallery ; and the removal of the box pews and the eastern and northern galleries . The memorial plaques were also rearranged . The choir was ornamented with a mosaic floor and ornate brasswork which complemented the large brass eagle lectern by the English ecclesiastical suppliers , J. Wippell and Company , that commemorated Canon Robert Allwood . The floor of the pulpit was made from parts of the old three @-@ decker one . The organ , refurbished and enlarged by Davidson of Sydney , was installed in 1903 . With the removal of the organ , the south vestry was made into a side chapel . Eight large stained glass windows were installed between 1903 and 1913 , along with a new pulpit , altar and retable , all of which were given as memorials . Another improvement was " the placing of double windows on the King @-@ street side to shut out the sound of the traffic , which hitherto has been a serious annoyance to both the officiating clergymen and the congregation " . In 1897 , St James ' Hall was offered to Father <unk> <unk> , a Greek Orthodox priest from Samos for Orthodox services in Sydney . In 1904 the diocesan architect , John <unk> Clamp , was employed to design a new parish hall . 
 = = = 20th century = = = 
 In 1900 , the Governor , Earl Beauchamp , presented to the church a number of embroidered <unk> made by the Warham Guild of London , along with copes and <unk> . The centenary of the laying of the foundation stone was celebrated in October 1919 with a program of events that extended over nine days . Festivities included services at which the Bishops of Armidale and Bathurst were special preachers , music , processions , a lantern lecture on " Old Sydney " by the municipal librarian , and social events such as a ferry outing and a luncheon at which the chief guest was the Governor Sir Walter Davidson accompanied by his wife Lady Davidson . Also scheduled was a welcome to soldiers returned from the Great War . An illustrated historical memoir was produced and sold for two shillings . 
 The celebrations for the centenary of the Oxford Movement occurred during the tenure of the eighth rector of St James ' , Philip Micklem . However , " they were not centred on the cathedral , but on St James ' " , Sydney being the only Australian diocese that " failed officially to observe the occasion " . Micklem chaired a rally on 19 July 1933 in St James ' Hall that was attended by governor Philip Game and Lady Game , " and five bishops representing three states . " The 180th anniversary of the Oxford Movement fell in the 21st century , and the rector of St James ' preached at the commemoration . 
 Micklem was " a pioneer advocate of the preservation of early colonial architecture " . As the century progressed , there were a number of threats to the church 's historic environment , which includes Greenway 's Law Courts and Hyde Park Barracks . In spite of the threats to these colonial era buildings , they survived to form an important Sydney precinct . Both the building and the organisation continued to serve the city . During World War II , for example , the crypt was used as a " Hostel for Soldiers , Sailors and Airmen " and the ninth rector , Edwin John Davidson , incumbent during that period , " gained fame " for the church with his " pungent sermons on current affairs " . The eleventh rector , Frank <unk> , had an ecumenical outlook – he was a member of a meeting of the World Council of Churches at Uppsala and an observer to the Second Vatican Council . 
 St James ' was the locus of many notable events throughout the 20th century , including weddings and funerals of famous , significant or notorious people , visits from theologians and senior clerics , and when needed , services for the Lutheran communities . At the wedding of singer Gladys Moncrieff and Tom Moore on 20 May 1924 , the crowd in the streets nearby was so large that traffic was brought to a standstill , several women fell and two were so badly hurt they were taken to hospital . At the time Moncrieff was appearing in The Merry Widow and returned to the stage on the night of her wedding . St James ' was represented in the opening ceremonies of the Sydney Harbour Bridge by a float in the form of the church building . The church was " packed to the doors " when the seventh rector , W.F. Wentworth @-@ <unk> , officiated at the " impressive funeral " of Walter Liberty Vernon in 1914 . In 1950 , four thousand people were reported to have lined the streets after the State funeral at St. James ' of the first Minister for Sweden in Australia , Constans Lundquist , who died suddenly at the Swedish Legation in Sydney . Controversial former Governor @-@ General , Sir John Kerr had a private funeral and memorial service in St James ' in 1991 rather than a State funeral because of his fall from favour as the result of his decision to sack the Whitlam government in 1975 . Delivering the sermon at St James ' during an ecumenical event on 14 October 1993 , Archbishop Desmond Tutu thanked Australians for supporting the struggle against apartheid . 
 During the 20th century both choral and organ musical components developed to a high standard and were integral to the liturgy at St James ' . In addition , music was offered to the wider community in the form of recitals , often in ways that elucidate the liturgy and take advantage of church acoustics and sacred settings . Weekday recitals , such as the organ recitals given in 1936 of music by Bach , continued in addition to the music played on Sundays . 
 = = = 21st century = = = 
 In the 21st century , St James ' continues its work in the city centre via its ministry and engagement in the issues of the day . In the 19th century , there were controversies about <unk> ; in the 20th , there was the impact of the two world wars ; in the 21st century , the church has confronted the difficult and topical issues of violence , euthanasia , refugees , marriage and sexuality . The church 's relationship with government and the legal community began when the colony was under military government and the Church of England was the established church . Due to the church 's history and its proximity to the convict barracks ( later an immigration centre ) , the law courts ( both the old and the new ones ) as well as the New South Wales parliament , the relationship continues . It is evident in special services attended by the governor as well as the annual service to mark the opening of the law term . 
 St James ' commitment to social justice and education began in the 19th century with efforts to serve both convicts and settlers . It continued in the 20th with support for people affected by war , for example , when the church became " a busy centre of war @-@ time life " . Since early in the 20th century , service to the community has included visits to those imprisoned or ill as well as practical help to the city 's homeless and an annual schedule of educational seminars at the St James ' Institute . 
 On 6 February 2012 , the rector Andrew <unk> officiated at a thanksgiving for Queen Elizabeth II to mark the sixtieth anniversary of her accession to the throne in a service attended by the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Sydney , Cardinal George Pell and the Governor of New South Wales , Marie Bashir and on 9 September 2015 , when Queen Elizabeth II became the longest @-@ serving British monarch and Queen of Australia , there was a special Choral Evensong service to give thanks . At the Jubilee service , the Chief Justice of New South Wales , Tom Bathurst , read the first lesson and the service concluded with the Australian National Anthem and an organ postlude of Edward Elgar 's Pomp and Circumstance March No. 4 . On 23 March 2012 , a memorial service for Margaret Whitlam , wife of former Prime Minister of Australia , Gough Whitlam , was attended by Prime Minister Julia Gillard , and several former prime ministers . 
 = = Description = = 
 = = = Architecture = = = 
 One of Greenway 's finest works , St James ' is listed on the Register of the National estate and has been called an " architectural gem " and was featured by Dan Cruickshank in the BBC television series Around the World in 80 Treasures From 1966 to 1993 the spire of St James ' appeared on the Australian Australian ten @-@ dollar note among other Greenway buildings . In 1973 , the church appeared on a 50 cent postage stamp , one of four in a series illustrating Australian architecture issued to commemorate the opening of the Sydney Opera House . The Old Supreme Court Building next to the church is of the same date . Across the square is Greenway 's " masterpiece " Hyde Park Barracks , designed to align with the church . Beside the barracks stands Sydney 's oldest public building , part of the General Hospital built in 1811 and now known as the Mint Building . Separated from the Mint by the present @-@ day Sydney Hospital is Parliament House , Sydney , of which the central section is a further part of the early hospital , and is now home to the New South Wales State Parliament . 
 The church was constructed between 1820 and 1824 with later additions made in 1834 by John Verge who designed the vestries at the eastern end . Apart from these vestries , which retain the established style and proportions , the church externally remains " fine Georgian " much as Greenway conceived it . Relying on the " virtues of simplicity and proportion to achieve his end " , Greenway maintained the classical tradition , unaffected by the Revivalist styles that were being promoted in London at the time he arrived in the colony . He planned the church to align with his earlier Hyde Park Barracks , constructed in 1817 – 19 . The two buildings have similar proportions , pilasters and gables and together constitute an important example of town @-@ planning . Before the advent of high @-@ rise buildings , the 150 foot spire used to " serve as a guide for mariners coming up Port Jackson " . 
 St James ' originally took the form of a simple rectangular block , without transepts or chancel , with a tower at the western end and a classical portico of the Doric order on either side . To this has been added Verge 's vestry framed by two small porticos , and a similar portico as an entrance to the tower . The church is built of local brick , its walls divided by brick pilasters into a series of bays . The walls are pierced by large windows with round arched heads in a colour that separates and defines them against the walls . The roof carries over the end walls with the gable forming triangular pediments of classical proportions carrying a cornice across the eaves line . Thus the architectural treatment on the side walls is continued around the end walls . 
 = = = Interior = = = 
 The original interior differed greatly in layout from that of the present . There was no structural chancel , the focus of the church being a large pulpit . During the mid 19th century galleries overlooked the pulpit from three sides . Of the original galleries , only the western one of Australian Red Cedar remains in place . The coffered ceiling ( an addition from 1882 replacing the original lath and plaster ceiling ) , the low @-@ backed pews ( from shortly after ) and the predominantly classical memorials all contribute to the present interior retaining the character of a Georgian church . 
 At the eastern end , the communion table is set into a small apse with its semi @-@ dome adorned with gold mosaic tiles that were added in 1960 . The altar is a commemorative gift from the Lloyd family , whose son was the first server appointed at St James ' . It generally has an altar frontal in the colour of the liturgical season or festival . With no structural choir area , the chancel is built out and into the body of the church as a platform enclosed within gated wrought iron and brass railings and approached by steps . The mosaic floor of the chancel is ornately with designs showing the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit ( Wisdom , Understanding , Counsel , Ghostly Strength , Knowledge , Godliness and Holy Fear ) along with symbols of St James the Great ( the staff , scrip , palm , scallop shell and hat of the pilgrim ) . The chancel is framed on either side by the organ pipes . 
 There are five large stained glass windows on the northern and southern walls and additional windows in the stairwell to the belltower and on the western wall . Most of them are designed by Percy Bacon Brothers and the majority were donated as memorials by parishioners in the period from 1900 to 1910 . The stained glass fanlight depicting James and John , the sons of Zebedee , was designed by Australian artist Norman Carter in 1930 . The window behind the baptismal font , depicting Christ with the Children , was repaired and rededicated in 2004 by the fifteenth rector in the presence of the then Primate , Peter Carnley . 
 = = = Chapel of the Holy Spirit = = = 
 Previously enclosed and used as a vestry and then an organ chamber , the south porch became a chapel in 1903 . In 1988 , the side chapel was remodelled and dedicated as the Chapel of the Holy Spirit . The parish and the Bicentennial Council of New South Wales funded the redesign which saw the removal of the infilling from between the columns of the portico and its replacement with stained glass . The award @-@ winning " Creation Window " , designed by Australian artist David Wright , spreads across the three walls and represents the interaction of earth , air , fire and water , symbolic of the action of the Spirit in creation , in life and in rebirth in Christ . The new furniture for the chapel was designed by Leon <unk> . 
 = = = Crypt and Children 's Chapel = = = 
 Beneath the church is a large undercroft , built of brick and groin vaulted . It has been used for many purposes : as a residence by Revd Hill 's widow and later by a <unk> ; by Canon Allwood as a part @-@ time bedroom ; for the parish 's schools ; and as a shelter by Australian , American and British armed forces during the two world wars . Rector Francis Wentworth @-@ <unk> gave the city parish " a big role as a drop @-@ in centre for servicemen " during the First World War . During the Second World War bed and bedding were provided to over 30 @,@ 000 Allied servicemen . 
 The western bay on the south side of the crypt is the Chapel of St Mary and the Angels , better known simply as the " Children 's Chapel " . It was opened in 1929 as a chapel for younger children . A specially adapted form of Eucharist is celebrated there on the first Sunday of the month . All four walls of the chapel and its ceiling are decorated with murals designed by the writer and artist Ethel Anderson and executed by the Turramurra Wall Painters Union , a group of Modernist painters she founded in 1927 . The murals underwent extensive conservation in 1992 – 1993 . 
 The crypt was restored by Geoffrey Danks in 1977 – 78 . In the 21st century , the bays on either side of the crypt 's central corridor are used for a variety of purposes . At the eastern end they house a commercial kitchen . Some bays are used as offices ; one ( The Chapel of All Souls ) contains a columbarium ; another houses a lending library for parishioners . 
 = = = Memorials , monuments , records = = = 
 St James ' provides a record of important elements of Sydney 's history in both physical and documentary form . There are over 300 memorials commemorating important members of 19th century colonial society , people who served the colony generally and parishioners from the 20th century . In addition , many of the stained glass windows and items of furniture have been donated as memorials . For example , the large stained glass window of Saint George on the northern wall is a memorial to Keith Kinnaird Mackellar , who died in the Second Boer War aged 20 . He was the brother of poet Dorothea Mackellar . These memorials are the reason the church was sometimes called " The Westminster Abbey of the South " . As early as 1876 , the wall tablets were described as " full of sad memories to the old inhabitants , interesting reminiscences to those who have studied Australian history " . 
 The first monument erected in the church was the memorial to Commodore Sir James Brisbane , who died in Sydney on his way to serve in South America in command of HMS Warspite . It was sculpted by Sir Francis Chantrey , sent to Sydney by Lady Brisbane and installed in the church in 1830 . The Brisbane memorial began the tradition of memorial tablets to " prominent people " . The memorial to Robert Wardell in 1834 rendered " bushranger " into Latin as " a <unk> <unk> <unk> " . Four other monuments were installed between 1830 and 1839 . The only memorial on which an indigenous Australian appears is that of Edmund Kennedy ( said to have been " a communicant at St James ’ " ) on whose tablet Jackey Jackey is remembered . There are memorials to the Macleay family of naturalists , Alexander and William Sharp Macleay . The largest single memorial of the 20th century is the war memorial , to the design of Hardy Wilson , dedicated on 14 June 1922 . It commemorates more than 50 men associated with St James ' who were killed in the First World War , throughout which the roll of honour was regularly read during the Eucharist . In 2014 , St James ' was part of a series of commemorations of the bicentenary of the death of the colony 's first Governor , Arthur Phillip . On 31 August , a memorial plaque , similar in form to one placed in the nave of Westminster Abbey on 9 July , was unveiled by the 37th Governor , Marie Bashir . 
 The church has all its baptismal and marriage registers dating from 1824 to the present day . These were originally handwritten ; printed forms came into existence " by government order " in 1826 . Since it was not compulsory to register births , deaths and marriages until after 1855 , the records held by St James ' are particularly valuable to historians and genealogists and copies are held in the National Library of Australia . 
 = = = Renovation , restoration , conservation = = = 
 Since its erection , the building has undergone significant repair , renovation and conservation , including work on the building fabric , the stained glass windows , the mosaic floors in the chancel and sanctuary and conservation of the Children 's Chapel . Major work was done on the interior and the spire in the 1890s and on the crypt in the 1970s . 
 The spire was extensively restored from 2008 to 2010 , including the tower masonry , the interior framing , the copper covering and the orb and cross . The spire was rededicated on 20 October 2010 . The restorations were awarded the National Trust of Australia Built Heritage Award on 4 April 2011 and the AIA Greenway Award for Heritage . The jury said that the restoration work showed " consummate care by the architect , the engineer and the builder in conserving the original structure and fabric of the building , improving its strength , performance and waterproofing " . 
 Restoration continued with work on the church 's slate roof and sandstone perimeter fence . The Spanish slates , installed in the 1970s , proved not to be durable in Sydney 's climate due to their high iron content and their poor fixing had resulted in further damage . The solution to the deterioration was to replace the slates using Welsh slates . The roof project was completed after a fund @-@ raising effort supported by the National Trust of Australia . In 2013 , the interior was repainted after preparation that involved " colour testing and selection , memorial protection and ceiling acoustic repairs " . As a heritage @-@ listed building , the church has a program of continual conservation . Its custodians remain " ever mindful " of their responsibility to the wider public as well as to the congregation . 
 = = Worship and ministry = = 
 = = = Liturgy = = = 
 St James ' offers three <unk> on Sundays : a Said Eucharist , a Sung Eucharist and a Choral Eucharist . There is a regular Choral Evensong on Wednesdays and one Sunday each month . The Eucharist and other services are also celebrated during the week and the robed choir contributes to its " cathedral style worship " . Festival services are popular and known for their standard of liturgy and music , particularly those services which celebrate high points of the church year such as Holy Week and Easter , the Advent carols , the Nine Lessons and Carols , the Christmas Eve Midnight Mass and the patronal festival of St James ( son of Zebedee , also known as James the Great ) in July . A series of orchestral Masses is held in January . 
 St James ' continues to maintain a formal and sacramental liturgy and has weathered the storm of criticism from a diocese with increasingly " Low church " practices . It is one of the few Sydney Anglican churches that has upheld the norms of mainstream Anglican tradition , including the use of the stole by clergy during services , especially during sacraments such as baptisms and marriages ; the Book of Common Prayer and sacred church music , including the singing of hymns from a hymnal . 
 = = = Theology = = = 
 The Constitution of the Anglican Church of Australia " commit [ s ] Anglicans to mainstream Christian orthodoxy " , but its ruling principles direct it to that particular tradition within as " represented by the Church of England " . The Australian church had to work out the meaning of its common heritage " in the context of the different cultures of the separate colonies " but " the way in which that faith pedigree was appealed to and interpreted ... has highlighted differences . " Peter Carnley , former primate of the Anglican Church of Australia , has described Anglicanism 's " unique or essential identity " as having " not so much a body of theological teaching , as a style of theological reflection " that goes back to the Elizabethan theologian Richard Hooker . St James ' conforms to this Anglican tradition , part of which is a general dislike of what used to be referred to as ' Enthusiasm ' : that is , a dislike of " pious individualism and emotional exuberance " . St James ' theological position in the liturgy is evidently consistent with Carnley 's explanation that <unk> reality " might be experienced with the aid of aesthetic , symbolic or sacramental aids to worship . " Such an adherence to the importance of the sacred and the sublime in worship remains in sharp contradistinction to practice in the surrounding mostly evangelical diocese , which typically eschews beauty and holds to an " ultra @-@ low ecclesiastical aesthetic " that is combined with " ultra @-@ conservative social values " . Teaching at St James ' takes account of both the Biblical and contemporary historical context . In the Sydney diocese , St James 's differing view has therefore been controversial since the 19th century as the various rectors led the church towards and away from Anglo @-@ Catholicism . Micklem , for example , renewed Anglo @-@ Catholic churchmanship and Davidson " returned it firmly to a moderate position " . 
 St James ' aims to be " an open and inclusive Christian community " that " welcomes all , regardless of age , race , sexual orientation or religion " . During the long debate in the diocese about the acceptability of women as priests and also as preachers , for example , women clergy were welcome . One of the first women ordained as a priest in the Anglican Church in Australia , the Revd Susanna Pain , served as a deacon at St James ' and women in leadership positions in the Anglican Church such as Bishops Kay Goldsworthy and <unk> Blackwell , have been invited to preach . The current rector contributes to the public debate about the role and responsibilities of the church in a secularised world and in response to statements about same @-@ sex marriage from the Archbishop of Sydney , published a dissenting view . 
 = = = Congregation = = = 
 In the beginning , convicts , soldiers , governors and civil authorities attended the church ; in the 21st century , regular patronage by , and programs for , governors , politicians , the legal community and the homeless create a similarly diverse mix . In 1900 , such a congregation was described by the sixth rector as representing " many types , many classes . Here we find rich and poor , old and new , the Governor and the Domain loafer , the passing visitor , and the grandchildren of those whose memorial tablets testify to a long connection with the church . " William Carr Smith 's observation was that " this makes the congregation a difficult one to handle . " 
 Nevertheless , the congregation provides volunteer labour and donates funds for many of church 's activities , including laundry work , library administration , flower arrangements , bell ringing , singing in the parish choir and hospitality for the Sister Freda mission . Furnishings for the chapel in the Sydney Hospital were provided by the parishioners during Carr Smith 's time , when he became chaplain to the hospital . 
 = = = Community service = = = 
 St James ' work for the poor , as well as for the city 's legal and medical professions , has been continuous from the 19th century . Since early times work " for the poor of the parish " ; the promotion of " overseas and inland missions " ; liaison with " the city professions in law and medicine " and running " devotional and discussion groups " has been incorporated into the church 's mission . In the 20th century , the ninth and tenth rectors emphasised " the church 's responsibility to society " and encouraged St James ' role in the city . In the 21st century , these activities have been supplemented by chaplaincy and professional counselling services directed at dealing with the problems associated with the stresses of city life . 
 The " most direct part of St James ' social welfare work " is the Sister Freda Mission , which began in 1899 . Among other things , this ministry provides weekly lunches to the needy and a full dinner at Christmas . Sister Freda ( Emily Rich ) was a member of the Community of the Sisters of the Church , a religious order which started the Collegiate School in Paddington in 1895 . Sister Freda and other members of the order took over the organisation of its mission to the homeless in 1899 . On Christmas Day in 1901 " about 60 men were entertained at dinner at St James ' parish hall , and later in the afternoon 250 unemployed men were treated to tea in the same building by the sisters of the church . " After her death in 1936 , Sister Freda 's name was given to the mission and St James ' took over responsibility for its organisation . Since 1954 , this service has operated out of the church crypt , relying on donations , including food sourced by <unk> , and the efforts of volunteer parishioners . 
 The church 's ministry to Sydney 's legal fraternity is facilitated by its proximity to buildings used by the profession , including the Law Courts , which is the main building of the Supreme Court of New South Wales and houses the Sydney registry of the High Court of Australia ; the College of Law and the St James Campus of the University of Sydney , which is the former home of Sydney Law School , still mainly used for legal education by the university . Phillip Street , which runs north from the church , is home to a large number of barristers ' chambers as well as the Law Society of New South Wales . 
 Due to this proximity , the church and legal profession have a longstanding relationship , anchored by an annual service to mark the beginning of the legal year which is attended by judges , solicitors and members of the Bar from the Supreme Court of New South Wales in ceremonial attire . In the 19th century , the relationship was reported in the context of delays to the law and concerns about the need for a suitable set of new courts . In the 20th , it was noted that the " relationship of law and religion " was one of " two co @-@ operating forces , approaching , from different sides , a problem which was common to them both of securing right conduct " ; and in the 21st century , the Governor still attends special services . Since 1950 , there has also been an annual service for the members of the Order of St Michael and St George . 
 = = = Education = = = 
 In the 19th century , religious denominations made a major contribution to education at all levels before this was taken over by the state . From its beginnings , St James ' was involved in education for both children and adults . Richard Hill , the first minister , " began Australia 's first kindergarten and William Cape managed a school based on new educational principles " . Hill worked with the Benevolent Society , the Bible Society , Aboriginals , the Hospital , " various convict establishments and a range of schools , " including Industrial Schools . By 1823 Greenway 's school building had been erected in Elizabeth Street and the principal St James ' School was situated there until 1882 , becoming the Anglican " normal " school with more than 600 students and a range of experienced teachers . In secondary education , a Sydney branch of the King 's School operated briefly in the Greenway building and Bishop Broughton operated the St James ' Grammar School in a building erected in Phillip Street . The Grammar School , presided over by the Revd C. Kemp was described as " of inestimable value to the then youth of the colony " . Bishop Broughton also set up St James ' College to provide tertiary education for secular students as well as to prepare students for ordination . The St James ' School closed in 1882 and the government resumed the Greenway building . Tuition for the students of St Paul 's College , University of Sydney was originally provided in the vestry of St James ' . 
 In the 20th century , St James ' developed its education program for children and adults and continued them in the 21st century . A Sunday school for children is held in the crypt . Educational activities for adults are offered through the St James ' Institute which provides a range of programs open to all to explore the Christian faith and engage in debate about contemporary issues from a theological perspective . For example , in 2012 , the Institute hosted a seminar on " Women in the Australian Church : Untold Stories " in conjunction with the International Women 's Network and <unk> . In 2013 , there was a meeting of " deans and ministers from Anglican churches that serve the business districts in major cities around world " to discuss the churches ' response to the Global Financial Crisis . 
 = = = Past and present clergy = = = 
 The Reverend Samuel Marsden delivered the first sermon on 6 July 1824 . In 1836 the first ( and only ) Bishop of Australia , William Grant Broughton , was installed at St James ' as there was still no cathedral . Broughton regularly officiated at St James ' as at the first ordination of an Anglican priest in Australia ( the Revd T. Sharpe ) on 17 December 1836 . 
 The rector of St James ' is assisted by associate rectors ( it was not until the 1890s that the title " rector " was used ) . The current ( sixteenth ) rector is the Reverend Andrew <unk> and the associate rector is the Reverend John Stewart . 
 = = Music = = 
 St James ' has had a strong musical and choral tradition " integral " to its liturgies since the 1820s and is known both for the high standard of the sacred music as well as for its regular public recitals and concerts . St James ' has a choir , a fine three @-@ manual pipe organ and a peal of bells hung for change ringing . Isaac Nathan , who " constituted himself musical laureate to the colony " and is considered " Australia 's first composer " , created a musical society at St James ' in the 1840s . 
 = = = Organ = = = 
 The original organ , installed in the west gallery , was built by John Gray of London and was played for the first time on 7 October 1827 . It received the following praise in the colonial newspaper The Australian . 
 " St. James 's new organ <unk> its notes of praise for the first time at noon service on Sunday , to an overflowing congregation , more numerous perhaps than any congregation St. James 's had ever before witnessed . The organ was not in perfect harmony , owing , in a great measure , to its yet incomplete state . Its intonations , however , in many instances , was full , rich , and harmonious , and those of the congregation were not a few who felt its tones swell on the ear like the welcome voice of a long parted friend ! " 
 The organ was modernised and enlarged in the 1870s by William Davidson . After a number of moves around the galleries , it was placed in what had been intended as the south porch . At the time the church 's interior was reconstructed at the turn of the 20th century , it was positioned on either side of the chancel platform at the eastern end where it remains . Organ specialists Hill , Norman & Beard ( Aust ) Pty Ltd gave the organ a major refurbishment and reconstruction between 1970 and 1971 at a cost of $ 35 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = Choir = = = 
 St James ' has had a choir since early colonial times . James Pearson accepted the office of choir leader in 1827 and arranged some of the music that was sung . He also offered to teach " a few steady persons , of either sex , " if they would volunteer to join the choir . In those early days , the choir was a " mixed one , of male and female voices , some of them professional " , but by the end of the 19th century , the choristers were all males . Until Anthony Jennings was appointed Director of Music in 1995 , the choirmaster was also the organist . Some choirmasters , such as James Furley , also composed original works for the choir . Arthur Mason , chief organist at the turn of the 20th century , was succeeded by George Faunce Allman in the role . 
 The current choir is composed of about a dozen semi @-@ professional adults . They sing on Sundays at the 11 @.@ 00 am Choral Eucharist , Wednesdays at the 6 : 15 pm Choral Evensong , monthly at the 3 @.@ 00 pm Choral Evensong held on the last Sunday of the month , as well as at a number of midweek feast days held during the year . In January , during the summer holiday period , St James ' presents three full orchestral Masses during which liturgical music by composers such as Mozart , Haydn and Schubert is used for its original purpose and incorporated into the service . On these occasions , the choir is joined by a small orchestra . 
 On occasion , the St James ' choir has combined with other choirs , such as when it joined the Sydney Philharmonia Motet Choir or the choir of St Mary 's Cathedral to present Monteverdi 's Vespers in 2013 . It has recorded CDs and premiered new works by composers such as Ann Carr @-@ Boyd and Gordon Kerry , as well as new arrangements of traditional works . They have also performed with international touring groups such as with the Tallis Scholars ' Summer School ; broadcast on ABC Radio , both in their own right as well as with leading ensembles such as Australian Baroque Brass . 
 Musical critique of the choir has appeared in the press from the beginning and continues to the present day . In 1827 , one singer was criticised for her diction : " If her pronunciation were as pleasing as her notes , she would be entitled to unqualified praise " wrote a critic in 1827 . In 1845 , St James ' was being described as the " exception " to the prevailing low standard of church music in both England and New South Wales . In 2013 , singers from the combined choirs of St James ' and St Mary 's Cathedral were appraised as creating " a clear , well @-@ defined edge that swirled gloriously " .

 = Stork Club = 
 The Stork Club was a nightclub in Manhattan , New York City , which during its existence from 1929 to 1965 was one of the most prestigious clubs in the world . A symbol of café society , the wealthy elite , including movie stars , celebrities , showgirls , and aristocrats all mixed in the VIP Cub Room of the club . 
 The club was established on West 58th Street in 1929 by Sherman Billingsley , a former bootlegger from Enid , Oklahoma . After an incident when Billingsley was kidnapped and held for ransom by Mad Dog Coll , a rival of his mobster partners , he became the sole owner of the Stork Club . The club remained at its original location until it was raided by Prohibition agents in 1931 . After the raid , it moved to East 51st Street . From 1934 until its closure in 1965 , it was located at 3 East 53rd Street , just east of Fifth Avenue , when it became world @-@ renowned with its celebrity clientele and luxury . Billingsley was known for his lavish gifts , which brought a steady stream of celebrities to the club and also insured that those interested in the famous would have a reason to visit . 
 Until World War II , the club consisted of a dining room and bar with rest rooms on upper floors with many mirrors and fresh flowers throughout . Billingsley originally built the well @-@ known Cub Room as a private place where he could play cards with friends . Described as a " lopsided oval " , the room had wood paneled walls hung with portraits of beautiful women and had no windows . A head waiter known as " Saint Peter " determined who was allowed entry to the Cub Room , where Walter Winchell wrote his columns and broadcast his radio programs from Table 50 . 
 During the years of its operation , the club was visited by many political , social and celebrity figures . It counted among its guests the Kennedy and Roosevelt families , and The Duke and Duchess of Windsor . The news of Grace Kelly 's engagement to Prince Rainier of Monaco broke while the couple was visiting the Stork Club . Socialite Evalyn Walsh McLean , owner of the Hope Diamond , once lost the gem under a Stork Club table during an evening visit to the club . Ernest Hemingway was able to cash his $ 100 @,@ 000 check for the film rights of For Whom the Bell Tolls at the Stork Club to settle his bill . 
 In the 1940s , workers of the Stork Club desired to be represented by a union , and by 1957 , the employees of all similar New York venues were union members . However , Billingsley was still unwilling to allow his help to organize , which led to union supporters picketing in front of the club for many years until its closure . During this time , many of the club 's celebrity and non @-@ celebrity guests stopped visiting the Stork Club ; it closed in 1965 and was demolished the following year . The site is now the location of Paley Park , a small vest @-@ pocket park .

 = = = Early history = = = 
 The Stork Club was owned and operated by Sherman Billingsley ( 1896 – 1966 ) an ex @-@ bootlegger who came to New York from Enid , Oklahoma . The Stork Club first opened in 1929 at 132 West 58th Street , just down the street from Billingsley 's apartment at 152 West 58th Street . Billingsley 's hand @-@ written recollections of the early days recall that he was approached by two gamblers he knew from Oklahoma in his New York real estate office , proposing to open a restaurant together , which he accepted . The origin of the name of the club is unknown ; Billingsley once remarked , " Don 't ask me how or why I picked the name , because I just don 't remember . " New York City 's El Morocco had the sophistication and Toots Shor 's drew the sporting crowd , but the Stork Club mixed power , money and glamor . Unlike its competitors , the Stork stayed open on Sunday nights and during the summer months . 
 One of the first Stork Club customers was writer Heywood Broun , who resided in the vicinity . Broun 's first visit to the Stork was actually made by mistake ; he believed it to be a funeral home , but he soon became a regular , and invited his celebrity friends , as the name of the club spread further afield . Before long , Billingsley 's Oklahoma partners sold their shares to a man named Thomas Healy . Eventually Mr. Healy revealed that he was a " front " for three New York mobsters . Billingsley was kidnapped and held for ransom by Mad Dog Coll , who was a rival of his mob partners . Before the ransom money could be collected by Coll , he was lured to a telephone booth where he was shot to death . After the incident , the secret gangster partners reluctantly allowed Billingsley to buy them out for $ 30 @,@ 000 . 
 Another New York nightclub owner , Tex Guinan , introduced Billingsley to her friend , the entertainment and gossip columnist Walter Winchell in 1930 . In September 1930 , Winchell called the Stork Club " New York 's New <unk> place on W. 58th " in his New York Daily Mirror column . That evening , the Stork Club was filled with moneyed guests . Someone else who read Winchell 's column in 1930 was singer @-@ actress Helen Morgan , who had just finished filming a movie on Long Island . Morgan decided to hold a cast party at the Stork Club , paying the tab with two $ 1 @,@ 000 bills . Winchell became a regular at the Stork Club ; what he saw and heard there at his private Table 50 was the basis of his newspaper columns and radio broadcasts . Billingsley also kept professionals on his staff whose job was to listen to the chatter , determine fact from rumor , and then report the factual news to local columnists . The practice was seen as protective of the patrons by shielding them from unfounded reports , and also a continual source of publicity for the club . Billingsley 's long @-@ standing relationship with Ethel Merman which began in 1939 , brought the theater crowd to the Stork ; there she had a waiter assigned to her whose job was just to light her cigarettes . Billingsley later wrote that Merman had offered him $ 500 @,@ 000 to leave his wife and that he turned down the offer . 
 Prohibition agents closed the original club on December 22 , 1931 , and Billingsley moved it to East 51st Street for three years . It was raided in August 1932 at the 51st Street location after an angry patron lost a quarter in a coin machine and notified police . The police asked guests to quietly pay their checks and leave the building ; this took two hours . In 1934 , the Stork Club moved to 3 East 53rd Street , where it remained until it closed in October 1965 . Billingsley 's guest list for the 53rd Street opening consisted of people from Broadway and Park Avenue . He sent out 1 @,@ 000 invitations for champagne and dinner . The women found much to like about the fresh flowers everywhere and the mirrored walls , while the men were pleased to see their favorite dishes on the club 's menu as well as many of their personal and business friends at the opening . When the Stork Club became a tenant in 1934 , the building was known as the Physicians and Surgeons Building . Many of the medical tenants were unhappy about the night club moving in , but in February 1946 , Billingsley purchased the seven story building for $ 300 @,@ 000 cash , evicting the doctors to expand the club . 
 By 1936 , the Stork was doing well enough to have a million dollar gross for the first time . Young debutante Brenda Frazier made her first visit to the Stork Club in the spring of 1938 ; she became a regular , bringing many young people from the society set with her . Billingsley welcomed young people who were not old enough to drink . He encouraged them to gather at the Stork Club by inviting debutantes to the club and holding a yearly " <unk> Girl " election . As the father of three daughters , Billingsley kept an eye on the young people , making sure they were not served alcohol and that they were able to have an enjoyable time at the Stork Club without it . 
 The Stork Club previously provided live entertainment but after Billingsley realized the reason people came to the club was to watch people , he abandoned the floor shows in favor of giving expensive gifts to regular customers of the club . A live band was provided in the main dining room for dancing . Billingsley had a keen sense for business . Before he purchased the building the Stork Club was in , the yearly rent for the space it occupied was $ 12 @,@ 000 . Billingsley rented out the hat and coat check area to a separate concession for $ 27 @,@ 000 a year . This paid the rent for the Stork Club , leaving $ 15 @,@ 000 annually to cover bad checks . When Ernest Hemingway wanted to pay his bill with a $ 100 @,@ 000 check he received for the movie rights to For Whom the Bell Tolls , Billingsley told him he would be able to cash the check after the club closed at 4am . He kept the Stork Club 's name vivid in the minds of his patrons through mailing lists and a club news letter . Billingsley was also aware of the need for a good working relationship with the press ; food and drink for reporters and photographers assigned to cover the Stork Club were on the house .

 In early 1944 , New York mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia ordered a check on the books of all major city night clubs . City tax accountants soon investigated the Stork Club , the Copacabana and other city night spots . By July , auditors turned in a report claiming that the clubs were overcharging patrons on tax , sending the city the proper amount and keeping the <unk> sums . On a Saturday in July , city officials arrived at the Stork Club with a court order granting permission for them to seize the club 's property for the amount which was claimed to be overcharged as taxes , plus penalties . The total for the Stork Club was $ 181 @,@ 000 . Billingsley , out of town with his family , was notified . The club 's employees refused to turn anything over to the officials , who were intent on closing it . Upon his return , Billingsley firmly protested that the Stork Club did not owe the city any money and was up to date on its tax payments . A compromise was reached : the club could stay open as long as a custodian for the city was allowed to be on the premises . Billingsley was eventually able to get a court order to eject the custodian , but the case dragged on for five years , costing Billingsley $ 100 @,@ 000 . 
 On October 19 , 1951 , Josephine Baker made charges of racism against the Stork Club . Baker visited the club on October 16 as the guest of Roger Rico and his wife ; both entertainers were at the Stork after their theater performances . Baker said she ordered a steak and was apparently still waiting for it an hour later . The controversy grew when Baker accused Walter Winchell of being in the Cub Room at the time and not coming to her aid . Winchell was at the club ; he said he had greeted Baker and vocalist Roger Rico as the two left their Cub Room table . Winchell said he was not aware of there being any problem , and left for a late screening of the film The Desert Fox . The next morning , Winchell 's rumored failure to assist Baker was big news , and he received countless telephone calls . The incident blew into a major scandal and was widely publicized on the radio and newspapers . Mrs. Rico , who was part of the Baker party with her husband , said that Baker 's steak was waiting for her at the table after she returned from her phone call , but the entertainer chose to make a stormy exit from the Stork anyhow . News accounts show conflicting statements from the <unk> . 
 Along with that of Billingsley and the Stork Club , Walter Winchell 's name was further tarnished by the incident . After leaving the Stork , the Baker party made contact with WMCA 's Barry Gray , where the story was told as part of Gray 's radio talk show . One of those who phoned Gray 's program was television personality and columnist Ed Sullivan , a professional rival of Winchell 's whose " home base " was the El Morocco nightclub . Sullivan 's on @-@ air remarks dealt mainly with Winchell 's alleged part in the event , saying , " What Winchell has done is an insult to the United States and American newspaper men . " Winchell 's column of October 24 , 1951 provides the same details as earlier news stories about Josephine Baker 's accusations that he did not assist her at the Stork Club . Winchell also printed a letter he received from Walter White , who was the executive secretary for the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) at the time . A New York police investigation of the matter followed the complaint made by the NAACP . The police investigation found that the Stork Club did not discriminate against Josephine Baker . The NAACP went on to say that the results of the police investigation did not provide enough evidence for the organization to pursue the incident further in criminal court . Baker filed suit against Winchell over the matter , but the suit was dismissed in 1955 . Walter Winchell later said . " The Stork Club discriminates against everybody . White , black and pink . The Stork bars all kinds of people for all kinds of reasons . But if your skin is green and you 're rich and famous or you 're syndicated , you 'll be welcome at the club . " 
 Because of Billingsley 's long @-@ standing friendship with Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) head J. Edgar Hoover , rumors persisted that the Stork Club was bugged . During his work on the Stork Club book , author and New York Times reporter Ralph Blumenthal was contacted by Jean @-@ Claude Baker , one of Josephine Baker 's sons . Having read an article by Blumenthal about Leonard Bernstein 's FBI file , he indicated that he had read his mother 's FBI file and by comparing the file to the tapes , said he thought the Stork Club incident was overblown . 
 = = = Union issues and closure = = = 
 Hard times began for the Stork Club in 1956 , when it lost money for the first time . In 1957 , unions tried once again to organize the club 's employees . Their major effort ten years before had been unsuccessful ; at that time , Sherman Billingsley was accused of attempting to influence his employees to stay out of the union with lavish staff parties and financial gifts . By 1957 , all other similar New York clubs except the Stork Club were now unionized . This met with resistance from Billingsley and many dependable employees left the Stork Club over his refusal to allow them to be represented by a union . Picket lines were set up and marched in front of the club daily for years , including the club 's last day of business . The club received many threats connected to his refusal to accept unions for his workers ; some of the threats involved Billingsley 's family . In 1957 , he was arrested for displaying a gun when some painters who were working at the Austrian Consulate next to the family 's home sat on his stoop for lunch . Billingsley admitted to acting rashly because of the threats . Three months before his arrest , his secretary was assaulted as she was entering the building where she lived ; her assailants made references to the union issues at the Stork Club . 
 As a result of the union dispute , many club patrons no longer visited the night spot . Those who were performers were informed of the possibility of fines and suspensions by their respective unions for crossing the Stork Club picket line as the issue continued . Many of Billingsley 's friendships , including those of Walter Winchell and J. Edgar Hoover , were over as a result of the union problems . He began firing staff without good cause . As the dispute dragged on , there was also no longer a live band in the dining room for music ; members of the Musicians ' Union had crossed the picket line to perform for some time . Previously , the club had no need for advertising ; it was mentioned frequently in print and word of mouth without it . In 1963 , the club offered a hamburger and French fries for $ 1 @.@ 99 in a New York Times ad ; when those in the know about the club saw it , they realized the Stork Club 's days were coming to an end . In the last few months of its operation , at times there were only three customers for the entire evening . On a good day in the mid @-@ 1940s , some 2 @,@ 500 people visited the club . 
 When the Stork Club initially closed its doors , news stories indicated it was being shut because the building it occupied had been sold and a new location was being sought . The years of labor disputes had taken their toll on Billingsley financially . Trying to keep the Stork Club going took all of his assets and about $ 10 million from his three daughters ' trust funds . While in the hospital recuperating from a serious illness in October 1965 , Billingsley sold the building to Columbia Broadcasting System ( CBS ) , who later turned the site into a park named after its founder 's father . In a 1937 interview , Billingsley said , " I hope I 'll be running a night club the last day I live . " He fell just short of that mark . One year after the Stork Club closed , Sherman Billingsley died of a heart attack at his Manhattan apartment , leaving a wife , Hazel , and three daughters , Jacqueline , Barbara , and <unk> . He was planning on re @-@ opening the Stork Club in another location and was working on writing a book at the time of his death . 
 = = Interior = = 
 From the physical layout of the club , as described by Ed Sullivan in a 1939 column , the Stork should have been doomed to failure , since it was strangely shaped and far from roomy in places . The club 's ladies ' room was on the second floor of the structure and the men 's room was on the third ; only the dining room , bar , and later the Cub Room were on the first floor . Despite this , the club could hold 1 @,@ 000 guests . A feature of the club was a solid 14 karat gold chain at its entrance ; patrons were allowed entry through it by the doorman . When the East 53rd Street building came down to make way for Paley Park , one of the artifacts found in it was a still . The New York Historical Society displayed that along with other Stork Club items and memorabilia in an exhibit in 2000 . 
 Billingsley 's hospitality with food , drink , and gifts overcame the structural deficits to keep his patrons returning time after time . He maintained order through a series of hand signals ; without saying a word he could order complimentary drinks and gifts for a party at any given table . Billingsley was also able to summon the club 's private limousine to whisk favored customers away to a theater date or a ball game after drinks or dining at the Stork . He changed the meaning of the hand signals frequently to avoid regular patrons ' being able to read them . Guests dined on the finest wines and cuisine , and it was known for its champagne and caviar . The club gained worldwide attention for its cocktails , made by chief barman Nathaniel " Cookie " Cook . Cook invented dozens of cocktails at the bar , including the signature " Stork Club Cocktail " . Today the ornamental bar of the Stork Club is to be found in Jim Brady 's Bar in Maiden Lane . The dining room featured live bands for dancing ; the Benny Goodman orchestra were frequent performers . According to a 1960 Services Labor Report , the kitchen and dining room employees working in the Stork Club did " not enjoy the same wages , hours and working conditions " as the others , a primary factor which led the majority of them to the strike in January 1957 . 
 Besides the Cub Room , the Main Dining Room , and the bar , the club contained a room for parties , the " Blessed Event Room " , a large private room on the second floor with its own kitchen and bar , the " <unk> 's Room " , which was just past the Cub Room and much like a men 's club , and a private barber shop . When the Blessed Event Room was added to the Stork Club , its walls were entirely mirrored . Patrons who had rented the room for poker parties complained that the mirrors allowed players to see everyone 's hand of cards ; the mirrors were then removed from the walls . 
 = = = The Cub Room = = = 
 Billingsley 's original plan for the Cub Room was for it to be a private place for playing gin rummy with his friends . The room was added to the club during World War II . Billingsley broke out a wall in the bar to create this private space , but it was Walter Winchell who began to call it the Cub Room . The Cub Room had no windows and was described in a Louis Sobol column as a " lopsided oval " . The room was lit with pink tones . On the wood @-@ paneled walls were paintings of beautiful women ; Billingsley also had similar portraits by the same artist in the Ladies ' powder room . After the club 's labor problems began in 1957 , Billingsley redecorated the entire club , choosing emerald green for the carpet and chairs , and a pinkish @-@ red for the banquettes . The Cub Room 's wood panels were replaced by beige burlap and the portraits of beautiful women were replaced by paintings of noted 19th @-@ century race horses . As a concession to those who wanted to have a business lunch at The Stork , the Cub Room was for men only during lunch time . The sanctum sanctorum , the Cub Room ( " the snub room " ) , was guarded by a captain called " Saint Peter " ( for the saint who guards the gates of Heaven ) . 
 The most famous of the Cub Room 's <unk> was John " Jack " Spooner , who was well known to many celebrities from his previous duties at <unk> 's . Billingsley recruited him in 1934 after the death of Billy <unk> and the subsequent closure of his club . Spooner began an autograph book for his daughter , Amelia , while working at <unk> 's . Billingsley encouraged him to bring " The Book " to the Stork Club , where stars continued to sign it . Some who were famous illustrators or cartoonists such as E. C. Segar ( Popeye ) , Chic Young ( Blondie ) , and Theodor Geisel ( " Dr. Seuss " ) would add personalized doodles or drawings for Spooner 's young daughter . Billingsley 's rule of thumb for his help , " If you know them ... they don 't belong in here , " did not apply to Spooner . It was Spooner 's knowing the patrons and socializing with them away from the job that helped make the Stork Club so successful with attracting celebrity clients . At Christmas , Spooner dressed as Santa Claus , posing for photos with old and young alike .

 Author T. C. <unk> has referred to the Stork Club during its existence as " the most celebrated nightspot in the world " ; while author Ed McMahon has called it the " most realistic nightclub of all " , a name " synonymous with fame , class , and money , in no particular order " . Society writer Lucius Beebe wrote in 1946 : " To millions and millions of people all of over the world the Stork symbolizes and epitomizes the de luxe upholstery of quintessentially urban existence . It means fame ; it means wealth ; it means an elegant way of life among celebrated folk " . The club was a prime example of the flourishing cafe society at the time , but the real purpose of the Stork Club , according to journalist Ed Sullivan , was people watching other people , particularly non @-@ celebrities watching celebrities . Author <unk> L. Allen , however , highlights that the club was more than a celebrity playground , and that " many decisions of tremendous social and economic importance regarding world affairs were made in the Stork Club during this time " , and the likes of Desi Arnaz and Lucille Ball could often be seen conversing with executive types . Mark Bernardo , author of Mad Men 's Manhattan : The Insider 's Guide , has said : " In some ways , the Stork Club was ahead of its time — courting celebrities by picking up their tabs , hiring a house photographer who sent candid shots of guests to the tabloids , and offering a private enclave called the Cub Room , where stars could huddle away from the prying eyes of fans , all hallmarks of modern clubs that cater to boldface names " . The venue was usually packed with luminaries during its golden years , and dining orders could take a long time to be dealt with . 
 Notable guests through the years included : Lucille Ball , Tallulah Bankhead , Joan Blondell , Charlie Chaplin , Frank Costello , Bing Crosby , the Duke and Duchess of Windsor , Brenda Frazier , Dorothy <unk> , Carmen Miranda , Dana Andrews , Michael O 'Shea , Judy Garland , the <unk> , Ernest Hemingway , Judy Holliday , J. Edgar Hoover , Grace Kelly , the Kennedys , Dorothy Kilgallen , Dorothy Lamour , Robert M. McBride , Vincent Price , Marilyn Monroe , the Nordstrom Sisters , Erik Rhodes , the Roosevelts , Ramón Rivero ( Diplo ) , J. D. Salinger , Frank Sinatra , Elizabeth Taylor , Gene Tierney , Mike Todd and Gloria Vanderbilt . 
 The main room of the club was also frequented by many of the prominent figures that had fled Europe , from royals to businessmen , debutantes , sportsmen and military dignitaries , who often , upon departing , took with them the signature ashtrays of the club as souvenirs . The news of Grace Kelly 's engagement to Prince Rainier of Monaco broke at the Stork . The couple was at the club on Tuesday , January 3 , 1956 , as the rumors flew . Veteran columnist Jack O 'Brian passed Kelly a note , saying that reliable sources indicated she was about to become engaged to the Prince . Kelly replied she could not answer the question posed by O 'Brian until Friday . Socialite Evalyn Walsh McLean , owner of the Hope Diamond , wore the gem as if it was costume jewelry . It disappeared at the Stork Club one night during Mrs. McLean 's visit there . Actress Beatrice Lillie found it under one of the club 's tables . Actor Warren Oates once worked at the club as a dishwasher . 
 = = = Conduct = = = 
 Guests were expected to dress to high standards , with men wearing evening suits and the women wearing " gowns with silk gloves reaching the elbow " . All women in full evening dress received an orchid or gardenia corsage , compliments of the Stork Club . A requirement for all men was a necktie ; those who were not wearing one were either lent one or had to buy one to gain admittance . Although African Americans were not explicitly barred from entry , there was a mutual understanding that they were not welcome . Billingsley insisted on orderly conduct for all of his Stork Club guests ; fighting , drunkenness or <unk> were prohibited . He ran the club on the principle of it being a place where people could have a good time and that it was somewhere he could bring his own family without worrying that they would see or hear something he did not want them to . Billingsley closely controlled the seating placement system in the club . <unk> women were not allowed to enter the club after 6 pm ; this was a protective measure for men who may have been out with someone other than their wives . 
 Several celebrities did not abide by the rules and were banned from the club . Humphrey Bogart was banned after a prolonged " shouting match " with Billingsley . Milton Berle was officially barred for too much table @-@ hopping , shouting and doing handsprings in the club ; Berle contended that the real reason was because of a Stork Club satire he had recently performed on his television program . Elliott Roosevelt , the so @-@ called " black sheep of the club " , became unwelcome at the club through an apparent misunderstanding . Billingsley had planned an engagement party for Roosevelt and his girl friend , vocalist Gigi Durston on the basis of the couple 's friends ' statements that they were going to be married . Durston had once worked at the Stork Club as a singer and Roosevelt was a long @-@ time customer of the club . Billingsley sent out publicity notices about the party ; the couple told him that they had no plans to announce their engagement at that time . Elliott Roosevelt was banned from the Stork and the party was canceled . Jackie Gleason , who was a frequent guest of the club with his two daughters , was being seated with a female companion when the couple was asked to leave the premises in March 1957 . Billingsley claimed that Gleason 's conversation became loud and off @-@ color when he arrived at a table and barred Gleason from the Stork Club for life . Gleason said that he had done nothing wrong . He wondered if the problem was because he was a member of the Musicians ' Union , since the club 's wait and kitchen staff had been on strike since January of that year . 
 Despite the rules and banishments , there were incidents which made their way into newspapers . Billingsley associate Steve <unk> believed that one " good fight " a year was permissible for a respectable night club . Johnny Weissmuller accused a Navy lieutenant of using a lit cigarette to burn the clothing of dancers as they passed his table . The lieutenant advised Weissmuller to get a haircut ; his wife told Weissmuller to go back to Hollywood with the other ape @-@ men . The Navy man suffered two black eyes and complained that Weissmuller 's friends held him as he was punched by Weissmuller . Ernest Hemingway once took issue with a stranger who slapped him on the back ; knocking him into three chairs and a table as he brushed him away . Billingsley contended that many of the incidents that appeared in print were minor disagreements which were inflated by the press . 
 Jack Benny invited long @-@ time friend , writer and performer Goodman Ace to lunch with him at the Stork . Ace arrived at the club first and received the " cold shoulder " because he was not recognized by the staff . When Benny arrived and asked for Ace , he was told that Ace became tired of waiting and left . Soon Ace began to receive mail from the Stork , which he proceeded to answer in his tongue in cheek style . Ace 's response to the message about the club having wonderful air conditioning was that after having received the cold shoulder there , he was well aware of the climate . <unk> responded to Ace with a gift of some Stork Club bow ties . Ace then asked for some matching socks so he might be in style to be turned away again . Ace and his wife became regulars at the club after the issue was resolved . 
 = = = Stork Club gifts = = = 
 Owner Billingsley was well known for his extravagant gifts presented to his favorite patrons , spending an average of $ 100 @,@ 000 a year on them . They included compacts studded with diamonds and rubies , French perfumes , champagne and other liquors , and even automobiles . Many of the gifts were specially made for the Stork club , with the club 's name and logo on them . Some of the best known examples were the gifts of <unk> perfume by Le Galion , which became known as the " fragrance of the Stork Club " . Billingsley convinced Arthur Godfrey , Morton Downey , and his own assistant , Steve Hannigan , to form an investment group with him to obtain the United States distributorship of the fragrance . The partners expanded into the sale of soap , cosmetics and other sundries under the Stork Club name . They called the business <unk> – the French word for stork ; the line was carried by various drug and department stores in the United States . Every female guest of the club received a small vial of perfume and a tube of Stork Club lipstick as souvenirs of her visit . It was also Billingsley 's standard practice to send every regular club patron a case of champagne at Christmas . 
 Sunday night was " Balloon Night " . As is common with New Year 's celebrations , balloons were held on the ceiling of the Main Dining Room by a net and the net would open at the stroke of midnight . As the balloons came down , the ladies would begin frantically trying to catch them . Each contained a number and a drawing would be held for the prizes , which ranged from charms for bracelets to automobiles ; there were also at least three $ 100 bills folded and placed randomly in the balloons . 
 Billingsley 's generosity was not confined to those who were always at the club . He received the following letter in 1955 : " I am grateful to you for your thoughtful kindness in sending me such a generous selection of attractive neckties . At the same time may I once again thank you for the cigars that you regularly send to the White House . " It was signed by Dwight D. Eisenhower . During World War II , three bomber planes were christened with the name of the Stork Club . Billingsley commissioned Tiffany & Co. to produce sterling silver Stork club logo Victory pins as gifts for their crew members . Patrons were not always on the receiving end ; Billingsley 's writings claimed that one of his waiters received a $ 20 @,@ 000 tip . A bartender received a new Cadillac from a grateful patron , and a headwaiter received a $ 10 @,@ 000 tip from tennis star Fred Perry . It was necessary for Billingsley to give the expensive gifts and to provide some to all of a celebrity 's Stork Club services for free to bring the stars to the club and keep them coming back . The notables were what brought people from all over the country in all walks of life to visit the Stork Club .

The sneak peek features Usher dancing in a glass box as different personal scenes including shots of his sons and footage from various concerts are projected towards the background . The full music video premiered on his Vevo channel October 11 , 2012 . 
 The video begins with a footage of Usher walking offstage during a show part of his OMG Tour ( 2010 — 11 ) , held at the O2 Arena , Berlin in January 2011 . Subsequently announcer explains , " He tried because he loves Berlin and he really wanted to give you guys a show , but he just couldn ’ t do it . Thanks for understanding . " Usher then speaks with a remorse , " I felt like a failure , hopeless , paralyzed , numb . " As the song starts Usher is seen chanting the lyrics while several sequence shots of him with his son and a sick woman in hospital are shown . The scenes are <unk> by Usher performing in a room full with bright white lights . Several other short scenes of Usher taking care of the sick woman , his son having a meal and Usher throwing money at strippers are shown . Several natural environments are projected onto a wall the singer stands in front off . As the song progresses , he enters in a glass box and starts dancing during the chorus . Scenes of Usher having toast with his friends , smoking a cigar and watching strippers performing lap @-@ dance for him are shown . The singer is shown holding man 's hand while he dies in a hospital . Then , he is seen unable to perform and cries in front of the microphone . The video ends with Usher managing to break the glass box . 
 Zara Golden of VH1 regarding the video commented that , although Usher had a lot of troubles in his life " he gives the kid a hug , enjoys a dance at the strip club ( why not ? ) and sings out all the rest in a recording booth . " Billboard 's David Greenwald praised the choreography and noted that Usher shows no signs of sickness as he performs the compound choreography , " which ends with a forceful escape " . Sam Lansky of Idolator was divided on the video and wrote that the singer " could have dug a little deeper to tap into some of that very real personal pain to bring something more emotionally charged to this video ; as it stands , it ’ s a little too polished to feel anything but contrived .

 = Null ( SQL ) = 
 Null is a special marker used in Structured Query Language ( SQL ) to indicate that a data value does not exist in the database . Introduced by the creator of the relational database model , E. F. Codd , SQL Null serves to fulfill the requirement that all true relational database management systems ( RDBMS ) support a representation of " missing information and inapplicable information " . Codd also introduced the use of the lowercase Greek omega ( ω ) symbol to represent Null in database theory . NULL is also an SQL reserved keyword used to identify the Null special marker . 
 This should not be confused with a value of 0 . A null value indicates a lack of a value - a lack of a value is not the same thing as a value of zero in the same way that a lack of an answer is not the same thing as an answer of " no " . For example , consider the question " How many books does Juan own ? " The answer may be " zero " ( we know that he owns none ) or " null " ( we do not know how many he owns , or doesn 't own ) . In a database table , the column reporting this answer would start out with no value ( marked by Null ) , and it would not be updated with the value " zero " until we have ascertained that Juan owns no books . 
 SQL null is a state ( unknown ) and not a value . This usage is quite different from most programming languages , where null means not assigned to a particular instance . 
 = = History = = 
 E. F. Codd mentioned nulls as a method of representing missing data in the relational model in a 1975 paper in the <unk> Bulletin of ACM @-@ <unk> . Codd 's paper that is most commonly cited in relation with the semantics of Null ( as adopted in SQL ) is his 1979 paper in the ACM Transactions on Database Systems , in which he also introduced his Relational Model / Tasmania , although much of the other proposals from the latter paper have remained obscure . Section 2 @.@ 3 of his 1979 paper details the semantics of Null propagation in arithmetic operations as well as comparisons employing a ternary ( three @-@ valued ) logic when comparing to nulls ; it also details the treatment of Nulls on other set operations ( the latter issue still controversial today ) . In database theory circles , the original proposal of Codd ( 1975 , 1979 ) is now referred to as " <unk> tables " . Codd later reinforced his requirement that all <unk> support Null to indicate missing data in a 1985 two @-@ part article published in <unk> magazine . 
 The 1986 SQL standard basically adopted Codd 's proposal after an implementation prototype in IBM System R. Although Don Chamberlin recognized nulls ( alongside duplicate rows ) as one of the most controversial features of SQL , he defended the design of Nulls in SQL invoking the pragmatic arguments that it was the least expensive form of system support for missing information , saving the programmer from many duplicative application @-@ level checks ( see <unk> problem ) while at the same time providing the database designer with the option not to use Nulls if he so desires ; for example , in order to avoid well known anomalies ( discussed in the semantics section of this article ) . Chamberlin also argued that besides providing some missing @-@ value functionality , practical experience with Nulls also led to other language features which rely on Nulls , like certain grouping constructs and outer joins . Finally , he argued that in practice Nulls also end up being used as a quick way to patch an existing schema when it needs to evolve beyond its original intent , coding not for missing but rather for inapplicable information ; for example , a database that quickly needs to support electric cars while having a miles @-@ per @-@ gallon column . 
 Codd indicated in his 1990 book The Relational Model for Database Management , Version 2 that the single Null mandated by the SQL standard was inadequate , and should be replaced by two separate Null @-@ type markers to indicate the reason why data is missing . In Codd 's book , these two Null @-@ type markers are referred to as ' A @-@ Values ' and ' I @-@ Values ' , representing ' Missing But Applicable ' and ' Missing But <unk> ' , respectively . Codd 's recommendation would have required SQL 's logic system be expanded to accommodate a four @-@ valued logic system . Because of this additional complexity , the idea of multiple Nulls with different definitions has not gained widespread acceptance in the database practitioners ' domain . It remains an active field of research though , with numerous papers still being published . 
 = = = Challenges = = = 
 Null has been the focus of controversy and a source of debate because of its associated three @-@ valued logic ( 3VL ) , special requirements for its use in SQL joins , and the special handling required by aggregate functions and SQL grouping operators . Computer science professor Ron van der <unk> summarized the various issues as : " The inconsistencies in the SQL standard mean that it is not possible to ascribe any intuitive logical semantics to the treatment of nulls in SQL . " Although various proposals have been made for resolving these issues , the complexity of the alternatives has prevented their widespread adoption . 
 = = Null propagation = = 
 = = = Arithmetic operations = = = 
 Because Null is not a data value , but a marker for an absent value , using mathematical operators on Null gives an unknown result , which is represented by Null . In the following example , multiplying 10 by Null results in Null : 
 This can lead to unanticipated results . For instance , when an attempt is made to divide Null by zero , platforms may return Null instead of throwing an expected " data exception - division by zero " . Though this behavior is not defined by the ISO SQL standard many DBMS vendors treat this operation similarly . For instance , the Oracle , PostgreSQL , MySQL Server , and Microsoft SQL Server platforms all return a Null result for the following : 
 = = = String concatenation = = = 
 String concatenation operations , which are common in SQL , also result in Null when one of the operands is Null . The following example demonstrates the Null result returned by using Null with the SQL | | string concatenation operator . 
 This is not true for all database implementations . In an Oracle RDBMS for example NULL and the empty string are considered the same thing and therefore ' Fish ' | | NULL | | ' Chips ' results in ' Fish Chips ' . 
 = = Comparisons with NULL and the three @-@ valued logic ( 3VL ) = = 
 Since Null is not a member of any data domain , it is not considered a " value " , but rather a marker ( or placeholder ) indicating the absence of value . Because of this , comparisons with Null can never result in either True or False , but always in a third logical result , Unknown . The logical result of the expression below , which compares the value 10 to Null , is Unknown : 
 However , certain operations on Null can return values if the absent value is not relevant to the outcome of the operation . Consider the following example : 
 In this case , the fact that the value on the left of OR is unknowable is irrelevant , because the outcome of the OR operation would be True regardless of the value on the left . 
 SQL implements three logical results , so SQL implementations must provide for a specialized three @-@ valued logic ( 3VL ) . The rules governing SQL three @-@ valued logic are shown in the tables below ( p and q represent logical states ) " The truth tables SQL uses for AND , OR , and NOT correspond to a common fragment of the <unk> and <unk> three @-@ valued logic ( which differ in their definition of implication , however SQL defines no such operation ) . 
 = = = Effect of Unknown in WHERE clauses = = = 
 SQL three @-@ valued logic is encountered in Data Manipulation Language ( DML ) in comparison predicates of DML statements and queries . The WHERE clause causes the DML statement to act on only those rows for which the predicate evaluates to True . Rows for which the predicate evaluates to either False or Unknown are not acted on by <unk> , <unk> , or <unk> DML statements , and are discarded by SELECT queries . Interpreting Unknown and False as the same logical result is a common error encountered while dealing with Nulls . The following simple example demonstrates this fallacy : 
 The example query above logically always returns zero rows because the comparison of the i column with Null always returns Unknown , even for those rows where i is Null . The Unknown result causes the SELECT statement to summarily discard each and every row . ( However , in practice , some SQL tools will retrieve rows using a comparison with Null . ) 
 = = = Null @-@ specific and 3VL @-@ specific comparison predicates = = = 
 Basic SQL comparison operators always return Unknown when comparing anything with Null , so the SQL standard provides for two special Null @-@ specific comparison predicates . The IS NULL and IS NOT NULL predicates ( which use a postfix syntax ) test whether data is , or is not , Null . 
 The SQL standard contains an extension F571 " Truth value tests " that introduces three additional logical unary operators ( six in fact , if we count their negation , which is part of their syntax ) , also using postfix notation . They have the following truth tables : 
 The F571 extension is orthogonal to the presence of the boolean datatype in SQL ( discussed later in this article ) and , despite syntactic similarities , F571 does not introduce boolean or three @-@ valued literals in the language . The F571 extension was actually present in <unk> , well before the boolean datatype was introduced to the standard in 1999 . The F571 extension is implemented by few systems however ; PostgreSQL is one of those implementing it . 
 The addition of IS UNKNOWN to the other operators of SQL 's three @-@ valued logic makes the SQL three @-@ valued logic functionally complete , meaning its logical operators can express ( in combination ) any conceivable three @-@ valued logical function . 
 On systems which don 't support the F571 extension , it is possible to emulate IS UNKNOWN p by going over every argument that could make the expression p Unknown and test those arguments with IS NULL or other NULL @-@ specific functions , although this may be more cumbersome . 
 = = = Law of the excluded fourth ( in WHERE clauses ) = = = 
 In SQL 's three @-@ valued logic the law of the excluded middle , p OR NOT p , no longer evaluates to true for all p . More precisely , in SQL 's three @-@ valued logic p OR NOT p is unknown precisely when p is unknown and true otherwise . Because direct comparisons with Null result in the unknown logical value , the following query 
 is not equivalent in SQL with 
 if the column x contains any Nulls ; in that case the second query would return some rows the first one does not return , namely all those in which x is Null . In classical two @-@ valued logic , the law of the excluded middle would allow the simplification of the WHERE clause predicate , in fact its elimination . Attempting to apply the law of the excluded middle to SQL 's 3VL is effectively a false dichotomy . The second query is actually equivalent with : 
 Thus , to correctly simplify the first statement in SQL requires that we return all rows in which x is not null . 
 In view of the above , observe that for SQL 's WHERE clause a tautology similar to the law of excluded middle can be written . Assuming the IS UNKNOWN operator is present , p OR ( NOT p ) OR ( p IS UNKNOWN ) is true for every predicate p . Among logicians , this is called law of excluded fourth . 
 There are some SQL expressions in which it is less obvious where the false dilemma occurs , for example : 
 produces no rows because IN is translates to an iterated version of equality over the argument set and 1 < > NULL is Unknown , just as a 1 = NULL is Unknown . ( The CAST in this example is needed only in some SQL implementations like PostgreSQL , which would reject it with a type checking error otherwise . In many systems plain SELECT NULL works in the <unk> . ) The missing case above is of course : 
 = = = Effect of Null and Unknown in other constructs = = = 
 = = = = Joins = = = = 
 Joins evaluate using the same comparison rules as for WHERE clauses . Therefore , care must be taken when using <unk> columns in SQL join criteria . In particular a table containing any nulls is not equal with a natural self @-@ join of itself , meaning that whereas <formula> is true for any relation R in relational algebra , a SQL self @-@ join will exclude all rows having a Null anywhere . An example of this behavior is given in the section analyzing the missing @-@ value semantics of Nulls . 
 The SQL COALESCE function or CASE expressions can be used to " simulate " Null equality in join criteria , and the IS NULL and IS NOT NULL predicates can be used in the join criteria as well . The following predicate tests for equality of the values A and B and treats Nulls as being equal . 
 = = = = CASE expressions = = = = 
 SQL provides two flavours of conditional expressions . One is called " simple CASE " and operates like a switch statement . The other is called a " searched CASE " in the standard , and operates like an if ... <unk> . 
 The simple CASE expressions use implicit equality comparisons which operate under the same rules as the DML WHERE clause rules for Null . Thus , a simple CASE expression cannot check for the existence of Null directly . A check for Null in a simple CASE expression always results in Unknown , as in the following : 
 Because the expression i = NULL evaluates to Unknown no matter what value column i contains ( even if it contains Null ) , the string ' Is Null ' will never be returned . 
 On the other hand , a " searched " CASE expression can use predicates like IS NULL and IS NOT NULL in its conditions . The following example shows how to use a searched CASE expression to properly check for Null : 
 In the searched CASE expression , the string ' Null Result ' is returned for all rows in which i is Null . 
 Oracle 's dialect of SQL provides a built @-@ in function <unk> which can be used instead of the simple CASE expressions and considers two nulls equal . 
 Finally , all these constructs return a NULL if no match is found ; they have a default ELSE NULL clause . 
 = = = = IF statements in procedural extensions = = = = 
 SQL / PSM ( SQL Persistent Stored Modules ) defines procedural extensions for SQL , such as the IF statement . However , the major SQL vendors have historically included their own proprietary procedural extensions . Procedural extensions for looping and comparisons operate under Null comparison rules similar to those for DML statements and queries . The following code fragment , in ISO SQL standard format , demonstrates the use of Null 3VL in an IF statement . 
 The IF statement performs actions only for those comparisons that evaluate to True . For statements that evaluate to False or Unknown , the IF statement passes control to the <unk> clause , and finally to the ELSE clause . The result of the code above will always be the message ' Result is Unknown ' since the comparisons with Null always evaluate to Unknown . 
 = = Analysis of SQL Null missing @-@ value semantics = = 
 The groundbreaking work of T. Imielinski and W. Lipski ( 1984 ) provided a framework in which to evaluate the intended semantics of various proposals to implement missing @-@ value semantics . This section roughly follows chapter 19 the " Alice " textbook . A similar presentation appears in the review of Ron van der <unk> , § 10 @.@ 4 . 
 = = = In selections and projections : weak representation = = = 
 <unk> representing missing information , such as Codd tables , are actually intended to represent a set of relations , one for each possible <unk> of their parameters ; in the case of Codd tables , this means replacement of Nulls with some concrete value . For example , 
 A construct ( such as a Codd table ) is said to be a strong representation system ( of missing information ) if any answer to a query made on the construct can be particularized to obtain an answer for any corresponding query on the relations it represents , which are seen as models of the construct . More precisely , if <formula> is a query formula in the relational algebra ( of " pure " relations ) and if <formula> is its lifting to a construct intended to represent missing information , a strong representation has the property that for any query q and ( table ) construct T , <formula> lifts all the answers to the construct , i.e. : 
 <formula> 
 ( The above has to hold for queries taking any number of tables as arguments , but the restriction to one table suffices for this discussion . ) Clearly Codd tables do not have this strong property if selections and projections are considered as part of the query language . For example , all the answers to 
 should include the possibility that a relation like <unk> may exist . However Codd tables cannot represent the disjunction " result with possibly 0 or 1 rows " . A device , mostly of theoretical interest , called conditional table ( or c @-@ table ) can however represent such an answer : 
 where the condition column is interpreted as the row doesn 't exist if the condition is false . It turns out that because the formulas in the condition column of a c @-@ table can be arbitrary propositional logic formulas , an algorithm for the problem whether a c @-@ table represents some concrete relation has a co @-@ NP @-@ complete complexity , thus is of little practical worth . 
 A weaker notion of representation is therefore desirable . Imielinski and Lipski introduced the notion of weak representation , which essentially allows ( lifted ) queries over a construct to return a representation only for sure information , i.e. if it 's valid for all " possible world " instantiations ( models ) of the construct . Concretely , a construct is a weak representation system if 
 <formula> 
 The right @-@ hand side of the above equation is the sure information , i.e. information which can be certainly extracted from the database regardless of what values are used to replace Nulls in the database . In the example we considered above , it 's easy to see that the intersection of all possible models ( i.e. the sure information ) of the query selecting WHERE Age = 22 is actually empty because , for instance , the ( <unk> ) query returns no rows for the relation <unk> . More generally , it was shown by Imielinski and Lipski that Codd tables are a weak representation system if the query language is restricted to projections , selections ( and renaming of columns ) . However , as soon as we add either joins or unions to the query language , even this weak property is lost , as evidenced in the next section . 
 = = = If joins or unions are considered : not even weak representation = = = 
 Let us consider the following query over the same Codd table Emp from the previous section : 
 Whatever concrete value one would choose for the NULL age of Harriet , the above query will return the full column of names of any model of Emp , but when the ( lifted ) query is run on Emp itself , Harriet will always be missing , i.e. we have : 
 Thus when unions are added to the query language , Codd tables are not even a weak representation system of missing information , meaning that queries over them don 't even report all sure information . It 's important to note here that semantics of UNION on Nulls , which are discussed in a later section , did not even come into play in this query . The " forgetful " nature of the two sub @-@ queries was all that it took to guarantee that some sure information went unreported when the above query was run on the Codd table Emp . 
 For natural joins , the example needed to show that sure information may be unreported by some query is slightly more complicated . Consider the table 
 and the query 
 The intuition for what happens above is that the Codd tables representing the projections in the <unk> lose track of the fact that the Nulls in the columns <unk> and <unk> are actually copies of the originals in the table J. This observation suggests that a relatively simple improvement of Codd tables ( which works correctly for this example ) would be to use Skolem constants ( meaning Skolem functions which are also constant functions ) , say <unk> and <unk> instead of a single NULL symbol . Such an approach , called v @-@ tables or Naive tables , is computationally less expensive that the c @-@ tables discussed above . However it is still not a complete solution for incomplete information in the sense that v @-@ tables are only a weak representation for queries not using any negations in selection ( and not using any set difference either ) . The first example considered in this section is using a negative selection clause , WHERE Age < > 22 , so it is also an example where v @-@ tables queries would not report sure information .
