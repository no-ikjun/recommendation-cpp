 The first volcanoes along the Juan de Fuca ridge , including Axial Seamount , were detected in the 1970s by satellite altimetry . Axial Seamount 's proximity to the western coast and shallow depth make it one of the most easily accessible seamounts in the world , and its unique geological setting and active state also makes it one of the most interesting , rivaling Davidson Seamount to the south in scientific interest . 
 The first bathymetry of the seamount was compiled by the NOAAS Surveyor in 1981 , as part of <unk> trials in the North Pacific . The survey was specifically meant to find and link seafloor hydrothermal activity to geomorphic features . Four areas of increased temperature concentration , indicative of hydrothermal activity were found , and the then @-@ unnamed Axial Seamount was among them . Submersible dives with Pisces IV and DSV Alvin in 1983 and 1984 discovered the first active black smoker vents in the north Pacific . Soon after Axial Seamount was named for its central position on the intersection of the Cobb @-@ Eickelberg Seamount chain and Juan de Fuca Ridge . That same year , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) founded its <unk> program , providing impetus for studying the volcano more closely . 
 Between 1987 and 1992 , a variety of pressure sensors , tilt sensors , temperature probes , and seismometers were dropped on the volcano in what came to be known as the Volcanic Systems <unk> ( <unk> ) . Further <unk> by the NOAAS Discoverer in 1991 and RV Sonne in 1996 detailed the seamount further , making it one of the best known features in the North Pacific . Also in 1996 , the New Millennium Observatory ( <unk> ) was established on Axial Seamount , to study volcanic perturbations and the effect they have on hydrothermal communities . 
 = = = 1998 eruption = = = 
 The 1998 eruption of Axial Seamount was preceded by several large earthquake swarms , common indicators of volcanic activity . The swarms correlated to magma movements in the volcano ; bottom pressure recorders deployed on the volcano between 1987 and 1992 recorded five instances of deflation in the summit surface ( caused by lava movement ) , ranging from 3 to 10 cm ( 1 to 4 in ) . In 1991 , the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) was granted access to the United States Navy 's SOSUS system , a chain of submerged hydrophones in the North Pacific originally used by the Navy to detect Russian submarines during the Cold War . Since 1993 , the NOAA has maintained a real @-@ time monitoring system that alerts the organization whenever an event occurs . The hydrophones are able to detect even very small earthquakes ( ~ magnitude 1 @.@ 8 ) by listening for the acoustic waves generated by T @-@ waves . These waves can propagate over large distances with minimal loss in power , making them an ideal way to record otherwise unnoticeable submarine earthquakes ; over the course of the eruption , only 3 earthquakes were strong enough to register on land @-@ based systems . However , they cannot interpret earthquake depth or what caused them . 
 Between 1991 and 1996 Axial Seamount experienced a single earthquake swarm of over 50 events . Between May and November 1997 this activity increased markedly , with SOSUS recording 5 such swarms , culminating with a massive 11 @-@ day , 8247 @-@ quake event around the time of the eruption , in January 1998 . The seismicity began at the summit , but within 6 hours had begun to migrate south as well ; by 29 November 1997 the swarm had moved south by 50 kilometers ( 31 mi ) . This coincided with lava release along the summit and southern flank . The seamount remained absolutely quiet thereafter , suggesting the completion of an eruptive cycle at the volcano . In all , <unk> earthquakes were detected , and 1669 were strong enough to be located . Earthquake activity was concentrated around the summit and southern rift zones , with the majority of events centered inside the summit caldera ; temperature probes and pressure recorders in the caldera recorded an average 0 @.@ 6 ° C ( 33 @.@ 1 ° F ) increase and 3 @.@ 3 m ( 11 ft ) height deflation , respectively , during the event . This close monitoring gives the 1998 eruption the distinction of being the only submarine eruption ever observed in situ . 
 The first post @-@ eruption expedition was organized and conducted by R / V <unk> on 12 February 1998 , which conducted conductivity , temperature , depth , and optical casts to unusual results . In May , a dedicated bathymetric survey of the seamount showed topographical changes along the volcano 's southern flank , which estimated the thickest flows to 13 m ( 43 ft ) . In July DSV Alvin made several dives on the seamount 's summit caldera , followed in August through September by an extensive observation and collection program using ROV <unk> , confirming the bathymetric estimates . A sheet flow more than 3 km ( 2 mi ) long and 500 to 800 m ( 1 @,@ 640 to 2 @,@ 625 ft ) wide was produced from Axial Seamount 's upper southern flank , on the site of what was formerly an active geothermal field . The southern flows were in an area marked by a difference between older sediments and newer , <unk> rock , and the maximum ridge generated by the eruption , at the crest of the southern flow , was 13 m ( 40 ft ) high . The total eruptive volume was roughly 0 @.@ 018 – 0 @.@ 076 km3 ( 0 @.@ 004 – 0 @.@ 018 cu mi ) . 
 The development , eruption , and close monitoring of Axial Seamount provided a fertile model on submarine volcanic eruptions to scientists ; several scientific papers on the topic were published soon after . 
 = = = 2011 eruption = = = 
 Seismic activity at Axial Seamount virtually disappeared after the 1998 eruption , and monitoring of the volcano was done principally with bottom pressure recorders deployed on the volcano 's flanks , supplemented since 2000 by annual measurements using pressure sensors mounted on Remotely Operated Vehicles ( ROVs ) and applied to local benchmarks . The sensors have shown that Axial Seamount is slowly <unk> ; just after the eruption the seamount was swelling at 20 cm ( 8 in ) per month , a number that decreased to 15 cm ( 6 in ) by 2006 . In eight years Axial Seamount recovered approximately 50 % of its 3 @.@ 2 m ( 10 @.@ 5 ft ) of pre @-@ eruption swelling , and in 2006 , William Chadwick of the Oregon State University and his associates calculated an eruption recurrence interval of ~ 16 years , predicting the next eruption would occur in approximately 2014 : 
 Axial Seamount behaves in a more predictable way than many other volcanoes ; likely due to its robust magma supply coupled with its thin crust , and its location on a mid @-@ ocean ridge spreading center . It is now the only volcano on the seafloor whose surface deformation has been continuously monitored throughout an entire eruption cycle . 
 This prediction was fulfilled when , in July 2011 , a dive using ROV Jason discovered new lava flows on the volcanoes that had not been present a year ago . The expeditionary crew recovered two bottom @-@ pressure recorders and two hydrophones ( a third was found buried in lava ) off the volcano , which together showed that the eruption had occurred during April , starting on 6 April 2011 . Although the instruments recorded hundreds of seismic events , only a handful had been noticed by SOSUS and land @-@ based seismometers , as many components of the system had been offline at the time . The volcano subsided by more than 2 m ( 7 ft ) and produced a 2 km ( 1 mi ) wide lava flow during the event , which was as much as three times larger than the 1998 eruption . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 In 1983 , a Canadian @-@ American collaborative expedition , named the Canadian American Seamount Expedition ( CASM ) , visited the northwestern edge of Axial Seamount 's summit caldera to investigate a persistent temperature anomaly in the region . In a series of eight dives conducted by Pisces IV , the scientists discovered a vibrant hydrothermal vent community on the leading edge of a 300 m ( 984 ft ) fissure within the caldera . Vent temperatures were measured around 35 ° C ( 95 ° F ) , approximately 30 ° C ( 86 ° F ) hotter than the surrounding environment . Camera tows and submersible dives through the 1980s and 1990s revealed Axial Seamount 's active state , including the only known black smoker in the northwest Pacific . Three venting centers have been recognized : the original site , named <unk> ; a southwestern caldera field discovered in the late 1980s , named <unk> ; and a site located on its southeastern rift zone , named <unk> . All are primarily sulfur / sulfide emitting . 
 The temperature and composition of Axial Seamount 's hydrothermal vents changes over time , but always maintains a roughly common identity , as do the vents ' individual microbial communities . Vents generally have a lower pH than the surrounding fluid , and are acidic and alkaline as a result . The temperature of the magma feeding the system is uncertain , and may vary between 300 and 550 ° C ( 572 and 1 @,@ 022 ° F ) . Curiously , vent fluid are heavily enriched in helium , containing five times the amount of the element as similar vents in the Galapagos , and 580 times that of regular seawater . 
 Tube worms of the Pogonophora family thicket the largest vents on Axial Seamounts , forming colonies up to 6 m2 ( 65 sq ft ) thick in places ; smaller , less nutritious vents feed bacterial mats , smaller tube worms , and limpets . The three most common microbial groups are bacterial <unk> , archaeon <unk> of the <unk> family , and <unk> of the Euryarchaeota family . The most common flora at Axial Seamount 's hydrothermal vents is the worm <unk> <unk> , which is found at hydrothermal sites of all descriptions on the Juan de Fuca ridge , and is the base of Axial Seamount 's hydrothermal ecosystem . Other species on the seamount include the tube worm P. <unk> , the sea snail Lepetodrilus <unk> , the bristle worm Amphisamytha galapagensis , and the sea spider <unk> <unk> .

 " Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' " was written , composed and co @-@ produced by Michael Jackson , and produced by Quincy Jones . It was originally written for his sister La Toya Jackson about her troubled relationship with her sisters @-@ in @-@ law , but Michael ended up recording the song , and La Toya sometimes performs the song at her concerts . The song was originally recorded in 1978 for the inclusion on the Off the Wall album , but was later re @-@ recorded in fall 1982 , in Los Angeles , California . " Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' " was one of the four songs that Jackson received writing credits on for his sixth studio album Thriller in 1982 . The song was released by Epic Records as the fourth single from the album . Unlike Thriller 's previous singles , " Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' " did not have a film or a music video released to promote it . 
 Aside from Thriller , " Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' " has been featured on multiple compilation and greatest hits albums by Jackson since the song 's release . " Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' " appeared on the first disc of Jackson 's two @-@ disc compilation album HIStory : Past , Present and Future , Book I in 1995 as well as the 25th anniversary edition of Thriller , entitled Thriller 25 , and the greatest hits album King of Pop ; both albums were released in 2008 . The song is also featured on the box set collection released in 2004 , The Ultimate Collection , the greatest hits album The Essential Michael Jackson , the compilation album This Is It , and the special box set The Collection released days after Jackson 's death . Some versions of the 1995 Earth Song CD single included the Brothers in Rhythm Mix and Tommy D 's Main Mix as B @-@ sides . The song was also remixed to the Immortal album in 2011 .

 = = Composition = = 
 A post @-@ disco and funk song , " Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' " was viewed as a nod to the disco sound of Jackson 's material on his previous studio album , Off the Wall , released in 1979 . Arranged by Jackson himself and played by percussionist Paulinho da Costa , the song 's rhythm was regarded as a " complex interweaving of drum @-@ machine patterns and work " , while the horn section , arranged by Jerry Hey , was described as both " brassy and precise " . Slant Magazine commented that the song was a " complicated tapestry of colliding hooks and pop references . " The song 's lyrics , " Too high to get over , too low to get under " , has strong similarities to Funkadelic 's opening salvo for " One Nation Under a Groove " . 
 The lyrics pertain to the media and press , as well as gossip and people trying to start arguments or problems for no reason , which he states in the lyrics , " Someone 's always tryin ' to start my baby crying , " and then goes to a more " quasi paranoia " yield in the " near @-@ bitterness " chorus , ' You 're a vegetable , you 're a vegetable / You 're just a buffet , you 're a vegetable / They 'll eat off you , you 're a vegetable . ' " In " Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' " , Jackson 's vocal range spans from G # 3 to E5 . Played in the key of E Major , the song is moderately bright and its metronome is 122 beats per minute . It has a basic sequence of D / E – E – D / E – E as its chord progression . The coda at the end of the song , which comes directly from Cameroonian saxophonist Manu Dibango 's 1972 disco song " Soul Makossa " , is " Mama @-@ say mama @-@ sah ma @-@ ma @-@ coo @-@ sah " . Makossa is a Cameroonian music genre and dance . Dibango sued Jackson and settled out of court for one million French francs , agreeing thereby to waive future rights to this recording but not future use of the material .

 " Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' " has received generally positive reviews from contemporary music critics . Christopher Connelly , a writer for Rolling Stone , described " Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' " as being Thriller 's " most combative track " . Connelly noted that in the " hyperactive " song , Jackson 's " emotions are so raw that the song nearly goes out of control " . He further commented that the song has a " tune that 's almost as exciting as seeing Jackson motivate himself across a concert stage – and a lot more unpredictable " . Remarking that while the song 's lyrics " won 't keep Elvis Costello awake nights " , they " do show that Jackson has progressed past the hey @-@ let 's @-@ hustle sentiments that dominated Off the Wall " . He added that Jackson 's " raw ability and conviction make material like " , citing " Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' " , as well as other of Thriller 's songs , " into first @-@ class cuts " . 
 Stephen Thomas Erlewine , a writer for AllMusic , listed " Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' " , along with " Beat It " , " Billie Jean " , and " Human Nature " , as being the best songs from Thriller . He also described the song as the " freshest funk on the album " . Eric <unk> , a writer for Slant Magazine , commented that with " three quick rimshots " , he felt that " Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' " was like a " court fanfare " . Robert Christgau , a music critic , commented that he 'd " expect to bear more " of Thriller 's " Wanna Be Startin ' Something " and " Thriller " on the " dancefloor " rather than in his " living room " . " Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' " received one Grammy Award nomination ; it was nominated for " Best R & B Song " at the 1984 Grammy Awards , but lost to " Billie Jean , " another of Jackson 's singles from Thriller .

 = = Live performances = = 
 " Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' " was one of the songs released as a single without an accompanying video . It nonetheless has attained a popularity rivaling its sister compositions on the album , and became Jackson ’ s song of choice for opening live concerts , although not being as strictly associated with a specific dance routine as those others has arguably allowed for more flexibility in performances and staging . 
 Three notable occurrences during live performances are the physically complicated " stop / start " dance technique that brings Jackson and his dancers to a frozen stop several times , the sing @-@ along between performer and audience during the bridge , and him singing " Hard To Get Over , Hard To Get Under " instead of " Too High To Get Over , Too Low To Get Under " in the studio version . 
 " Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' " , along with " Thriller " , " Beat It " and " Billie Jean " , was also used on every set list of Jackson ’ s tours , from the Victory Tour in 1984 , right the way through to the HIStory Tour in 1997 . Unlike most of the other songs performed live , " Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' " has never been lip @-@ synched during any of Jackson ’ s tours . 
 The song was first performed by Jackson as both a member of The Jacksons as well as a solo artist during world concert tours . It was performed by Jackson during the Jacksons final world concert series , including the Victory Tour in 1984 , for which it was the tour 's opening song . Similar to the Victory Tour , " Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' " was the Bad World Tour opening song on both tour legs . The concert series lasted from 1987 to 1989 . A version was released on the 2012 DVD Live at Wembley July 16 , 1988 . 
 " Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' " was also performed during Jackson 's Dangerous World Tour from June 1992 to November 1993 . The Dangerous World Tour was supposed to last longer , but was cancelled due to Jackson 's health concerns , as well as the stress from the false child sexual abuse accusations made against him . A version was released on the 2004 DVD Live in Bucharest : The Dangerous Tour . 
 The next , and what would be the last performance of the song , was during Jackson 's world concert tour , HIStory World Tour , from 1996 to 1997 . 
 Since March 2009 , Jackson was preparing to perform " Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' " during his This Is It concert series from 2009 to 2010 . During rehearsals for the This Is It concerts , Jackson 's performance of " Wanna Be Startin ' Somethin ' " contained an a cappella snippet of " Speechless " , from Jackson 's studio album Invincible ( 2001 ) . Following Jackson 's death in June of the same year , video footage of Jackson rehearsing the song was featured as the opening song in the 2009 concert documentary , Michael Jackson 's This Is It .

 = 47 Ursae Majoris b = 
 47 Ursae Majoris b ( abbreviated 47 UMa b ) , also named Taphao Thong ( Thai : <unk> , rtgs : Taphaothong , pronounced [ <unk> ̄ <unk> ] ) , is an extrasolar planet approximately 46 light @-@ years from Earth in the constellation of Ursa Major . The planet was discovered located in a long @-@ period orbit around the star 47 Ursae Majoris in January 1996 and as of 2011 it is the innermost of three known planets in its planetary system . It has a mass at least 2 @.@ 53 times that of Jupiter . 
 In July 2014 the International Astronomical Union launched a process for giving proper names to certain exoplanets and their host stars . The process involved public nomination and voting for the new names . In December 2015 , the IAU announced the winning name was Taphao Thong for this planet . The winning name was submitted by the Thai Astronomical Society of Thailand . Taphaothong was one of two sisters associated with a Thai folk tale . 
 = = Discovery = = 
 Like the majority of known extrasolar planets , Taphao Thong was discovered by detecting the changes in its star 's radial velocity as the planet 's gravity pulls the star around . This was achieved by observing the Doppler shift of the spectrum of Chalawan . After the discovery of the first extrasolar planet around a Sun @-@ like star , <unk> , astronomers Geoffrey Marcy and R. Paul Butler searched through their observational data for signs of extrasolar planets and soon discovered two : Taphao Thong and 70 Virginis b . The discovery of Taphao Thong was announced in 1996 . 
 = = Orbit and mass = = 
 47 Ursae Majoris b orbits at a distance of 2 @.@ 10 AU from its star , taking 1 @,@ 078 days or 2 @.@ 95 years to complete a revolution . It was the first long @-@ period planet around a main sequence star to be discovered . Unlike the majority of known long @-@ period extrasolar planets , the eccentricity of the orbit of 47 Ursae Majoris b is low . 
 A limitation of the radial velocity method used to detect 47 Ursae Majoris b is that only a lower limit on the planet 's mass can be obtained . Preliminary astrometric measurements made by the Hipparcos satellite suggest the planet 's orbit is inclined at an angle of 63 @.@ 1 ° to the plane of the sky , which would imply a true mass 12 % greater than the lower limit determined by radial velocity measurements . However , subsequent investigation of the data reduction techniques used suggests that the Hipparcos measurements are not precise enough to adequately characterise the orbits of substellar companions , and the true inclination of the orbit ( and hence the true mass ) are regarded as unknown . 
 = = Physical characteristics = = 
 Given the planet 's high mass , it is likely that 47 Ursae Majoris b is a gas giant with no solid surface . Because the planet has only been detected indirectly , properties such as its radius , composition , and temperature are unknown . Due to its mass it is likely to have a surface gravity 6 – 8 times that of Earth . Assuming a composition similar to that of Jupiter and an environment close to chemical equilibrium , the upper atmosphere of the planet is expected to contain water clouds , as opposed to the ammonia clouds typical of Jupiter . 
 Although 47 Ursae Majoris b is outside its star 's habitable zone , its gravitational influence would disrupt the orbit of planets in the outer part of the habitable zone . In addition , it may have disrupted the formation of terrestrial planets and reduced the delivery of water to any inner planets in the system . Therefore , planets located in the habitable zone of 47 Ursae Majoris are likely to be small and dry . 
 It has been theorized that light reflections and infrared emissions from 47 UMa b , along with tidal influence , could warm any moons in orbit around it to be habitable , despite the planet being outside the normally accepted habitable zone . 
 = Snake River = 
 The Snake River is a major river of the greater Pacific Northwest in the United States . At 1 @,@ 078 miles ( 1 @,@ 735 km ) long , it is the largest tributary of the Columbia River , the largest North American river that empties into the Pacific Ocean . Rising in western Wyoming , the river flows through the Snake River Plain of southern Idaho , then through the rugged Hells Canyon area via northeastern Oregon and the rolling Palouse Hills , to reach its mouth near the Washington Tri @-@ Cities area , where it enters the Columbia . Its drainage basin encompasses parts of six U.S. states , and its average discharge is over 54 @,@ 000 cubic feet per second ( 1 @,@ 500 m3 / s ) . 
 Rugged mountains divided by rolling plains characterize the <unk> diverse watershed of the Snake River . The Snake River Plain was created by a volcanic hotspot which now lies underneath Yellowstone National Park , where the headwaters of the Snake River arise . Gigantic glacial @-@ retreat flooding episodes that occurred during the previous Ice Age carved out many topographical features , including various canyons and ridges along the middle and lower Snake River . Two of these catastrophic flooding events significantly affected the river and its surrounds . 
 More than 11 @,@ 000 years ago , prehistoric Native Americans lived along the Snake . Salmon from the Pacific Ocean spawned in the millions in the river . These fish were central to the lives of the people along the Snake below Shoshone Falls . By the time Lewis and Clark crossed the Rockies and sighted the valley of a Snake tributary , the Nez Perce and Shoshone were the most powerful peoples in the region . Some tribes adopted use of horses after contact with Europeans , which reshaped their hunting and cultures for the next few hundred years before outside settlement . Later explorers and fur trappers further changed and used the resources of the Snake River basin . At one point , a hand sign made by the Shoshones representing fish was misinterpreted to represent a snake , giving the Snake River its name . 
 By the middle 19th century , the Oregon Trail , a pioneer trail of which a major portion followed the Snake River , had been established by aspiring settlers and traders . Steamboats and railroads moved agricultural products and minerals along the river throughout the 19th and early 20th centuries . The powerful , steep flow of the Snake River has been used since the 1890s to generate hydroelectricity , enhance navigation , and provide irrigation water from fifteen major dams built on the lower river , transforming it into a series of reservoirs . Several of these have been proposed for removal in order to restore some of the river 's once @-@ tremendous salmon runs .

 Formed by the confluence of three tiny headstreams on the southwest flank of Two Oceans Plateau in western Wyoming and Yellowstone National Park , the Snake starts out as a small river flowing west and south into Jackson Lake . Its first 50 miles ( 80 km ) run through the valley of Jackson Hole , which cuts between the Teton Range and the Continental Divide . The Snake takes a large bend northwest through Snake River Canyon , cutting through the Snake River Range and into eastern Idaho , receiving first the <unk> and Greys rivers before entering Palisades Reservoir . There it is also met by the Salt River at the mouth of Star Valley . After passing through Palisades Dam , the Snake River flows through the Snake River Plain , a vast physiographic province extending through southern Idaho across the massif of the Rocky Mountains and underlain by the Snake River Aquifer , one of the most productive aquifers in the United States . 
 Southwest of the city of Rexburg , the Snake receives from the right the Henrys Fork , sometimes called the North Fork of the Snake River . The confluence with the Henrys Fork takes the river southwards through downtown Idaho Falls , rounding the Fort Hall Indian Reservation and into American Falls Reservoir , receiving the Portneuf River . The Portneuf River Valley is an overflow channel that in the last glacial period carried floodwaters from pluvial Lake Bonneville into the Snake River Plain , carving out many topographic features and significantly altering the Snake River landscape . The Snake River resumes its journey westwards , then enters the Snake River Canyon of Idaho , where it drops over Shoshone Falls , a waterfall that marks the historical upriver limit of migrating salmon , and passing under the Perrine Bridge . Close to Twin Falls , the Snake approaches the southernmost point in its entire course , after which it starts to flow generally northwest . 
 Shortly after it passes within 30 miles ( 48 km ) of the Idaho state capital of Boise , the river surges past the state border into Oregon , close to where it meets the Owyhee , Boise and Payette rivers . The Snake River begins to define the roughly 200 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 320 km ) Idaho @-@ Oregon state border , which follows the river into Hells Canyon , a steep and spectacular gorge that cuts through the Salmon River Mountains and Blue Mountains of Idaho and Oregon . Hells Canyon is one of the most rugged and treacherous portions of the course of the Snake River , which pioneers on the Oregon Trail and steamboat operators in the 19th century had great difficulty negotiating . There were hundreds of rapids in Hells Canyon , some of which have been stilled by the three dams of the Hells Canyon Hydroelectric Project : Hells Canyon , Oxbow , and Brownlee . 
 The Salmon River , the largest tributary of the Snake River , meets it in one of the most remote areas of its entire course , nearly at the halfway point in Hells Canyon . From there , the Snake crosses into Washington and Idaho , receiving the Grande Ronde River from the west before receiving the Clearwater River at Lewiston , the uppermost major city on the navigable stretch of the Snake . As the Snake leaves Hells Canyon and spreads into the low @-@ lying Palouse Hills of eastern Washington , the Lower Snake River Project 's four dams have transformed the Snake River into a series of reservoirs . The confluence of the Snake and Columbia rivers has been submerged in Lake Wallula , the reservoir of McNary Dam . The Columbia River flows about 325 miles ( 523 km ) further west to the Pacific Ocean , cutting through the Cascade Range by way of the Columbia River Gorge . 
 = = Geology = = 
 As recently as 165 million years ago , most of western North America was still part of the Pacific Ocean . The nearly complete subduction of the Farallon Plate underneath the westward @-@ moving North American Plate created the Rocky Mountains , which were pushed up by rising magma trapped between the sinking Farallon plate and the North American plate . As the North American Plate moved westwards over a stationary hotspot beneath the crust , a series of tremendous lava flows and volcanic eruptions carved out the Snake River Plain beginning about 12 million years ago , west of the Continental Divide . Even larger lava flows of Columbia River basalts issued over eastern Washington , forming the Columbia Plateau southeast of the Columbia River and the Palouse Hills in the lower Snake . Separate volcanic activity formed the northwestern portion of the plain , an area far from the path of the hotspot which now lies beneath Yellowstone National Park . At this point , the Snake River watershed was beginning to take shape . 
 The Snake River Plain and the gap between the Sierra Nevada and Cascade Range formed a " moisture channel , " running as far inland as the headwaters of the Snake River . <unk> from the Pacific Ocean blown into the moisture channel travel eastwards over 1 @,@ 000 miles ( 1 @,@ 600 km ) . When the Teton Range uplifted about 9 million years ago along a detachment fault running north – south through the central Rockies , <unk> began to encounter a barrier at the eastern end of the channel , engorging the headwaters of the Snake River with frequent rainfall . These rains fed the Snake River , helping it to cut through the Tetons , forming the Snake River Canyon of Wyoming . About 6 million years ago , the Salmon River Mountains and Blue Mountains at the far end of the plain began to rise , and as the river cut through the rising mountains , the ancestral Hells Canyon was formed . Lake Idaho , formed during the Miocene , covered a large portion of the Snake River Plain between Twin Falls and Hells Canyon , and its lava dam was finally breached about 2 million years ago . 
 Lava flowing from Cedar Butte in present southeast Idaho blocked the Snake River at Eagle Rock , about 42 @,@ 000 years ago , near the present @-@ day site of American Falls Dam . A 40 @-@ mile ( 64 km ) -long lake , known as American Falls Lake , formed behind the barrier . The lake was stable and survived for nearly 30 @,@ 000 years . About 14 @,@ 500 years ago , pluvial Lake Bonneville in the Great Salt Lake area , formed in the last glacial period , spilled catastrophically down the Portneuf River into the Snake in an event known as the Bonneville Flood . This was one of the first in a series of catastrophic flooding events in the Northwest known as the Ice Age Floods . 
 The deluge caused American Falls Lake to breach its natural lava dam , which was rapidly eroded with only the 50 @-@ foot ( 15 m ) -high American Falls left in the end . The flood waters of Lake Bonneville , approximately twenty times the flow of the Columbia River or 5 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 cubic feet per second ( 150 @,@ 000 m3 / s ) , swept down the Snake River , leaving debris and sediment deposits across southern Idaho . For miles on either side of the Snake , flood waters stripped away soils and scoured the underlying basalt bedrock , in the process creating Shoshone Falls , Twin Falls , Crane Falls , and Swan Falls , while cutting and deepening gorges and canyons along the way . The Bonneville flood waters continued through Hells Canyon . The flood widened Hells Canyon but did not deepen it . 
 As the Bonneville Floods rushed down the Snake River , the Missoula Floods occurred in the same period , but farther north . The Missoula Floods , which took place more than 40 times in the time span from 15 @,@ 000 to 13 @,@ 000 years ago , were caused by Glacial Lake Missoula on the Clark Fork repeatedly being impounded by ice dams then breaking through , with the lake 's water rushing over much of eastern Washington in massive surges far larger than the Lake Bonneville Flood . These floods pooled behind the Cascade Range into enormous lakes and spilled over the northern drainage divide of the Snake River watershed , carving deep canyons through the Palouse Hills . The Palouse River canyon was the largest of the many gorges cut through the Palouse Hills , and could not have become as large as it now is if it were not for the Missoula Floods . The Lake Bonneville Floods and the Missoula Floods helped widen and deepen the Columbia River Gorge , a giant water gap which allows water from the Columbia and Snake rivers to take a direct route through the Cascade Range to the Pacific . 
 The massive amounts of sediment deposited by the Lake Bonneville Floods in the Snake River Plain also had a lasting effect on most of the middle Snake River . The high hydraulic conductivity of the mostly @-@ basalt rocks in the plain led to the formation of the Snake River Aquifer , one of the most productive aquifers in North America . Many rivers and streams flowing from the north side of the plain sink into the aquifer instead of flowing into the Snake River , a group of watersheds called the lost streams of Idaho . The aquifer filled to hold nearly 100 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 120 km3 ) of water , underlying about 10 @,@ 000 square miles ( 26 @,@ 000 km2 ) in a plume 1 @,@ 300 feet ( 400 m ) thick . In places , water exits from rivers at rates of nearly 600 cubic feet per second ( 17 m3 / s ) . Much of the water lost by the Snake River as it transects the plain issues back into the river at its western end , by way of many artesian springs .

 The Snake River is the thirteenth longest river in the United States . Its watershed is the 10th largest among North American rivers , and covers almost 108 @,@ 000 square miles ( 280 @,@ 000 km2 ) in portions of six U.S. states : Wyoming , Idaho , Nevada , Utah , Oregon , and Washington , with the largest portion in Idaho . Most of the Snake River watershed lies between the Rocky Mountains on the east and the Columbia Plateau on the northwest . The largest tributary of the Columbia River , the Snake River watershed makes up about 41 % of the entire Columbia River Basin . Its average discharge at the mouth constitutes 31 % of the Columbia 's flow at that point . Above the confluence , the Snake is slightly longer than the Columbia — 1 @,@ 078 miles ( 1 @,@ 735 km ) compared to 928 miles ( 1 @,@ 493 km ) — and its drainage basin is slightly larger — 4 % bigger than the upstream Columbia River watershed . 
 The mostly semi @-@ arid , even desert climate of the Snake River watershed on average , receives less than 12 inches ( 300 mm ) of precipitation per year . However , precipitation in the Snake River watershed varies widely . At Twin Falls , in the center of the Snake River Plain , the climate is nearly desert , with an annual rainfall of just 9 @.@ 24 inches ( 235 mm ) , although the average snowfall is 13 @.@ 1 inches ( 330 mm ) . This desert climate occupies the majority of the basin of the Snake River , so although it is longer than the Columbia River above the Tri @-@ Cities , its discharge is on average significantly less . However , in the high Rockies of Wyoming , in the upper Jackson Hole area , the average precipitation is over 30 inches ( 760 mm ) , and snowfall averages 252 inches ( 6 @,@ 400 mm ) . Most of the Snake River basin consists of wide , arid plains and rolling hills , bordered by high mountains . In the upper parts of the watershed , however , the river flows through an area with a distinct alpine climate . There are also stretches where the river and its tributaries have incised themselves into tight gorges . The Snake River watershed includes parts of Yellowstone National Park , Grand Teton National Park , Hells Canyon National Recreation Area , and many other national and state parks . 
 Much of the area along the river , within a few miles of its banks , is irrigated farmland , especially in its middle and lower course . Irrigation dams include American Falls Dam , Minidoka Dam , and C.J. Strike Dam . Aside from water from the river , water is also pulled from the Snake River Aquifer for irrigation . Major cities along the river include Jackson in Wyoming , Twin Falls , Idaho Falls , Boise , and Lewiston in Idaho , and the Tri @-@ Cities in Washington ( Kennewick , Pasco and Richland ) . There are fifteen dams in total along the Snake River , which aside from irrigation , also produce electricity , maintain a navigation channel along part of the river 's route , and provide flood control . However , fish passage is limited to the stretch below Hells Canyon . 
 The Snake River watershed is bounded by several other major North American watersheds , which drain both to the Atlantic or the Pacific , or into endorheic basins . On the southwest side a divide separates the Snake watershed from Oregon 's Harney Basin , which is endorheic . On the south , the Snake watershed borders that of the Humboldt River in Nevada , and the watershed of the Great Salt Lake ( the Bear , Jordan and Weber rivers ) on the south . The Snake River also shares a boundary with the Green River to the southeast ; the Green River drains parts of Wyoming and Utah and is the largest tributary of the Colorado River . On the western extremity for a short stretch the Continental Divide separates the Snake watershed from the Bighorn River , a tributary of the Yellowstone River , which the Snake begins near . On the north the Snake River watershed is bounded by the Red Rock River , a tributary of the Beaverhead River , which flows into the Jefferson River and into the Missouri River , part of the Gulf of Mexico drainage basin . 
 The rest of the Snake River watershed borders on several other major Columbia River tributaries - mostly the Spokane River to the north , but also Clark Fork in Montana to the northeast and the John Day River to the west . Of these , the Clark Fork ( via the Pend Oreille River ) and the Spokane join the Columbia above the Snake , while the John Day joins downstream of the Snake , in the Columbia River Gorge . It is of note that the northeastern divide of the Snake River watershed forms the Idaho @-@ Montana boundary , so the Snake River watershed does not extend into Montana . 
 Mountain ranges in the Snake watershed include the Teton Range , Bitterroot Range , Clearwater Mountains , Seven Devils Mountains , and the extreme northwestern end of the Wind River Range . Grand Teton is the highest point in the Snake River watershed , reaching 13 @,@ 775 feet ( 4 @,@ 199 m ) in elevation . The elevation of the Snake River is 358 feet ( 109 m ) when it joins the Columbia River . 
 = = = Pollution = = = 
 Agricultural runoff from farms and ranches in the Snake River Plain and many other areas has severely hurt the ecology of the river throughout the 20th century . After the first irrigation dams on the river begun operation in the first decade of the 20th century , much of the arable land in a strip a few miles wide along the Snake River was cultivated or turned to pasture , and agricultural return flows began to pollute the Snake . Runoff from several feedlots was dumped into the river until laws made the practice illegal . Fertilizer , manure and other chemicals and pollutants washed into the river greatly increase the nutrient load , especially of phosphorus , fecal coliforms and nitrogen . During low water , algae blooms occur throughout the calm stretches of the river , depleting its oxygen supply . 
 Much of the return flows do not issue directly back into the Snake River , but rather feed the Snake River Aquifer underneath the Snake River Plain . Water diverted from the river for irrigation , after absorbing any surface pollutants , re @-@ enters the ground and feeds the aquifer . Although the aquifer has maintained its level , it has become increasingly laced with contaminants . Water in the aquifer eventually travels to the west side of the Snake River Plain and re @-@ enters the river as springs . Throughout much of the Snake River Plain and Hells Canyon , excessive sediment is also a recurring problem . In December 2007 , the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) issued a permit requiring owners of fish farms along the Snake River to reduce their phosphorus discharge by 40 % . <unk> levels in Hells Canyon upstream of the Salmon River confluence , including that of water temperature , dissolved nutrients , and sediment , are required to meet certain levels .

 The Snake River 's average flow is 54 @,@ 830 cubic feet per second ( 1 @,@ 553 m3 / s ) . The United States Geological Survey recorded the river 's discharge from a period of 1963 – 2000 at a stream gauge below Ice Harbor Dam . In that period , the largest average annual flow recorded was 84 @,@ 190 cubic feet per second ( 2 @,@ 384 m3 / s ) in 1997 , and the lowest was 27 @,@ 100 cubic feet per second ( 770 m3 / s ) in 1992 . The lowest recorded daily mean flow was 2 @,@ 700 cubic feet per second ( 76 m3 / s ) on February 4 , 1979 . On August 27 , 1965 , there was temporarily no flow as a result of testing at Ice Harbor Dam . The highest recorded flow was 312 @,@ 000 cubic feet per second ( 8 @,@ 800 m3 / s ) on June 19 , 1974 . The highest flow ever recorded on the Snake River was at a different USGS stream gauge near Clarkston , which operated from 1915 to 1972 . This gauge recorded a maximum flow of 369 @,@ 000 cubic feet per second ( 10 @,@ 400 m3 / s ) — more than the Columbia 's average discharge — on May 29 , 1948 . An even larger peak discharge , estimated at 409 @,@ 000 cubic feet per second ( 11 @,@ 600 m3 / s ) , occurred during the flood of June 1894 . 
 The river 's flow is also measured at several other points in its course . Above Jackson Lake , Wyoming , the discharge is about 885 cubic feet per second ( 25 @.@ 1 m3 / s ) from a drainage area of 486 square miles ( 1 @,@ 260 km2 ) . At Minidoka , Idaho , about halfway through the Snake River Plain , the river 's discharge rises to 7 @,@ 841 cubic feet per second ( 222 @.@ 0 m3 / s ) . However , at Buhl , Idaho , only about 50 miles ( 80 km ) downstream , the river 's flow decreases to 4 @,@ 908 cubic feet per second ( 139 @.@ 0 m3 / s ) because of agricultural diversions and seepage . But at the border of Idaho and Oregon , near Weiser at the beginning of Hells Canyon , the Snake 's flow rises to 17 @,@ 780 cubic feet per second ( 503 m3 / s ) after receiving several major tributaries such as the Payette , Owyhee and Malheur . The discharge further increases to 19 @,@ 530 cubic feet per second ( 553 m3 / s ) at Hells Canyon Dam on the border of Idaho and Oregon . At <unk> , Washington , downstream of the confluence with the Salmon , one of the Snake 's largest tributaries , the mean discharge is 34 @,@ 560 cubic feet per second ( 979 m3 / s ) .

 Canadian explorer David Thompson first recorded the Native American name of the Snake River as <unk> when he arrived at its mouth by boat in 1800 . When the Lewis and Clark Expedition crossed westwards into the Snake River watershed in 1805 , they first gave it the name Lewis River , Lewis Fork or Lewis 's Fork , as Meriwether Lewis was the first of their group to sight the river . They also made note of the " Snake Indians " who lived along the river , who were actually the Shoshone tribe , and learned that the Native Americans called the river Ki @-@ moo @-@ e @-@ <unk> or Yam @-@ pah @-@ pa ( for an herb that grew prolifically along its banks ) . Later American explorers , some of whom were originally part of the Lewis and Clark expedition , journeyed into the Snake River watershed and records show a variety of names have been associated with the river . The explorer Wilson Price Hunt of the Astor Expedition named the river as Mad River . Others gave the river names including Shoshone River ( after the tribe ) and <unk> River . Eventually , the name Snake River was derived from an S @-@ shaped gesture the Shoshone tribe made with their hands to represent swimming salmon . Explorers misinterpreted it to represent a snake , giving the river its present @-@ day name .

 People have been living along the Snake River for at least 11 @,@ 000 years . Historian Daniel S. <unk> divides the prehistory of the western Snake River Basin into three main phases or " adaptive systems " . The first he calls " Broad Spectrum Foraging " , dating from 11 @,@ 500 to 4 @,@ 200 years before present . During this period people drew upon a wide variety of food resources . The second period , " <unk> Foraging " , dates from 4 @,@ 200 – 250 years before present and is distinctive for an increased reliance upon fish , especially salmon , as well as food preservation and storage . The third phase , from 250 to 100 years before present , he calls " Equestrian Foragers " . It is characterized by large horse @-@ mounted tribes that spent long amounts of time away from their local foraging range hunting bison . In the eastern Snake River Plain there is some evidence of Clovis , Folsom , and Plano cultures dating back over 10 @,@ 000 years ago . 
 Early fur traders and explorers noted regional trading centers , and archaeological evidence has shown some to be of considerable antiquity . One such trading center in the Weiser area existed as early as 4 @,@ 500 years ago . The Fremont culture may have contributed to the historic Shoshones , but it is not well understood . Another poorly understood early cultural component is called the Midvale Complex . The introduction of the horse to the Snake River Plain around 1700 helped in establishing the Shoshone and Northern Paiute cultures . 
 On the Snake River in southeastern Washington there are several ancient sites . One of the oldest and most well @-@ known is called the Marmes Rockshelter , which was used from over 11 @,@ 000 years ago to relatively recent times . The Marmes Rockshelter was flooded in 1968 by Lake Herbert G. West , the Lower Monumental Dam 's reservoir . 
 Eventually , two large Native American groups controlled most of the Snake River : the Nez Perce , whose territory stretched from the southeastern Columbia Plateau into northern Oregon and western Idaho , and the Shoshone , who occupied the Snake River Plain both above and below Shoshone Falls . Lifestyles along the Snake River varied widely . Below Shoshone Falls , the economy centered on salmon , who often came up the river in enormous numbers . Salmon were the mainstay of the Nez Perce and most of the other tribes below Shoshone Falls . Above the falls , life was significantly different . The Snake River Plain forms one of the only relatively easy paths across the main Rocky Mountains for many hundreds of miles , allowing Native Americans both east and west of the mountains to interact . As a result , the Shoshone centered on a trading economy . 
 According to legend , the Nez Perce tribe was first founded in the valley of the Clearwater River , one of the Snake River 's lowermost major tributaries . At its height , there were at least 27 Nez Perce settlements along the Clearwater River and 11 more on the Snake between the mouth of the Clearwater and Imnaha Rivers . There were also villages on the Salmon River , Grande Ronde River , Tucannon River , and the lower Hells Canyon area . The Snake River 's annual salmon run , which was estimated at that time to exceed four million in good years , supported the Nez Perce , who lived in permanent , well @-@ defined villages , unlike the nomadic southeastern tribes along the Snake River . The Nez Perce also were involved in trade with the Flathead tribe to the north and other middle Columbia River tribes . However , they were enemies to the Shoshone and the other upstream Snake River tribes . 
 The Shoshone or <unk> were characterized by nomadic groups that took their culture from the earlier Bitterroot culture and Great Basin tribes that migrated north via the Owyhee River . They were the most powerful tribe in the Rocky Mountains area , and were known to many Great Plains tribes as the " Snakes " . In the 18th century , Shoshone territory extended beyond the Snake River Plain , extending over the Continental Divide into the upper Missouri River watershed and even further north into Canada . A smallpox epidemic brought by European explorers and fur trappers was responsible for wiping out much of the Shoshone east of the Rocky Mountains , but the Shoshone continued to occupy the Snake River Plain . Eventually , the Shoshone culture merged with that of the Paiute and Bannock tribes , which came from the Great Basin and the Hells Canyon area , respectively . The Bannock brought with them the skill of buffalo hunting and horses they had acquired from Europeans , changing the Shoshone way of life significantly .

 The Lewis and Clark Expedition ( 1804 – 06 ) was the first American group to cross the Rocky Mountains and sail down the Snake and Columbia rivers to the Pacific Ocean . Meriwether Lewis supposedly became the first American to sight the drainage basin of the Snake River after he crossed the mountains a few days ahead of his party on August 12 , 1805 , and sighted the Salmon River valley ( a major Snake tributary ) from Lemhi Pass , a few miles from the present @-@ day site of Salmon , Idaho . The party later traveled north , descended the Lemhi River to the Salmon and attempted to descend it to the Snake , but found it impassable because of its violent rapids . The expedition named the Snake River the Lewis River , Lewis 's River , or Lewis Fork , in his honor , and they traveled northwards to the <unk> River , which they traveled via the Clearwater River into the lower Snake , and into the Columbia . They also referred to the Shoshone Indians as the " Snake Indians " , which became the present @-@ day name of the river . The name " Lewis Fork " , however , did not last . 
 Later American explorers traveled throughout the Snake River area and up its major tributaries beginning in 1806 , just after Lewis and Clark had returned . The first was John Ordway in 1806 , who also explored the lower Salmon River . John Colter in 1808 was the first to sight the upper headwaters of the Snake River , including the Jackson Hole area . In 1810 , Andrew Henry , along with a party of fur trappers , discovered the Henrys Fork of the Snake River , which is now named after him . Donald Mackenzie sailed the lower Snake River in 1811 , and later explorers included Wilson Price Hunt of the Astor Expedition ( who gave the river the name " Mad River " ) , Ramsay Crooks , Francisco <unk> , John Grey , <unk> Goddin , and many others after the 1830s . Many of these later explorers were original members of the Lewis and Clark Expedition who had returned to map and explore the area in greater detail . Even later , American fur trappers scouted the area for beaver streams , but Canadian trappers from the British Hudson 's Bay Company were by now a major competitor . 
 The Hudson 's Bay Company first sent fur trappers into the Snake River watershed in 1819 . The party of three traveled into the headwaters of the Owyhee River , a major southern tributary of the Snake , but disappeared . Meanwhile , as American fur trappers kept coming to the region , the Hudson 's Bay Company ordered the Canadian trappers to kill as many beavers as they could , eventually nearly eradicating the species from the Snake River watershed , under the " rationale [ that ] if there are no beavers , there will be no reason for the Yanks ( [ Americans ] ) to come . " Their goal was to eventually gain rights over the Oregon Territory , a region covering Washington , Oregon , Idaho , and parts of Montana and Wyoming ( most of the present @-@ day region called the Pacific Northwest ) . However , the area was eventually annexed into the United States . 
 By the middle 19th century , the Oregon Trail had been established , generally following much of the Snake River . One crossing the trail made over the Snake River was near the present @-@ day site of <unk> Ferry . Several years later , a ferry was established at the site , replacing the old system where pioneers had to ford the wide , powerful and deep Snake . Another place where pioneers crossed the Snake was further upstream , at a place called " Three Island Crossing " , near the mouth of the Boise River . This area has a group of three islands ( hence the name ) that splits the Snake into four channels each about 200 feet ( 61 m ) wide . Some emigrants chose to ford the Snake and proceed down the west side and recross the river near Fort Boise into Hells Canyon , continue down the drier east side into the gorge , or float the Snake and Columbia to the Willamette River , the destination of the Oregon Trail . The reason for the Three Island Crossing was the better availability of grass and water access . Numerous ferries have provided crossings of the upper Snake from the Brownlee Ferry at the head of Hell 's Canyon to Menor 's Ferry , which operates today at Moose , Wyoming . <unk> varied from reed boats pulled by Indians on horse back at Snake Fort , Fort Boise , as described by Narcissa Whitman in 1836 to an electric operated ferry , the Swan Falls Ferry , at Swan Falls Dam of the early 20th century . 
 = = = Steamboats = = = 
 Unlike the Columbia River , it was far more difficult for steamboats to navigate on the Snake . The Columbia River drops 2 @,@ 690 feet ( 820 m ) from source to mouth , while the Snake drops over 8 @,@ 500 feet ( 2 @,@ 600 m ) in elevation over a length more than 200 miles ( 320 km ) shorter . Still , from the 1860s to the 1940s , steamboats traveled on the Snake River from its mouth at the Columbia River to near the mouth of the Imnaha River in lower Hells Canyon . However , most of the steamboats only sailed from the river 's mouth to Lewiston , located at the confluence of the Snake and Clearwater rivers . This stretch of the river is the easiest to navigate for watercraft since it has the least elevation change , although it still contained over 60 sets of rapids . 
 Passenger and freight service downstream of Lewiston lasted throughout the late 19th century and persisted until the introduction of railroads in the Palouse Hills grain @-@ growing region and ultimately , the construction of dams on the lower Snake to facilitate barge traffic , which caused the demise of both the steamboats and the railroad . Lewiston , 140 miles ( 230 km ) from the confluence of the Snake and Columbia and 465 miles ( 748 km ) from the mouth of the Columbia on the Pacific Ocean , became connected with Portland and other Pacific ports via steamboat service from the mouth of the Snake through the Columbia River Gorge . A commonly traveled route was from Wallula , Washington , 120 miles ( 190 km ) downstream of the Snake River 's mouth , upstream to Lewiston . The Oregon Steam Navigation Company launched the Shoshone at Fort Boise in 1866 which provided passenger and freight service on the upper Snake for the Boise and Owyhee mines . 
 By the 1870s , the OSN Company , owned by the Northern Pacific Railroad , was operating seven steamboats for transporting wheat and grain from the productive Palouse region along the Snake and Columbia to lower Columbia River ports . These boats were the Harvest Queen , John Gates , Spokane , Annie <unk> , Mountain Queen , R.R. Thompson , and Wide West , all of which were built on the Columbia River . However , there were more resources along the Snake River than wheat and grain . In the 1890s , a huge copper deposit was discovered at Eureka Bar in Hells Canyon . Several ships were built specifically to transport ore from there to Lewiston : these included Imnaha , Mountain Gem , and Norma . In 1893 the Annie <unk> suffered a boiler explosion and sank on the Snake below Lewiston .

 = = = Dams = = = 
 Many factors have influenced the construction of dams along the Snake River . A total of fifteen dams have been constructed along the Snake River for a multitude of different purposes , from its headwaters in the Rocky Mountains to its mouth on Lake Wallula , a slackwater reservoir formed behind McNary Dam on the Columbia River . Dams on the Snake can be grouped into three major categories . From its headwaters to the beginning of Hells Canyon , many small dams block the Snake to provide irrigation water . Between here and Hells Canyon , the first dam on the Snake , Swan Falls Dam , was built in 1901 . In Hells Canyon , a cascade of dams produce hydroelectricity from the river 's lofty decrease in elevation over a comparatively small distance . Finally , a third cascade of dams , from Hells Canyon to the mouth , facilitates navigation . Many different government and private agencies have worked to build dams on the Snake River , which now serve an important purpose for people living in the Snake 's drainage basin and trade of agricultural products to Pacific seaports . 
 The Minidoka Irrigation Project of the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation , created with the passage of the Reclamation Act of 1902 , involved the diversion of Snake River water into the Snake River Plain upstream of Shoshone Falls in order to irrigate approximately 1 @,@ 100 @,@ 000 acres ( 4 @,@ 500 km2 ) in the Snake River Plain and store 4 @,@ 100 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 5 @.@ 1 km3 ) of water in Snake River reservoirs . The first studies for irrigation in the Plain were conducted by the United States Geological Survey in the late 19th century , and the project was authorized on April 23 , 1904 . The first dam constructed for the project was Minidoka Dam in 1904 ; its power plant began operating in 1909 , producing 7 MW of electricity . This capacity was revised to 20 MW in 1993 . However , Minidoka Dam was not the only dam constructed for the project . As far upstream as Jackson Lake in Wyoming , the Jackson Lake Dam was built in 1907 to raise the lake level for providing additional water storage for dry years . American Falls Dam , upstream of Minidoka , was completed in 1927 and replaced in 1978 . As the dams were constructed above Shoshone Falls , the historical upriver limit of salmon and also a total barrier to boats and ships , no provisions were made for fish passage or navigation . Several other irrigation dams were also built - including Twin Falls Dam and Palisades Dam . 
 The Hells Canyon Project was built and maintained by Idaho Power Company starting in the 1940s , and was the second of the three major water projects on the river . The three dams of the project , Brownlee Dam , Oxbow Dam and Hells Canyon Dam , are located in upper Hells Canyon . All three dams are primarily for power generation and flood control , and do not have fish passage or navigation locks . Brownlee Dam , the most upriver dam , was constructed in 1959 , and generates 728 MW of power . Oxbow Dam , the second dam in the project , was built in 1961 and generates 220 MW . The dam was named for a 3 @-@ mile ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) -wide bend in the Snake River , shaped like an oxbow , although not an oxbow lake . Hells Canyon Dam was the last and most downriver of the three , was constructed in 1967 and generates 450 MW . 
 Downriver of the Hells Canyon is the Lower Snake River Project , authorized by the Rivers and Harbors Act of 1945 , which was created by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to create a navigable channel on the Snake River from its mouth to the beginning of Hells Canyon . These dams are , in downstream order : Lower Granite Lock and Dam , Little Goose Lock and Dam , Lower Monumental Lock and Dam , and Ice Harbor Lock and Dam . Dredging work was also done throughout the length of the navigation channel to facilitate ship passage . These dams form a cascade of reservoirs with no stretches of free @-@ flowing river in between . Immediately below Ice Harbor Dam is Lake Wallula , formed by the construction of the McNary Dam on the Columbia River . ( McNary Dam is not part of the Lower Snake River Project . ) Above Lower Granite Dam , the river channel from Lewiston to Johnson Bar , just below Hells Canyon , is also maintained for jet @-@ boats as this section is too rugged for ships . These dams have been proposed for removal , and if they were to be removed , it would be the largest dam removal project ever undertaken in the United States . The removal has been proposed on the grounds that it would restore salmon runs to the lower Snake River and the Clearwater River and other smaller tributaries . Idaho 's Snake river once teemed with sockeye salmon . However , there are almost no wild sockeye salmon left in the river due to a number of factors . 
 There are many reasons why Sockeye Salmon in the Snake River are reduced in number . One reason is that the Snake river runs through 3 different states , and is over 1 @,@ 000 miles long . Salmon swimming upstream in this river are faced with predators and dams . The Snake River has fifteen dams and is extremely difficult for salmon to access because of hydroelectric dams . Hell 's Canyon Dam blocks passage to the entire upper Snake River . The Grand Cooley also blocks spawning grounds to the famous " June Hogs . " ( June Hogs were legendary Chinook Salmon that weighed over 100 pounds . ) 
 Between 1985 and 2007 , only an average of 18 sockeye salmon returned to Idaho each year . Serious conservation efforts by wildlife biologists and fish hatcheries have captured the few remaining wild sockeye salmon , collected their sperm and eggs , and in a laboratory , have them spawn . Instead of spawning naturally , these sockeye begin their lives in an incubator in a fishery biologist 's laboratory . These baby salmon then are transported by ship , bypassing the dams . ( The dams can hurt juvenile baby sockeye salmon with their powerful tides and currents , which suck the baby salmon down . ) Another conservation effort that has helped the salmon recover , is the destruction of old , outdated dams , such as the Lewiston Dam on the Clearwater River , a tributary of the Snake . After destroying the dam , salmon populations noticeably recovered . 
 Another interesting recovery method conservationists and biologists are using is called Fish Transportation . Since many juvenile salmon perish at each dam while swimming out to the ocean , massive ships filter and collect these baby salmon by size and take them out to the ocean for a ride , where they can be guaranteed to make it alive to saltwater . This method raises controversy to the effectiveness and costs , since this method is extremely expensive , almost costing $ 15 million . Another similar method to transport fish across the dams is the " Fish Gun " method . Engineers at <unk> Innovations have developed a " <unk> Fish Transport System " that literally collects salmon and shoots them above the dam at high speed in an effort to get them across the dams . 
 Overall , these combined efforts have had good success . In the summer of 2006 , the Snake River reportedly only had 3 sockeye salmon that returned to their spawning <unk> the summer of 2013 , more than 13 @,@ 000 sockeye salmon returned to the spawning grounds . 
 = = = Navigation = = = 
 In the 1960s and 1970s the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers built four dams and locks on the lower Snake River to facilitate shipping . The lower Columbia River has likewise been dammed for navigation . Thus a deep shipping channel through locks and slackwater reservoirs for heavy barges exists from the Pacific Ocean to Lewiston , Idaho . Most barge traffic originating on the Snake River goes to deep @-@ water ports on the lower Columbia River , such as Portland . Grain , mostly wheat , is the main product shipped from the Snake , and nearly all of it is exported internationally from the lower Columbia River ports . 
 The shipping channel is authorized to be at least 14 feet ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) deep and 250 feet ( 76 m ) wide . Where river depths were less than 14 feet ( 4 m ) , the shipping channel has been dredged in most places . Dredging and <unk> work is ongoing and actual depths vary over time . With a channel about 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) deeper than the Mississippi River system , the Columbia and Snake rivers can float barges twice as heavy . Agricultural products from Idaho and eastern Washington are among the main goods transported by barge on the Snake and Columbia rivers . Grain , mainly wheat , accounts for more than 85 % of the cargo barged on the lower Snake River . In 1998 , over 123 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 US bushels ( 4 @.@ 3 × 109 l ; 980 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 US dry gal ; 950 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 imp gal ) of grain were barged on the Snake . Before the completion of the lower Snake dams , grain from the region was transported by truck or rail to Columbia River ports around the Tri @-@ Cities . Other products barged on the lower Snake River include peas , lentils , forest products , and petroleum . 
 = = Biology = = 
 The World Wide Fund for Nature ( WWF ) divides the Snake River 's watershed into two freshwater ecoregions : the " Columbia Unglaciated " ecoregion and the " Upper Snake " ecoregion . Shoshone Falls marks the boundary between the two . The WWF placed the ecoregion boundary about 50 kilometres ( 31 mi ) downriver from Shoshone Falls in order to include the Big Wood River ( the main tributary of the Malad River ) in the Upper Snake ecoregion , because the Wood River is biologically distinct from the rest of the downriver Snake . Shoshone Falls has presented a total barrier to the upstream movement of fish for 30 @,@ 000 to 60 @,@ 000 years . As a result , only 35 % of the fish fauna above the falls , and 40 % of the Wood River 's fish fauna , are shared with the lower Snake River . 
 The Upper Snake freshwater ecoregion includes most of southeastern Idaho and extends into small portions of Wyoming , Utah , and Nevada , including major freshwater habitats such as Jackson Lake . Compared to the lower Snake River and the rest of the Columbia River 's watershed , the Upper Snake ecoregion has a high level of endemism , especially among freshwater molluscs such as snails and clams . There are at least 21 snail and clam species of special concern , including 15 that appear to exist only in single clusters . There are 14 fish species found in the Upper Snake region that do not occur elsewhere in the Columbia 's watershed , but which do occur in Bonneville freshwater ecoregion of western Utah , part of the Great Basin and related to the prehistoric Lake Bonneville . The Wood River sculpin ( Cottus <unk> ) is endemic to the Wood River . The Shoshone sculpin ( Cottus <unk> ) is endemic to the small portion of the Snake River between Shoshone Falls and the Wood River . 
 The Snake River below Shoshone Falls is home to thirty @-@ five native fish species , of which twelve are also found in the Columbia River and four of which are endemic to the Snake : the relict sand roller ( <unk> <unk> ) of the <unk> family , the <unk> sculpin ( Cottus <unk> ) , the <unk> sculpin ( Cottus marginatus ) , and the Oregon chub ( <unk> <unk> ) . The Oregon chub is also found in the Umpqua River and nearby basins . The lower Snake River also supports seven species of Pacific salmon and trout ( Oncorhynchus ) . There are also high , often localized levels of mollusc endemism , especially in Hells Canyon and the basins of the Clearwater River , Salmon River , and middle Snake River . The mollusc richness extends into the lower Columbia River and tributaries such as the Deschutes River . 
 = = = Animals = = = 
 Aside from aquatic species , much of the Snake River watershed supports larger animals including numerous species of mammals , birds , amphibians , and reptiles . Especially in the headwaters and the other mountainous areas strewn throughout the watershed , the gray wolf , grizzly bear , wolverine , mountain lion and Canada lynx are common . It has been determined that there are 97 species of mammals in the upper part of the Snake River , upstream from the Henrys Fork confluence . <unk> and bighorn sheep are common in the area drained by the " lost streams of Idaho " , several rivers and large creeks that flow south from the Rocky Mountains and disappear into the Snake River Aquifer . About 274 bird species , some endangered or threatened , use the Snake River watershed , including bald eagle , peregrine falcon , whooping crane , greater sage @-@ grouse , and yellow @-@ billed cuckoo . Barrow 's goldeneye are a species of bird that occurs commonly along the lower section of the Snake River . 
 Ten amphibian and twenty species of reptiles inhabit the upper Snake River 's wetland and riparian zones . Several species of frogs are common in the " lost streams " basin and the northeasternmost part of the Snake River watershed , including the inland tailed frog , northern leopard frog , western toad , Columbia spotted frog , long @-@ toed salamander , spadefoot toad . However , in the lower and middle portions of the Snake River watershed , several native species have been severely impacted by agriculture practices and the resulting non @-@ native species supported by them . Introduced birds include the gray partridge , ring @-@ necked pheasant , and chukar . Other non @-@ native species include the bullfrog , brown @-@ headed cowbird , and European starling , attracted by the construction of cities and towns . 
 = = = Plants = = = 
 The Snake River watershed includes a diversity of vegetation zones both past and present . A majority of the watershed was once covered with shrub @-@ steppe grassland , most common in the Snake River Plain and also the Columbia Plateau in southeastern Washington . Riparian zones , wetlands and marshes once occurred along the length of the Snake River and its tributaries . In higher elevations , conifer forests , of which ponderosa pine is most common , dominate the landscape . The basin ranges from semi @-@ desert to alpine climates , providing habitat for hundreds of species of plants . In the lowermost part of the watershed , in southeastern Washington , the Snake River is surrounded by an area called the Columbia Plateau <unk> , which is now mostly occupied by irrigated farms . The rest of the Plateau area is characterized by low hills , dry lakes , and an arid , nearly desert climate . 
 The headwaters of the Snake River and the high mountains elsewhere in the watershed were historically heavily forested . These include aspen , Douglas fir , and spruce fir , comprising about 20 % of the historic watershed . At the base of mountains and in the Lost River basin , sagebrush was and is the predominant vegetation cover . Because of deforestation , up to one @-@ fourth of the forests have been taken over by sagebrush , leaving the remaining forests to cover about 15 % of the watershed . However , the lodgepole pine has increased in number , taking over historic stands of other conifers . There are also up to 118 species of rare or endemic plants that occur in the Snake River watershed . 
 = = = Salmon and other anadromous fish = = = 
 The Snake River was once one of the most important rivers for the spawning of anadromous fish — which are hatched in the headwaters of rivers , live in the ocean for most of their lives , and return to the river to spawn — in the United States . The river supported species including chinook salmon , coho salmon , and sockeye salmon , as well as steelhead , white sturgeon , and Pacific lamprey . It is known that before the construction of dams on the river , there were three major chinook salmon runs in the Snake River ; in the spring , summer and fall , totaling about 120 @,@ 000 fish , and the sockeye salmon run was about 150 @,@ 000 . The historical barrier to fish migration on the Snake River was Shoshone Falls , a waterfall that occurs as the Snake River passes through the Snake River Plain . 
 Since the early 20th century , when Swan Falls Dam was constructed on the middle Snake River upstream of Hells Canyon , the fifteen dams and reservoirs on the river have posed an increasing problem for migrating salmon . Agricultural lands and their resulting runoff have also had a significant impact on the success rate of migrating fish . Salmon can travel up the Snake River as far as Hells Canyon Dam , using the fish passage facilities of the four lower Snake River dams , leaving the Clearwater , Grande Ronde and Salmon river to sustain spawning salmon . Rising in several forks in the Clearwater Mountains of central Idaho , the Clearwater and Salmon River watersheds are nearly undeveloped with the enormous exception of <unk> Dam on the North Fork Clearwater River . The watershed of the Grande Ronde in northeastern Oregon is also largely undeveloped . The four reservoirs formed by the lower Snake River dams — Lake Sacagawea , Lake Herbert G. West , Lake Bryan , and Lower Granite Lake — have also formed problems , as the downstream current in the pools is often not enough for the fish to sense , confusing their migration routes . 
 At the confluence of the Snake and Clearwater Rivers , young salmon that swim down from spawning gravels in the headwaters of the Clearwater River often delay their migrations because of a significant temperature difference . ( Prior to the removal of Lewiston Dam on the main Clearwater and Grangeville Dam on the South Fork Clearwater , the Clearwater was completely unusable by migrating salmon . ) Agricultural runoff and water held in reservoirs higher upstream on the Snake warm its waters as it flows through the Snake River Plain , so as the Snake meets the Clearwater , its average temperature is much higher . Directly below the confluence , the river flows into Lower Granite Lake , formed by Lower Granite Dam , the uppermost dam of the Lower Snake River Project . Paradoxically , the combination of these factors gives the young salmon further time to grow and to feed in Lower Granite Lake , so when they begin the migration to the Pacific Ocean , they often have a higher chance at survival , compared to those salmon who migrate to the ocean earlier . 
 = = = Lower Snake River dam removal = = = 
 A controversy has erupted since the late 20th century over the four lower Snake River dams , with the primary argument being that removing the dams would allow anadromous fish to reach the lower Snake River tributaries — the Clearwater River , the Tucannon River and the Grande Ronde River — and spawn in much higher numbers . However , removal of the dams has been fiercely opposed by some groups in the Pacific Northwest . Because much of the electricity in the Northwest comes from dams , removing the four dams would create a hole in the energy grid that would not be immediately replaceable . Navigation on the lower Snake would also suffer , as submerged riffles , rapids and islands would be exposed by the removal of the dams . Irrigation pumps for fields in southeastern Washington would also have to reach further to access the water of the Snake River . However , aside from restoring salmon runs , dam removal proponents argue that the power is replaceable , that the grain transportation system could be replaced by railroads , and that only one of the four reservoirs supplies irrigation water . <unk> in the Snake River Plain would likely need to allow less water into the Snake River during low flow in order to create a current in the four lower reservoirs , and recreation and tourism would likely benefit . 
 = = Tributaries = = 
 The Salmon River is the second largest tributary . Although the Salmon has a larger drainage than the Clearwater , the Salmon drains much drier country and therefore has a smaller discharger than the Clearwater , about 8 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 9 @.@ 9 km3 ) annually compared to about 11 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 acre feet ( 14 km3 ) annually for the Clearwater River . 
 The Snake River has over 20 major tributaries , most of which are in the mountainous regions of the basin . The largest by far is the Clearwater River , which drains 9 @,@ 000 square miles ( 23 @,@ 000 km2 ) in north central Idaho . Many of the rivers that flow into the Snake River Plain from the north sink into the Snake River Aquifer , but still contribute their water to the river . Aside from rivers , the Snake is fed by many significant springs , many of which arise from the aquifer on the west side of the plain . 
 = Diffusion damping = 
 In modern cosmological theory , diffusion damping , also called photon diffusion damping , is a physical process which reduced density inequalities ( anisotropies ) in the early universe , making the universe itself and the cosmic microwave background radiation ( CMB ) more uniform . Around 300 @,@ 000 years after the Big Bang , during the epoch of recombination , diffusing photons travelled from hot regions of space to cold ones , equalising the temperatures of these regions . This effect is responsible , along with baryon acoustic oscillations , the Doppler effect , and the effects of gravity on electromagnetic radiation , for the eventual formation of galaxies and galaxy clusters , these being the dominant large scale structures which are observed in the universe . It is a damping by diffusion , not of diffusion . 
 The strength of diffusion damping is calculated by a mathematical expression for the damping factor , which figures into the Boltzmann equation , an equation which describes the amplitude of perturbations in the CMB . The strength of the diffusion damping is chiefly governed by the distance photons travel before being scattered ( diffusion length ) . What affect the diffusion length are primarily the properties of the plasma in question : different sorts of plasma may experience different sorts of diffusion damping . The evolution of a plasma may also affect the damping process . The scale on which diffusion damping works is called the Silk scale and its value corresponds to the size of galaxies of the present day . The mass contained within the Silk scale is called the Silk mass and it corresponds to the mass of the galaxies . 
 = = Introduction = = 
 Diffusion damping took place about 13 @.@ 8 billion years ago , during the stage of the early universe called recombination or matter @-@ radiation decoupling . This period occurred about 380 @,@ 000 years after the Big Bang . This is equivalent to a redshift of around z = 1090 . Recombination was the stage during which simple atoms , e.g. hydrogen and helium , began to form in the cooling , but still very hot , soup of protons , electrons and photons that composed the universe . Prior to the recombination epoch , this soup , a plasma , was largely opaque to the electromagnetic radiation of photons . This meant that the permanently excited photons were scattered by the protons and electrons too often to travel very far in straight lines . During the recombination epoch , the universe cooled rapidly as free electrons were captured by atomic nuclei ; atoms formed from their constituent parts and the universe became transparent : the amount of photon scattering decreased dramatically . Scattering less , photons could diffuse ( travel ) much greater distances . There was no significant diffusion damping for electrons , which could not diffuse nearly as far as photons could in similar circumstances . Thus all damping by electron diffusion is negligible when compared to photon diffusion damping . 
 Acoustic perturbations of initial density fluctuations in the universe made some regions of space hotter and denser than others . These differences in temperature and density are called anisotropies . Photons diffused from the hot , <unk> regions of plasma to the cold , <unk> ones : they dragged along the protons and electrons : the photons pushed electrons along , and these , in turn , pulled on protons by the Coulomb force . This caused the temperatures and densities of the hot and cold regions to be averaged and the universe became less anisotropic ( characteristically various ) and more isotropic ( characteristically uniform ) . This reduction in anisotropy is the damping of diffusion damping . Diffusion damping thus damps temperature and density anisotropies in the early universe . With baryonic matter ( protons and electrons ) escaping the dense areas along with the photons ; the temperature and density inequalities were adiabatically damped . That is to say the ratios of photons to baryons remained constant during the damping process . 
 Photon diffusion was first described in Joseph Silk 's 1968 paper entitled " Cosmic Black @-@ Body Radiation and Galaxy Formation " , which was published in The Astrophysical Journal . As such , diffusion damping is sometimes also called Silk damping , though this term may apply only to one possible damping scenario . Silk damping was thus named after its discoverer . 
 = = Magnitude = = 
 The magnitude of diffusion damping is calculated as a damping factor or suppression factor , represented by the symbol <formula> , which figures into the Boltzmann equation , an equation which describes the amplitude of perturbations in the CMB . The strength of the diffusion damping is chiefly governed by the distance photons travel before being scattered ( diffusion length ) . What affect the diffusion length are primarily the properties of the plasma in question : different sorts of plasma may experience different sorts of diffusion damping . The evolution of a plasma may also affect the damping process . 
 <formula> 
 Where : 
 <formula> is the conformal time . 
 <formula> is the " differential optical depth for Thomson scattering " . Thomson scattering is the scattering of electromagnetic radiation ( light ) by charged particles such as electrons . 
 <formula> is the wave number of the wave being suppressed . 
 <formula> is the visibility function . 
 <formula> 
 The damping factor <formula> , when factored into the Boltzmann equation for the cosmic microwave background radiation ( CMB ) , reduces the amplitude of perturbations : 
 <formula> 
 Where : 
 <formula> is the conformal time at decoupling . 
 <formula> is the " monopole [ perturbation ] of the photon distribution function " 
 <formula> is a " gravitational @-@ potential [ perturbation ] in the Newtonian gauge " . The Newtonian gauge is a quantity with importance in the General Theory of Relativity . 
 <formula> is the effective temperature . 
 Mathematical calculations of the damping factor depend on <formula> , or the effective diffusion scale , which in turn depends on a crucial value , the diffusion length , <formula> . The diffusion length relates how far photons travel during diffusion , and comprises a finite number of short steps in random directions . The average of these steps is the Compton mean free path , and is denoted by <formula> . As the direction of these steps are randomly taken , <formula> is approximately equal to <formula> , where <formula> is the number of steps the photon takes before the conformal time at decoupling ( <formula> ) . 
 The diffusion length increases at recombination because the mean free path does , with less photon scattering occurring ; this increases the amount of diffusion and damping . The mean free path increases because the electron ionisation fraction , <formula> , decreases as ionised hydrogen and helium bind with the free , charged electrons . As this occurs , the mean free path increases proportionally : <formula> . That is , the mean free path of the photons is inversely proportional to the electron ionisation fraction and the baryon number density ( <formula> ) . That means that the more baryons there were , and the more they were ionised , the shorter the average photon could travel before encountering one and being scattered . Small changes to these values before or during recombination can augment the damping effect considerably . This dependence on the baryon density by photon diffusion allows scientists to use analysis of the latter to investigate the former , in addition to the history of ionisation . 
 The effect of diffusion damping is greatly augmented by the finite width of the surface of last scattering ( SLS ) . The finite width of the SLS means the CMB photons we see were not all emitted at the same time , and the fluctuations we see are not all in phase . It also means that during recombination , the diffusion length changed dramatically , as the ionisation fraction shifted . 
 = = = Model dependence = = = 
 In general , diffusion damping produces its effects independent of the cosmological model being studied , thereby masking the effects of other , model @-@ dependent phenomena . This means that without an accurate model of diffusion damping , scientists cannot judge the relative merits of cosmological models , whose theoretical predictions cannot be compared with observational data , this data being obscured by damping effects . For example , the peaks in the power spectrum due to acoustic oscillations are decreased in amplitude by diffusion damping . This <unk> of the power spectrum hides features of the curve , features that would otherwise be more visible . 
 Though general diffusion damping can damp perturbations in collisionless dark matter simply due to photon dispersion , the term Silk damping applies only to damping of adiabatic models of baryonic matter , which is coupled to the diffusing photons , not dark matter , and diffuses with them . Silk damping is not as significant in models of cosmological development which posit early <unk> fluctuations ( i.e. fluctuations which do not require a constant ratio of baryons and photons ) . In this case , increases in baryon density do not require a corresponding increases in photon density , and the lower the photon density , the less diffusion there would be : the less diffusion , the less damping . Photon diffusion is not dependent on the causes of the initial fluctuations in the density of the universe . 
 = = Effects = = 
 = = = Speed = = = 
 Damping occurs at two different scales , with the process working more quickly over short ranges than over longer distances . Here , a short length is one that is lower than the mean free path of the photons . A long distance is one that is greater than the mean free path , if still less than the diffusion length . On the smaller scale , perturbations are damped almost instantaneously . On the larger scale , anisotropies are decreased more slowly , with significant degradation happening within one unit of Hubble time . 
 = = = The Silk scale and the Silk mass = = = 
 Diffusion damping exponentially decreases anisotropies in the CMB on a scale ( the Silk scale ) much smaller than a degree , or smaller than approximately 3 megaparsecs . This angular scale corresponds to a <unk> moment <formula> . The mass contained within the Silk scale is the silk mass . Numerical evaluations of the Silk mass yield results on the order of <formula> solar masses at recombination and on the order of the mass of a present @-@ day galaxy or galaxy cluster in the current era . 
 <formula> 
 Scientists say diffusion damping affects small angles and corresponding anisotropies . Other effects operate on a scale called intermediate <formula> or large <formula> . Searches for anisotropies on a small scale are not as difficult as those on larger scales , partly because they may employ ground @-@ based telescopes and their results can be more easily predicted by current theoretical models . 
 = = = Galaxy formation = = = 
 Scientists study photon diffusion damping ( and CMB anisotropies in general ) because of the insight the subject provides into the question , " How did the universe come to be ? " . Specifically , primordial anisotropies in the temperature and density of the universe are supposed to be the causes of later large @-@ scale structure formation . Thus it was the amplification of small perturbations in the pre @-@ recombination universe that grew into the galaxies and galaxy clusters of the present era . Diffusion damping made the universe isotropic within distances on the order of the Silk Scale . That this scale corresponds to the size of observed galaxies ( when the passage of time is taken into account ) implies that diffusion damping is responsible for limiting the size of these galaxies . The theory is that clumps of matter in the early universe became the galaxies that we see today , and the size of these galaxies is related to the temperature and density of the clumps . 
 Diffusion may also have had a significant effect on the evolution of primordial cosmic magnetic fields , fields which may have been amplified over time to become galactic magnetic fields . However , these cosmic magnetic fields may have been damped by radiative diffusion : just as acoustic oscillations in the plasma were damped by the diffusion of photons , so were <unk> waves ( waves of ions travelling through a <unk> plasma ) . This process began before the era of neutrino decoupling and ended at the time of recombination .

 GT Advance Championship Racing ( known as Advance GTA in Japan ) is a racing game developed by MTO and published by THQ . It was a launch title for the Game Boy Advance , and was released in Japan on March 21 , 2001 , in North America on June 11 , 2001 , and in Europe on June 22 , 2001 . The game 's sequel , GT Advance 2 : Rally Racing , was released on June 30 , 2002 in North America . 
 GT Advance features forty @-@ five Japanese cars and places the player in races on thirty @-@ two tracks . Due to positive reaction to the game in Japan , THQ purchased publishing rights for the North American and European releases to the game after a reported bidding war , and added in a controversial password save system into the game to cut costs . 
 The game was received with mostly positive reviews from critics that praised the game for its fun gameplay , but THQ was criticized by most reviewers for adding passwords to the game when the Japanese version had battery @-@ backed saves . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 GT Advance Championship Racing is a customizable experience , including 48 cars from 8 car manufacturers , and 32 courses . Some of the cars featured in the game are exclusively found in Asia , such as the Nissan Cube . The courses vary between paved and dirt roads , requiring the player to adapt their driving to meet the conditions of the course they 're driving on . 
 The game 's championship mode features four levels of play , three cups of varying levels , and an unlockable " kart racing mode " . Upgrades earned through gameplay can be added to the player 's car , and in some cases , they can change the physical appearance of the vehicle . The game contains multiplayer support , allowing two people to play against each other using a Game Link Cable . 
 Controls are simple , with the A and B buttons controlling the player 's gas and brakes respectively . The R and L buttons shift the car up or down a gear in manual control , and the D @-@ Pad controls the car 's steering . The game requires the player to master the powerslide technique to skid around corners and to reduce their lap time . 
 = = = Graphics = = = 
 The roads in the game are painted on a flat plane , which allows the game to progress at a smooth rate , but makes it harder for the player to see upcoming turns in the road . The problem can be remedied by playing through a track multiple times to gain familiarity with the turns in a course . The cars are rendered through sprite frames , giving the impression of 3D graphics in the game . 
 = = = Save system = = = 
 The Japanese version of the game , Advance GTA , had save support . However , THQ pulled the battery RAM out of the North American and European releases of the game , and utilized passwords to save data instead . The system forces players of the North American and European releases to enter a sixteen digit code consisting of upper and lowercase letters , numbers , and symbols into the game to retrieve their data . Many critics blamed THQ for what was perceived to be a cost @-@ cutting measure . It was the only major change from the Japanese version of the game . 
 = = Development = = 
 MTO began development on GT Advance Championship Racing about a year before the release of the game in Japan . The game was first announced on August 18 , 2000 , under the name of Pocket GT Advance . With the exception of a new password save system , tweaking was kept to a minimum for the North American version of the game . The choice was made in the Japanese version to use mostly English in the game so it would be playable outside Japan . 
 The Japanese version of the game , Advance GTA , was praised by critics and the anticipation for the North American and European releases of the game grew . A reported bidding war between United States publishing companies to release the game in the US began after the positive feedback from the Japanese version . It was reported a month afterwards that THQ had gained the publishing rights for the game 's North American and European releases . 
 = = Reception = = 
 GT Advance Championship Racing garnered praise from critics for its overall gameplay , but the inclusion of a password save system by THQ into the North American and European releases of the game was heavily criticized . IGN 's Craig Harris praised the high quality graphics engine and the entertaining powerslide system , but observed that with regards to the password system , " ... some players ( myself included ) just might throw their hands up in disgust with what THQ has done to the game . " GameSpot observed that , " GT Advance is , at its core , a very robust and graphically impressive racing game . " Despite praising the gameplay , however , GameSpot recommended that players buy a Japanese import version of the game instead , since it was in English and included a battery save feature .

 = Kristins Hall = 
 Kristins Hall is an arena located at Stampesletta in Lillehammer , Norway . It consist of an ice rink , a combined handball and floorball court , and a curling rink . The venue , owned and operated by the Lillehammer Municipality , opened in 1988 and cost 65 million Norwegian krone ( NOK ) to build . One of the motivations for its construction was to help Lillehammer 's bid to be selected as the host of the 1994 Winter Olympics . The ice rink has a capacity for 3 @,@ 194 spectators and is the home rink of GET @-@ ligaen hockey club Lillehammer IK . Kristins Hall is located next to the larger Håkons Hall , which opened in 1993 . During the 1994 Winter Olympics , Kristins Hall was a training rink , and subsequently hosted the ice sledge hockey tournament at the 1994 Winter Paralympics . The venue also co @-@ hosted Group B of the 1989 World Ice Hockey Championships .

 Plans for an ice rink in Lillehammer started in the 1980s with the Lillehammer bid for the 1992 Winter Olympics . In 1985 , Lillehammer Municipal Council accepted an agreement with the Norwegian Confederation of Sports ( NIF ) , which offered to finance 50 percent of a new multi @-@ use arena in Lillehammer . Combined with the construction of the skiing resort Hafjell , it was part of a plan to document the construction of new venues in and around Lillehammer to help the town secure the right to host the Olympics . The construction received NOK 25 million in state grants . To promote the Olympic bid , the venue was given priority by NIF in their recommendation for use of public grants . In May 1987 , the municipal council stated that they did not want to apply to host the B @-@ Group of the 1989 World Ice Hockey Championships , because they feared the venue would not be completed by November 1987 . NIF President Hans B. <unk> stated that this could jeopardize the entire Olympic bid if Lillehammer withdrew from arranging such a small event . The decision was changed a week later . The venue opened in December 1988 and cost NOK 65 million . 
 After Lillehammer was awarded the 1994 Winter Olympics in 1988 , it became necessary to build a larger venue to hold the Olympic ice hockey matches . The name of the arena was decided by the Lillehammer Municipal Council in October 1988 , as part of a broader branding policy , based on the history of the Birkebeiner . Originally the administration had suggested the new larger hall be named Håkons Hall , after Haakon Haakonarson , later king of Norway , while the smaller hall would be named <unk> Hall , for Sverre Sigurdsson . During the political debate , a number of female councilors suggested that the smaller hall be named Kristins Hall , for Sigurdsson 's daughter Kristina <unk> , which was passed by the city council . Kristin and Håkon would be used to name the mascots for the Olympics . Kristins Hall has had small renovations throughout the years , including an upgrade in 2007 which included new ice hockey sideboards , a new ice machine , a new lighting system , and a new handball floor . 
 = = Facilities = = 
 The municipally owns and operates venue is located at Stampesletta , about 1 kilometer ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) from the town center of Lillehammer , Norway . With a gross area of 9 @,@ 000 square meters ( 97 @,@ 000 sq ft ) , it consists of three main sections : an ice hockey rink , a combined handball and floorball court , and a curling rink . The venue has eight locker rooms , of which two are designed for judges and referees , a weight room , a 100 @-@ meter ( 330 ft ) long , four @-@ track sprint track , meeting rooms , three kiosks , VIP facilities and a cafeteria . The handball hall has an artificial surface measuring 22 by 44 meters ( 72 by 144 ft ) . 
 The ice rink is certified by the Norwegian Ice Hockey Association to hold 3 @,@ 197 spectators , but can accommodate up to 4 @,@ 000 people in special circumstances . The cooling and heating systems for Håkons Hall and Kristins Hall are connected , allowing them to function as energy reserves for each other .

 The ice rink is the home of Lillehammer IK , which plays in GET @-@ ligaen , the premier ice hockey league in Norway . During the season , they play one to two home games per week , typically attracting crowds of 1 @,@ 000 to 1 @,@ 500 spectators . They inaugurated the arena in December 1988 with a game against <unk> . The ice rink is also used by the Norwegian College of Elite Sport in Lillehammer and Lillehammer <unk> . The handball court is used by Lillehammer <unk> and <unk> IL , while the curling rink is used by Lillehammer <unk> . The venue is owned and operated by Lillehammer Municipality . 
 The official opening of the venue took place on 12 December 1988 , when Norway played West Germany . Kristins Hall held two more Norwegian friendly internationals during the season , before it was host to the B @-@ Group during the 1989 World Ice Hockey Championships . Ten games were played in Lillehammer , including the opening game between Norway and Japan , while 18 games were played in Oslo . During the 1994 Winter Olympics , Kristins Hall was used as a training venue for the ice hockey teams , which played their games at Håkons Hall and Gjøvik Olympic Cavern Hall . During the 1994 Winter Paralympics , Kristins Hall hosted the ice sledge hockey tournament . Lillehammer is scheduled to host the 2016 Winter Youth Olympics , with Kristins Hall to be used for curling and ice hockey . This involves an expansion of the curling rink to satisfy international requirements , including expansion of the spectator capacity . 
 = Washington Park Historic District ( Albany , New York ) = 
 Washington Park in Albany , New York is the city 's premier park and the site of many festivals and gatherings . As public property it dates back to the city charter in 1686 , and has seen many uses including that of gunpowder storage , square / parade grounds , and cemetery . The park is often mistaken as being designed by Frederick Law Olmsted , but does incorporate many of the philosophical ideals used by Olmsted when he designed Central Park in Manhattan . The park is about 81 acres ( 33 ha ) in size with the 5 @.@ 2 @-@ acre ( 2 @.@ 1 ha ) Washington Park Lake , a roughly 1 @,@ 600 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 490 m ) and 140 @-@ foot @-@ wide ( 43 m ) lake , in the southwestern corner . 
 Not only is the park historic , but so is the mostly residential surrounding neighborhood . Many architectural works line the streets facing the park , designed by some of the most famous architects of the late 19th century , including Henry Hobson Richardson . At least two governors of New York lived in buildings facing Washington Park outside of their term in office . Due to the historical and architectural significance of the park and neighborhood both were included in 1972 as the Washington Park Historic District ; and in 1998 the park was named one of the nation 's 100 most important parks by the American Association of Architects . In 2008 Boston @-@ based composer Peter Child wrote an orchestral piece inspired by the park , entitled Washington Park .

 Washington Park has been public property since the Dongan Charter was granted to Albany incorporating it as a city . The charter specified that all land not privately owned at the time became property of the Mayor , Aldermen , and Commonalty of the city of Albany , including the land that would become the site of Washington Park . A portion of the land was set aside for a structure built to house gunpowder in 1802 , and in 1806 the areas between Willett and Knox streets , and between State Street and Madison Avenue , became the Middle Public Square . In 1800 , the land west of Knox Street to Robin Street and south from State Street to Hudson Avenue was taken for a cemetery , which was apportioned into sections for each of Albany 's churches . There were separate sections for African @-@ Americans and for strangers . West of the cemetery was the alms @-@ house farm and the penitentiary grounds . In 1809 the Middle Public Square was renamed Washington Square , and later the Washington Parade Ground . In 1868 the remains and headstones in the cemetery were removed and reinterred , most to Albany Rural Cemetery , and some to the cemeteries of other churches . 
 For years leading up to the creation of the park , the leading citizens and newspapers in Albany had pushed for a grand public park . Frederick Law Olmsted 's Olmsted , Vaux and Company was hired in 1869 to plan such a park . In their plan they envisioned Washington Park as the centerpiece of a string of parks and boulevards similar to those they had designed in Buffalo , Boston , and Brooklyn . Though Olmsted and his company was not involved in the actual design of the park , their broad vision was followed for the detailed designs , including the idea of damming the Beaver Kill ( Beaver Creek ) to form a grand lake . 
 = = = Construction of the park = = = 
 The New York Legislature passed a law in 1869 authorizing the creation of a large public park on the spot and the creation of the Board of Trustees of the Washington Park of the City of Albany ( later Commissioners ) . John Bogart and John Cuyler drew the plans for Washington Park in 1870 . Bogart had worked for Olmsted and Vaux on Central Park in New York and later Bogart was the chief engineer for the New York City Department of Parks from 1872 to 1877 . From 1869 to 1872 R.H. Bingham was the chief engineer in charge of the drafting of the plans and the supervision of construction , after 1872 his assistant William S. Egerton took charge . It was under Egerton that the formal garden settings were planted . 
 Work on the Washington Parade Grounds between Willett and Knox streets was begun in July 1870 and finished by the end of the year . During 1871 the former cemetery was landscaped and that area reopened as part of the park . The section of Washington Park between Lexington ( formerly Snipe ) and Robin streets was the focus of work in 1873 , including the damming of the Beaverkill to form Washington Park Lake . In 1874 focus shifted to roughly 15 acres ( 61 @,@ 000 m2 ) along Madison Avenue from Lake to Robin and a footbridge was built over the lake in 1875 . Nine acres of mostly row houses along Knox Street north of Madison were purchased , destroyed , and landscaped in 1880 ; this included the area that would be the site of the King Memorial Fountain . The large house and landscaped grounds of John Taylor was the last part of the park to be purchased , in 1882 , since 1889 it has been the site of tennis courts . The northwestern corner that is cut out of the park 's otherwise rectangular shape was never part of the park ; those plots were mostly owned by the Barnes family and developed into urban mansions facing Thurlow Terrace and Englewood Place . The process of buying and improving the land piecemeal was criticized because each improvement raised the value of the existing land that still needed to be purchased . The increase in property value can be shown through the value of the lands surrounding Washington Park almost doubling in the six years in which the majority of the park improvements were made ; from $ 2 @,@ 696 @,@ 688 in 1869 to $ 4 @,@ 843 @,@ 440 in 1875 . The properties next to Washington Park on Robin Street , which was renamed Englewood Terrace , increased in value from $ 9 @,@ 500 in 1875 to $ 175 @,@ 800 by 1891 . 
 The Commissioners were given by the state additional powers to build and maintain approaches to the park and other parks as well , this allowed the commissioners to build a series of boulevards around the city . Western Avenue from the northwestern corner of Washington Park to the location of the toll gate of the Western Turnpike was under the purview of the commissioners . Work on the road began in late 1876 and was finished the next year . The total construction cost of the park , including purchasing the real estate and improving Western Avenue , was $ 1 @,@ 073 @,@ 020 @.@ 91 . In 1878 Northern Boulevard ( today Manning Boulevard ) was constructed by the commissioners , it extended from the western end of their jurisdiction on Western Avenue north and east to the intersection of Clinton and Central avenues . In 1896 the state legislature also gave the commissioners authority over Lake Avenue from the park corner at Madison Avenue south to New Scotland Avenue ( then- Albany , Schoharie , and Rensselaerville Plank Road ) . In addition to boulevards the Commissioners of Washington Park also gained control of other existing parks , and built new ones throughout the city , including Academy Park , Bleeker Park , Hudson Avenue Park , Clinton Square , Rensselaer Park , St. Joseph 's Park , Townsend Park , Beaver Park ( later Lincoln Park ) , and the former grounds of the Dudley Observatory . In 1900 the board of commissioners was transformed into the Bureau of Parks in the Department of Public Works and later the bureau became a separate department . 
 = = = Modern times = = = 
 In 1958 Lancaster Street , which had previously ended at Willett Street opposite the park , was extended through to Northern Boulevard ( today Henry Johnson Boulevard ) . Associated with this extension Northern Boulevard was also widened and both Lancaster and State streets were turned into one @-@ ways . Entrances to Washington Park from Thurlow Terrace and Englewood Place were closed in 1972 turning those into dead end streets from Western Avenue . In 1988 Washington Park Road was renamed Albany Plan of Union Avenue in honor of the colonial congress held in Albany by Benjamin Franklin that proposed closer ties and support among the Thirteen Colonies . In 1991 Northern Boulevard from its intersection with Madison Avenue and Willett Street north through the park and continuing to Livingston Avenue in Arbor Hill was renamed Henry Johnson Boulevard in honor of African @-@ American World War I hero Henry Johnson . 
 In the 1950s Dutch elm disease ( <unk> ulmi ) killed off all the elms that once populated the park and crab apples were planted to replace the elms along the pedestrian mall . After deteriorating over the decades Washington Park saw a revival in the 1990s and 2000s with the flower beds being restored to their original specifications , the pedestrian mall removed of pavement and widened to its original dimensions with disease @-@ resistant elms planted to form a canopy , the King Fountain relit at night , and the lilac shrub border around the periphery of the park being restored . 
 = = Structures = = 
 Originally Washington Park included many buildings : several shelters of untrimmed logs , a pavilion , wellhouse , croquet shelter , and <unk> once dotted the landscape . The wooden lake house was replaced in 1929 with a " modern " brick structure while the others over time succumbed to age and changing use @-@ patterns for the park and no longer stand . The footbridge over Washington Park Lake is the only remaining original structure in Washington Park ; erected over the lake in 1875 the lamps on the bridge were originally gas burning but were electrified in 1881 . 
 The current Washington Park Lake House was built in 1929 replacing the original stick style structure constructed in 1876 . It is constructed in the Spanish Revival style with terracotta , terrazzo , brick , and <unk> tile . The area in front of the lake house has been the site for the performance of plays by the Park Playhouse for over 20 years . A 900 @-@ seat amphitheater faces the lake house allowing for comfortable seating for the over 60 @,@ 000 people who visit every year . A proposal by the city to turn the lake house into a 125 @-@ seat restaurant and 200 @-@ seat banquet hall with an expanded dock with boat , cross @-@ country ski , and ice skate rentals failed to materialize due to a lack of interest from the private business sector .

 Robert Burns Statue is a bronze statue erected in 1888 , with four panels around the base installed in 1891 . It is of the famous Scottish poet Robert Burns , his statue was sculpted by Charles Calverley and each of the four panels around the base have one of Burns ' poems carved by George H. Boughton . The Saint Andrew 's Society funded conservation of the statue in 1978 . 
 King Memorial Fountain is a fountain erected in 1893 with a monumental bronze statue of Moses smiting the rock for water on Mount <unk> . Four figures of Israelite slaves around the statue on the side of the mountain represent the four stages of life : infancy , youth , adulthood , and old age . The fountain is in the center of formal gardens laid out by William S. Egerton . It was a gift from Rufus H. King and was sculpted by J. Massey Rhind , who also sculpted the Philip Schuyler statue that stands at the center of the intersection of Eagle Street and Washington Avenue in front of city hall . In 1988 , the statue of Moses was cleaned and applied with a wax coating to protect it from the weather , and an arm was reattached to one of the four other statues on the fountain . 
 Marinus Willett Memorial is a monument to Colonel Marinus Willett commemorating his combat and character during the French and Indian Wars . It consists of a 33 @,@ 000 @-@ pound ( 15 @,@ 000 kg ) boulder from the " scenes of conflict " he fought in , and the plaque is dedicated to his " patriotic services in defense of Albany and the people of the Mohawk " . The boulder was placed by the Sons of the American Revolution in 1907 , facing towards an entrance to the park from the corner of State and Willett streets , an entrance that no longer exists . The boulder 's back faced Henry Johnson Boulevard ( formerly Northern Boulevard ) and was the scene of many vehicular accidents as drivers missed a sharp curve . In 2006 , as part of the 200th anniversary of the park , the boulder was moved 60 yards ( 55 m ) to the corner of State and Willett . 
 Soldiers and Sailors ' Monument is a marble monument sitting on a granite base with a bronze statue representing the Nation , holding the palms of victory . The monument is built of Tennessee marble above the seat and the remainder is of Stony Creek granite .

It sits at the Henry Johnson Boulevard entrance from State Street to the park . The monument represents " The Nation at Peace Won Through Victorious War " . It was finished in 1911 by American Sculptor Hermon A. MacNeil and erected in 1912 by the Grand Army of the Republic as a monument to Civil War veterans . The monument was restored in 1986 and renamed the Albany Veterans Memorial Monument with an unveiling by two 85 @-@ year @-@ old women who , as 12 @-@ year @-@ olds , had unveiled the monument when it was first erected in 1912 .

 State Street is a one @-@ way eastbound street along Washington Park 's northern border . Over 60 townhouses sit on State Street facing the park , most are of brick or brownstone and three stories tall . Many of these homes were built for industrialists , bankers , railroad executives , and politicians by notable national architects such as Henry Hobson Richardson and Stanford White , and local ones such as Marcus T. Reynolds and Albert Fuller . Many of the buildings have fine details such as decorative tiles , terracotta , or stone . On the corner of State and Willett is located the First Presbyterian Church , designed by J. Cleveland Cady in 1882 , and the church is noted for its four Tiffany windows . New York Governor John Alden Dix lived at 491 State Street before and after his term in office . 423 State Street is owned by the University at Albany and used by its Center for Legislative Development .

 = Heart of Stone ( Star Trek : Deep Space Nine ) = 
 " Heart of Stone " is the fourteenth episode of the third season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , and originally aired on February 6 , 1995 in broadcast syndication . The story was written by Ira Steven Behr and Robert Hewitt Wolfe , while the episode was directed by Alexander Singer and the score was created by David Bell . 
 Set in the 24th century , the series follows the adventures on Deep Space Nine , a space station located near a stable wormhole between the Alpha and Gamma quadrants of the Milky Way Galaxy . In this episode , Odo ( René Auberjonois ) and Major Kira Nerys ( Nana Visitor ) are trapped on a small moon near the Badlands , while on the station Nog ( Aron Eisenberg ) tries to get Commander Benjamin Sisko 's ( Avery Brooks ) support for his application to Starfleet Academy . 
 The idea behind the main plot was inspired by a scene from the novel Sometimes a Great Notion . However , the rock prop used was unpopular with the cast and crew , and post @-@ production effects were required . The episode was the first of an ongoing plot thread with Nog entering Starfleet , which initially concerned Eisenberg as he thought he was being written out of the show . The episode was the fourth most watched episode of the third series , with 8 @.@ 3 million viewers . Critical response was mixed , with negative comments directed at the idea that the situation was created by the female Founder ( Salome Jens ) .

 On board a Runabout , Odo ( René Auberjonois ) and Major Kira Nerys ( Nana Visitor ) are in pursuit of a Maquis vessel in the Badlands . They pursue the vessel to a small moon and land nearby . They find that the Maquis vessel is empty , and split up to search for the pilot . After a short while , Odo comes across Kira , whose foot is caught in an expanding crystal mass . Odo is unable to either remove the crystal from Kira , or transport Kira back to the Runabout . 
 Meanwhile , on Deep Space Nine , Nog ( Aron Eisenberg ) attempts to convince Commander Benjamin Sisko to endorse his application to join Starfleet Academy . Sisko gives the Ferengi the task of counting the inventory of a cargo bay , which he completes quickly but Sisko still has doubts . On the moon , Kira is slowly being covered by the crystal and insists that Odo leave her as there are increasing seismic tremors . He attempts to free her using an ultrasonic generator , and reveals some personal information to her as they wait for the crystal to shatter . As the crystal slowly swallows her whole after the generator fails to work , and the tremors become even worse , Odo confesses his love for Kira . To his surprise , she says that she is in love with him too . 
 On DS9 , Sisko informs Nog that he will not give him a recommendation as he has concerns that it is a scheme . Nog confesses that he wants to do it so that he doesn 't turn out like his father Rom ( Max Grodénchik ) , whom he describes as an engineering genius but his culture won 't let him pursue it . Sisko responds by agreeing to recommend Nog to the Academy . Odo is suspicious of Kira 's responses and points a phaser at her , demanding to know who she is . Kira and the crystal suddenly morph into the female Founder ( Salome Jens ) , who reveals that she was the Maquis all along and she was hoping to convince Odo to return to the Dominion . She reveals the location of the real Kira and transports away . Odo finds Kira and tells her of the Founder , but not of his feelings for her . 
 = = Production = = 
 Ira Steven Behr and Robert Hewitt Wolfe conceived the story and wrote the script for " Heart of Stone " , and intended the Odo / Kira storyline to be the A @-@ Plot . Behr later thought that the performances of Eisenberg and Brooks elevated the Nog / Sisko story to equal status and would result in a better reaction by fans . The idea of having a character trapped was taken from the Ken Kesey novel Sometimes a Great Notion in which a character is trapped under a log and drowned by rising water . Behr described the same scene in the 1971 film as " a great scene in a not so great movie " . The episode was intended to be low budget , but heavy on characterisation . At one point it was intended for Odo to sing the 1955 Richard Berry song " Louie Louie " , which the character described as a sea shanty , but producers couldn 't acquire the rights in time . 
 The cast and crew were unhappy with the rock prop used in the episode . Visual effects supervisor Glenn Neufeld strapped Visitor 's feet to the stage in order to ensure that the crystal didn 't move . Different versions of the crystal were then applied for different scenes , with the larger versions incorporating a seat for the actress so that she could relax inside the prop between takes . The prop caused problems for Visitor due to her claustrophobia , which was the second time during season three that a Wolfe scripted episode had caused her these types of problems after " Second Skin " . She also didn 't like how it appeared on screen : " I thought it was going to look like my body turning to stone . Instead I looked like a big old hot fudge sundae , and my head was the cherry on top . " 
 Director Alexander Singer admitted that the prop wasn 't what they envisioned , and work was conducted on it post @-@ production to improve it . Post @-@ production was also problematic as there were several morphing scenes involving Odo and the female Founder , which required reactions by other actors . Neufeld said that none of what they were aiming for worked in post @-@ production , but it was saved by the visual effects company VisionArt who managed to salvage the work . Jens agreed to re @-@ appear as the female Founder she had previously appeared as in " The Search " , and for her credit to only appear in the closing credits so as to avoid spoiling the twist in the Odo / Kira plot . Eisenberg was initially panicked by the script that showed Nog going to Starfleet Academy as he thought the character was being written out of the show , but executive producer Rick Berman assured him that it wouldn 't be the case . He later said that the scene where Nog talks to Sisko about his father was his favourite scene in the series .

 Children had featured in Star Trek as major series characters since Wesley Crusher in Star Trek : The Next Generation . The character of Crusher had attended Starfleet Academy , but leaves Starfleet in the seventh season episode " Journey 's End " , aired in February 1994 . Jake Sisko was a major character in Deep Space Nine , but had expressed a desire to be a writer rather than join Starfleet in the sixth episode of the third season , " The Abandoned " . There was a desire to avoid the Crusher " chosen one " type storyline with Sisko , but after " The Abandoned " it was seen that there would no longer be a young character progressing through Starfleet as previously intended . Wolfe said that " Of Wesley , Jake , Alexander , and Nog , wouldn 't it be funny if Nog were the one to end up as a Starfleet captain ? " . Ronald D. Moore agreed with the new character direction , saying that " Somehow , Captain Nog sounds cool " . 
 Nog 's progression through Starfleet was followed in later episodes , with the character promoted to the rank of Lieutenant Junior Grade by the time of the series finale , " What You Leave Behind " . Odo 's unrequited love for Kira had been hinted at throughout season three building up to the reveal in " Heart of Stone " , which would be a repeating plot device up until the final episode of the series when Odo departs the crew . 
 = = Reception and home media release = = 
 " Heart of Stone " was first broadcast on February 6 , 1995 in broadcast syndication . It received Nielsen ratings of 8 @.@ 3 million . This placed it in fourth place in the timeslot . This was an increase from the episode aired the previous week , as " Life Support " gained a rating of 8 @.@ 2 million . It was the fourth most viewed episode of the season on first broadcast after " The Search " , " Defiant " and " Meridian " . 
 Several reviewers re @-@ watched the episode after the end of the series . Zack Handlen reviewed the episode for the A.V. Club in October 2012 . He had reservations about the episode up until the twist involving the Founder , and thought that Visitor 's performance as Kira had been slightly off all episode . He thought that having Kira admit her feelings for Odo was rushed and was disappointed by it and felt it ruined what he had considered to be one of the best episodes of the season . However , he was pleased that Odo was as suspicious as he was , and the twist was made all the more striking by the performances . He felt that the Nog / Sisko story was just as good , having felt that Nog had been " off @-@ putting " previously but the performance by Eisenberg in " Heart of Stone " was " amazing " . He particularly praised Nog 's monologue explaining his motives to join Starfleet , and said it was " terrific " as it was " exciting because it ’ s unexpected " . 
 Jamahl Epsicokhan reviewed the episode for his website " Heart of Stone " . He felt that the main Odo / Kira plot was " contrived " in that the female Founder stole a Maquis ship and set up the entire situation simply to attempt to convince Odo to return to his people . He said that the Nog and Sisko plot was " lightweight but amiable " , and he gave the episode an overall score of 2 @.@ 5 out of 4 . Michelle Erica Green watched the episode for the website TrekNation , and also questioned the main plot . She wrote " what was the shapeshifter going to do if someone OTHER than Kira was in the runabout with Odo ? Did she sit around and wait for the two of them to leave the station together ? " She had further concerns about the direction of the Odo and Kira relationship , and described the romance as a " cop @-@ out " . She thought that Odo 's declaration of his feelings felt forced , but that the plot featuring a crystal creature attacking a crew member reminded her of something from Star Trek : The Original Series . 
 The first home media release of " Heart of Stone " was as a two episode VHS cassette alongside " Life Support " in the United Kingdom on June 12 , 1995 . This was followed in the United States and Canada with a single episode release on October 5 , 1999 . It was later released on DVD as part of the season three box set on June 3 , 2003 . 
 = Oskar Schindler = 
 Oskar Schindler ( 28 April 1908 – 9 October 1974 ) was a German industrialist , spy , and member of the Nazi Party who is credited with saving the lives of 1 @,@ 200 Jews during the Holocaust by employing them in his enamelware and ammunitions factories , which were located in occupied Poland and the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia . He is the subject of the 1982 novel Schindler 's Ark , and the subsequent 1993 film Schindler 's List , which reflected his life as an opportunist initially motivated by profit who came to show extraordinary initiative , tenacity and dedication to save the lives of his Jewish employees . 
 Schindler grew up in Zwittau , Moravia , and worked in several trades until he joined the Abwehr , the intelligence service of Nazi Germany , in 1936 . He joined the Nazi Party in 1939 . Prior to the German occupation of Czechoslovakia in 1938 , he collected information on railways and troop movements for the German government . He was arrested for espionage by the Czech government but was released under the terms of the Munich Agreement in 1938 . Schindler continued to collect information for the Nazis , working in Poland in 1939 before the invasion of Poland at the start of World War II . 
 In 1939 , Schindler acquired an enamelware factory in Kraków , Poland , which employed about 1 @,@ 750 workers , of whom 1 @,@ 000 were Jews at the factory 's peak in 1944 . His Abwehr connections helped Schindler to protect his Jewish workers from deportation and death in the Nazi concentration camps . As time went on , Schindler had to give Nazi officials ever larger bribes and gifts of luxury items obtainable only on the black market to keep his workers safe . 
 By July 1944 , Germany was losing the war , the SS began closing down the easternmost concentration camps and deporting the remaining prisoners westward . Many were killed in Auschwitz and Gross @-@ Rosen concentration camp . Schindler convinced SS @-@ Hauptsturmführer Amon Göth , commandant of the nearby Kraków @-@ Płaszów concentration camp , to allow him to move his factory to Brünnlitz in the Sudetenland , thus sparing his workers from certain death in the gas chambers . Using names provided by Jewish Ghetto Police officer Marcel Goldberg , Göth 's secretary Mietek Pemper compiled and typed the list of 1 @,@ 200 Jews who travelled to Brünnlitz in October 1944 . Schindler continued to bribe SS officials to prevent the execution of his workers until the end of World War II in Europe in May 1945 , by which time he had spent his entire fortune on bribes and black @-@ market purchases of supplies for his workers . 
 Schindler moved to West Germany after the war , where he was supported by assistance payments from Jewish relief organisations . After receiving a partial reimbursement for his wartime expenses , he moved with his wife , Emilie , to Argentina , where they took up farming . When he went bankrupt in 1958 , Schindler left his wife and returned to Germany , where he failed at several business ventures and relied on financial support from Schindlerjuden ( " Schindler Jews " ) – the people whose lives he had saved during the war . He was named Righteous Among the Nations by the Israeli government in 1963 . He died on 9 October 1974 in Hildesheim , Germany , and was buried in Jerusalem on Mount Zion , the only member of the Nazi Party to be honoured in this way . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Schindler was born on 28 April 1908 , into a Sudeten German family in Zwittau , Moravia , Austria @-@ Hungary . His father was Johann " Hans " Schindler , the owner of a farm machinery business , and his mother was Franziska " Fanny " Schindler ( née <unk> ) . His sister , Elfriede , was born in 1915 . After attending primary and secondary school , Schindler enrolled in a technical school , from which he was expelled in 1924 for forging his report card . He later graduated , but did not take the Abitur exams that would have enabled him to go to college or university . Instead he took courses in Brno in several trades , including chauffeuring and machinery , and worked for his father for three years . A fan of motorcycles since his youth , Schindler bought a 250 @-@ cc Moto <unk> racing motorcycle and competed recreationally in mountain races for the next few years . 
 On 6 March 1928 , Schindler married Emilie <unk> ( 1907 – 2001 ) , daughter of a prosperous Sudeten German farmer from <unk> . The young couple moved in with Oskar 's parents and occupied the upstairs rooms , where they lived for the next seven years . Soon after his marriage , Schindler quit working for his father and took a series of jobs , including a position at Moravian <unk> and the management of a driving school . After an 18 @-@ month stint in the Czech army , where he rose to the rank of Lance @-@ Corporal in the Tenth Infantry Regiment of the 31st Army , Schindler returned to Moravian <unk> , which went bankrupt shortly afterwards . His father 's farm machinery business closed around the same time , leaving Schindler unemployed for a year . He took a job with <unk> Simek Bank of Prague in 1931 , where he worked until 1938 . 
 Schindler was arrested several times in 1931 and 1932 for public drunkenness . Also around this time he had an affair with Aurelie Schlegel , a school friend . She bore him a daughter , Emily , in 1933 , and a son , Oskar Jr , in 1935 . Schindler later claimed the boy was not his son . Schindler 's father , an alcoholic , abandoned his wife in 1935 . She died a few months later after a lengthy illness . 
 = = Spy = = 
 Schindler joined the separatist Sudeten German Party in 1935 . Although he was a citizen of Czechoslovakia , Schindler became a spy for the Abwehr , the intelligence service of Nazi Germany , in 1936 . He was assigned to <unk> II Commando VIII , based in Breslau . He later told Czech police that he did it because he needed the money ; by this time Schindler had a drinking problem and was chronically in debt . His tasks for the Abwehr included collecting information on railways , military installations , and troop movements , as well as recruiting other spies within Czechoslovakia , in advance of a planned invasion of the country by Nazi Germany . He was arrested by the Czech government for espionage on 18 July 1938 and immediately imprisoned , but was released as a political prisoner under the terms of the Munich Agreement , the instrument under which the Czech Sudetenland was annexed into Germany on 1 October . Schindler applied for membership in the Nazi Party on 1 November and was accepted the following year . 
 After some time off to recover in Zwittau , Schindler was promoted to second in command of his Abwehr unit and relocated with his wife to Ostrava , on the Czech @-@ Polish border , in January 1939 . He was involved in espionage in the months leading up to Hitler 's seizure of the remainder of Czechoslovakia in March . Emilie helped him with paperwork , processing and hiding secret documents in their apartment for the Abwehr office . As he frequently travelled to Poland on business , he and his 25 agents were in a position to collect information about Polish military activities and railways for the planned invasion of Poland . One assignment called for his unit to monitor and provide information about the railway line and tunnel in the Jablunkov Pass , deemed critical for the movement of German troops . Schindler continued to work for Abwehr until as late as fall 1940 , when he was sent to Turkey to investigate corruption among the Abwehr officers assigned to the German embassy there .

 = = = Emalia = = = 
 Schindler first arrived in Kraków in October 1939 on Abwehr business and took an apartment the following month . Emilie maintained the apartment in Ostrava and visited Oskar in Kraków at least once a week . In November 1939 , he contacted interior decorator Mila Pfefferberg to decorate his new apartment . Her son , Leopold " Poldek " Pfefferberg , soon became one of his contacts for black market trading . They eventually became lifelong friends . Also that November , Schindler was introduced to Itzhak Stern , an accountant for Schindler 's fellow Abwehr agent Josef " Sepp " Aue , who had taken over Stern 's formerly Jewish @-@ owned place of employment as a <unk> ( trustee ) . Property belonging to Polish Jews , including their possessions , places of business , and homes were seized by the Germans beginning immediately after the invasion , and Jewish citizens were stripped of their civil rights . Schindler showed Stern the balance sheet of a company he was thinking of acquiring , an enamelware factory called Rekord Ltd owned by a consortium of Jewish businessmen that had filed for bankruptcy earlier that year . Stern advised him that rather than running the company as a trusteeship under the auspices of the <unk> Ost ( Main Trustee Office for the East ) , he should buy or lease the business , as that would give him more freedom from the dictates of the Nazis , including the freedom to hire more Jews . With the financial backing of several Jewish investors , Schindler signed an informal lease agreement on the factory on 13 November 1939 and formalised the arrangement on 15 January 1940 . He renamed it Deutsche <unk> @-@ Fabrik ( German <unk> Factory ) or DEF , and it soon became known by the nickname " Emalia " . He initially acquired a staff of seven Jewish workers ( including Abraham Bankier , who helped him manage the company ) and 250 non @-@ Jewish Poles . At its peak in 1944 , the business employed around 1 @,@ 750 workers , a thousand of whom were Jews . Schindler also helped run Schlomo Wiener Ltd , a wholesale outfit that sold his enamelware , and was leaseholder of <unk> <unk> , a glass factory . 
 Schindler 's ties with the Abwehr and his connections in the Wehrmacht and its Armaments Inspectorate enabled him to obtain contracts to produce enamel cookware for the military . These connections also later helped him protect his Jewish workers from deportation and death . As time went on , Schindler had to give Nazi officials ever larger bribes and gifts of luxury items obtainable only on the black market to keep his workers safe . Bankier , a key black market connection , obtained goods for bribes as well as extra materials for use in the factory . Schindler himself enjoyed a lavish lifestyle and pursued extramarital relationships with his secretary , Viktoria <unk> , and Eva Kisch Scheuer , a merchant specialising in enamelware from DEF . Emilie Schindler visited for a few months in 1940 and moved to Kraków to live with Oskar in 1941 . 
 Initially , Schindler was mostly interested in the money @-@ making potential of the business and hired Jews because they were cheaper than Poles – the wages were set by the occupying Nazi regime . Later he began shielding his workers without regard for cost . The status of his factory as a business essential to the war effort became a decisive factor enabling him to help his Jewish workers . Whenever Schindlerjuden ( Schindler Jews ) were threatened with deportation , he claimed exemptions for them . Wives , children , and even persons with disabilities were claimed to be necessary mechanics and metalworkers . On one occasion , the Gestapo came to Schindler demanding that he hand over a family with forged identity papers . " Three hours after they walked in , " Schindler said , " two drunk Gestapo men reeled out of my office without their prisoners and without the incriminating documents they had demanded . " 
 On 1 August 1940 , Governor @-@ General Hans Frank issued a decree requiring all Kraków Jews to leave the city within the next two weeks . Only those who had jobs directly related to the German war effort would be allowed to stay . Of the 60 @,@ 000 to 80 @,@ 000 Jews then living in the city , only 15 @,@ 000 remained by March 1941 . These Jews were then forced to leave their traditional neighbourhood of Kazimierz and relocate to the walled Kraków Ghetto , established in the industrial Podgórze district . Schindler 's workers travelled on foot to and from the ghetto each day to their jobs at the factory . <unk> to the facility in the four years Schindler was in charge included the addition of an outpatient clinic , co @-@ op , kitchen , and dining room for the workers , in addition to expansion of the factory and its related office space . 
 = = = Płaszów = = = 
 In fall 1941 the Nazis began transporting Jews out of the ghetto . Most of these were sent to Belzec extermination camp and killed . On 13 March 1943 the ghetto was liquidated and those still fit for work were sent to the new concentration camp at Płaszów . Several thousand not deemed fit for work were sent to extermination camps and killed . Hundreds more were killed on the streets by the Nazis as they cleared out the ghetto . Schindler , aware of the planned action because of his Wehrmacht contacts , had his workers stay at the factory overnight to prevent them coming to any harm . Schindler witnessed the liquidation of the ghetto and was appalled . From that point forward , says <unk> Sol <unk> , Schindler " changed his mind about the Nazis . He decided to get out and to save as many Jews as he could . " 
 Płaszów concentration camp opened in March 1943 on the former site of two Jewish cemeteries on <unk> Street , about 2 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 6 mi ) from the DEF factory . In charge of the camp was SS @-@ Hauptsturmführer Amon Göth , a brutal sadist who would shoot inmates of the camp at random . Inmates at Płaszów lived in constant daily fear for their lives . Emilie Schindler called Göth " the most despicable man I have ever met . " 
 Initially Göth 's plan was that all the factories , including Schindler 's , should be moved inside the camp gates . However , Schindler , with a combination of diplomacy , flattery , and bribery , not only prevented his factory from being moved , but convinced Göth to allow him to build ( at his own expense ) a subcamp at Emalia to house his workers plus 450 Jews from other nearby factories . There they were safe from the threat of random execution , were well fed and housed , and were even permitted to undertake religious observances . 
 Schindler was arrested twice on suspicion of black market activities and once for breaking the Nuremberg Laws by kissing a Jewish girl , an action forbidden by the Race and Resettlement Act . The first arrest , in late 1941 , led to him being kept overnight . His secretary arranged for his release through Schindler 's influential contacts in the Nazi Party . His second arrest , on 29 April 1942 , was the result of his kissing a Jewish girl on the cheek at his birthday party at the factory the previous day . He remained in jail five days before his influential Nazi contacts were able to obtain his release . The third arrest , where he was accused of black <unk> and bribing Göth and others to improve the conditions of the Jewish workers , took place in October 1944 . He was held for most of a week and released . Göth had been arrested on 13 September 1944 for corruption and other abuses of power , and Schindler 's arrest was part of the ongoing investigation into Göth 's activities . Göth was never convicted on those charges , but was hanged by the Supreme National Tribunal of Poland for war crimes on 13 September 1946 . 
 In 1943 , Schindler was contacted via members of the Jewish resistance movement by Zionist leaders in Budapest . Schindler travelled there several times to report in person on Nazi mistreatment of the Jews . He brought back funding provided by the Jewish Agency for Israel and turned it over to the Jewish underground . 
 = = = Brünnlitz = = = 
 As the Red Army drew nearer in July 1944 , the SS began closing down the easternmost concentration camps and evacuating the remaining prisoners westward to Auschwitz and Gross @-@ Rosen concentration camp . Göth 's personal secretary , Mietek Pemper , alerted Schindler to the Nazis ' plans to close all factories not directly involved in the war effort , including Schindler 's enamelware facility . Pemper suggested to Schindler that production should be switched from cookware to anti @-@ tank grenades in an effort to save the lives of the Jewish workers . Using bribery and his powers of persuasion , Schindler convinced Göth and the officials in Berlin to allow him to move his factory and his workers to Brünnlitz ( Czech : <unk> ) , in the Sudetenland , thus sparing them from certain death in the gas chambers . Using names provided by Jewish Ghetto Police officer Marcel Goldberg , Pemper compiled and typed the list of 1 @,@ 200 Jews — 1 @,@ 000 of Schindler 's workers and 200 inmates from Julius <unk> 's textiles factory — who were sent to Brünnlitz in October 1944 . 
 On 15 October 1944 a train carrying 700 men on Schindler 's list was initially sent to the concentration camp at Gross @-@ Rosen , where the men spent about a week before being re @-@ routed to the factory in Brünnlitz . Three hundred female Schindlerjuden were similarly sent to Auschwitz , where they were in imminent danger of being sent to the gas chambers . Schindler 's usual connections and bribes failed to obtain their release . Finally after he sent his secretary , Hilde Albrecht , with bribes of black market goods , food and diamonds , the women were sent to Brünnlitz after several harrowing weeks in Auschwitz . 
 In addition to workers , Schindler moved 250 wagon loads of machinery and raw materials to the new factory . Few if any useful artillery shells were produced at the plant . When officials from the Armaments Ministry questioned the factory 's low output , Schindler bought finished goods on the black market and resold them as his own . The rations provided by the SS were insufficient to meet the needs of the workers , so Schindler spent most of his time in Kraków , obtaining food , armaments , and other materials . His wife Emilie remained in Brünnlitz , surreptitiously obtaining additional rations and caring for the workers ' health and other basic needs . Schindler also arranged for the transfer of as many as 3 @,@ 000 Jewish women out of Auschwitz to small textiles plants in the Sudetenland in an effort to increase their chances of surviving the war . 
 In January 1945 a trainload of 250 Jews who had been rejected as workers at a mine in <unk> in Poland arrived at Brünnlitz . The boxcars were frozen shut when they arrived , and Emilie Schindler waited while an engineer from the factory opened the cars using a soldering iron . Twelve people were dead in the cars , and the remainder were too ill and feeble to work . Emilie took the survivors into the factory and cared for them in a makeshift hospital until the end of the war . Schindler continued to bribe SS officials to prevent the slaughter of his workers as the Red Army approached . On 7 May 1945 he and his workers gathered on the factory floor to listen to British Prime Minister Winston Churchill announce over the radio that Germany had surrendered , and the war in Europe was over . 
 = = After the war = = 
 As a member of the Nazi Party and the Abwehr intelligence service , Schindler was in danger of being arrested as a war criminal . Bankier , Stern , and several others prepared a statement he could present to the Americans attesting to his role in saving Jewish lives . He was also given a ring , made using gold from dental work taken out of the mouth of <unk> Simon <unk> . The ring was inscribed " Whoever saves one life saves the world entire . " To escape being captured by the Russians , Schindler and his wife departed westward in their vehicle , a two @-@ seater <unk> , initially with several fleeing German soldiers riding on the running boards . A truck containing Schindler 's mistress Marta , several Jewish workers , and a load of black market trade goods followed behind . The <unk> was confiscated by Russian troops at the town of <unk> , which had already been captured by Russian troops . The Schindlers were unable to recover a diamond that Oskar had hidden under the seat . They continued by train and on foot until they reached the American lines at the town of Lenora , and then travelled to Passau , where an American Jewish officer arranged for them to travel to Switzerland by train . They moved to Bavaria in Germany in the fall of 1945 . 
 By the end of the war , Schindler had spent his entire fortune on bribes and black @-@ market purchases of supplies for his workers . Virtually destitute , he moved briefly to Regensburg and later Munich , but did not prosper in postwar Germany . In fact , he was reduced to receiving assistance from Jewish organisations . In 1948 he presented a claim for reimbursement of his wartime expenses to the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee , and received $ 15 @,@ 000 . He estimated his expenditures at over $ 1 @,@ 056 @,@ 000 , including the costs of camp construction , bribes , and expenditures for black market goods , including food . Schindler emigrated to Argentina in 1949 , where he tried raising chickens and then nutria , a small animal raised for its fur . When the business went bankrupt in 1958 , he left his wife and returned to Germany , where he had a series of unsuccessful business ventures , including a cement factory . He declared bankruptcy in 1963 and suffered a heart attack the next year , which led to a month @-@ long stay in hospital . Remaining in contact with many of the Jews he had met during the war , including Stern and Pfefferberg , Schindler survived on donations sent by Schindlerjuden from all over the world . He died on 9 October 1974 and is buried in Jerusalem on Mount Zion , the only member of the Nazi Party to be honoured in this way . For his work during the war , in 1963 Schindler was named Righteous Among the Nations , an award bestowed by the State of Israel on non @-@ Jews who took an active role to rescue Jews during the Holocaust . Other awards include the German Order of Merit ( 1966 ) . 
 Writer Herbert <unk> , who interviewed him in 1948 , wrote that " Schindler 's exceptional deeds stemmed from just that elementary sense of decency and humanity that our sophisticated age seldom sincerely believes in . A repentant opportunist saw the light and rebelled against the sadism and vile criminality all around him . " In a 1983 television documentary , Schindler was quoted as saying , " I felt that the Jews were being destroyed . I had to help them ; there was no choice . "

 In 1951 , Poldek Pfefferberg approached director Fritz Lang and asked him to consider making a film about Schindler . Also on Pfefferberg 's initiative , in 1964 Schindler received a $ 20 @,@ 000 advance from MGM for a proposed film treatment titled To the Last Hour . Neither film was ever made , and Schindler quickly spent the money he received from MGM . He was also approached in the 1960s by MCA of Germany and Walt Disney Productions in Vienna , but again nothing came of these projects . 
 In 1980 , Australian author Thomas Keneally by chance visited Pfefferberg 's luggage store in Beverly Hills while en route home from a film festival in Europe . Pfefferberg took the opportunity to tell Keneally the story of Oskar Schindler . He gave him copies of some materials he had on file , and Keneally soon decided to make a fictionalised treatment of the story . After extensive research and interviews with surviving Schindlerjuden , his 1982 historical novel Schindler 's Ark ( published in the United States as Schindler 's List ) was the result . 
 The novel was adapted into the 1993 movie Schindler 's List by Steven Spielberg . After acquiring the rights in 1983 , Spielberg felt he was not ready emotionally or professionally to tackle the project , and he offered the rights to several other directors . After he read a script for the project prepared by Steven Zaillian for Martin Scorsese , he decided to trade him Cape Fear for the opportunity to do the Schindler biography . In the film , the character of Itzhak Stern ( played by Ben Kingsley ) is a composite of Stern , Bankier , and Pemper . Liam Neeson was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actor for his portrayal of Schindler in the film , which won seven Oscars , including Best Picture . 
 Other film treatments include a 1983 British television documentary produced by Jon Blair for Thames Television entitled Schindler : His Story as Told by the Actual People He Saved ( released in the US in 1994 as Schindler : The Real Story ) , and a 1998 A & E Biography special , Oskar Schindler : The Man Behind the List .

Schindler had stayed with the couple for a few days shortly before his death . <unk> 's son Chris took the suitcase to Stuttgart , where the documents were examined in detail in 1999 by Dr. Wolfgang <unk> , science editor of the Stuttgarter Zeitung . <unk> wrote a series of seven articles , which appeared in the paper from 16 to 26 October 1999 and were eventually published in book form as Schindlers <unk> : Berichte aus dem Leben eines <unk> ; eine <unk> der Stuttgarter Zeitung ( Schindler 's Suitcase : Report on the Life of a Rescuer ) . The documents and suitcase were sent to the Holocaust museum at Yad Vashem in Israel for safekeeping in December 1999 .

The document was given to Keneally in 1980 by Pfefferberg when he was persuading him to write Schindler 's story .

 = = Gameplay = = 
 Bastion is an action role @-@ playing game with a level structure . The player character , " the Kid " , moves through floating , fantasy @-@ themed environments that form paths as the player approaches the edge . Levels consist of a single plane , and are viewed isometrically . They are filled with enemies of various types , which attempt to harm the Kid . The Kid carries two weapons , which may be selected from the choices available to the player at specific locations called arsenals . The Kid also has the ability to perform a special attack . Weapons and special attacks must be acquired before they can be used . There are a limited number of special attacks that the player can perform at any time , represented by " black tonics " that can be found in the levels or dropped from enemies . Special attacks may be used a total of three times . This maximum number of uses can be increased in the Distillery . The Kid 's health is represented by a health bar , which can be replenished with " health tonics " . Like black tonics , the Kid can only carry a certain number of health potions at a time , and can replenish them by finding more in the levels . 
 Levels contain many different environment types , including cities , forests , and bogs . At the end of most levels , the player collects an item called a core or a shard ; occasionally , the level begins to disintegrate once the Kid takes the item , forcing him to hastily retreat . As the player progresses through the levels , a voice narrates their actions . This narration gives scripted plot information as well as dynamic comments , such as on the player 's skill with a weapon or performance while fighting enemies . 
 Between levels , the Kid visits the Bastion , where the player can use fragments — the game 's form of currency — that they have accrued to buy materials and upgrade weapons . With each core the player collects , they can add one of six structures to the Bastion , such as a shrine , an armory , or a distillery , and each shard allows the player to expand a structure . Each structure serves a different purpose ; for example , the distillery lets the player select upgrades , and the shrine allows the player to choose idols of the gods to invoke , causing the enemies to become stronger and giving the player increased experience points and currency . Experience points are used to determine the Kid 's ability level ; higher values give the player more health and increase the number of upgrades they can select . 
 Whenever the player leaves the Bastion , they can choose between one or two regular levels to play . In addition to these levels , however , the Kid can engage in challenge courses designed to test the player 's skills with the weapons the player has found . They are called Proving Grounds . The challenges differ depending on the weapon , such as destroying a certain number of objects within a given time or breaking targets in the fewest shots possible . According to the player 's score , different tiers of prizes are awarded . Additionally , the Kid can fight waves of enemies while the narrator tells a character 's backstory by journeying to " Who Knows Where " from the Bastion . The back story battles occur during ' Memories . ' The player earns fragments and experience for each completed wave . After the game is completed , the player can choose to begin a " new game + " mode , where the player replays through the game while keeping the experience points , fragments , and weapons that they have gained . This mode also offers more options in the buildings , as well as two more journeys to " Who Knows Where " . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The game takes place in the aftermath of the Calamity , a catastrophic event that suddenly fractured the city of Caelondia ( / <unk> / ) as well as the surrounding areas of the game 's world into many floating pieces , disrupting its ecology and reducing most of its people to ash . Players take control of the Kid , a silent protagonist who awakens on one of the few remaining pieces of the old world and sets off for the eponymous Bastion , where everyone was supposed to go in troubled times . The only survivor he meets there is an elderly man named Rucks , the game 's narrator , who instructs him to collect the Cores that once powered Caelondia . A device in the Bastion can use the power of the crystalline Cores to create landmasses and structures , as well as enable the Kid to travel farther afield via " skyways " that propel him through the air . 
 During his quest , the Kid meets two more survivors : Zulf , an ambassador from the Ura , underground @-@ dwelling people with whom Caelondia was once at war ; and Zia , an Ura girl who was raised in Caelondia . Both of them return to the Bastion , but upon reading a journal that the Kid discovers , Zulf intentionally damages parts of the Bastion 's central device ( the monument ) and returns to Ura territory . The Kid learns that the journal belonged to Zia 's father , Venn , who had worked for the <unk> . He had helped <unk> scientists ( " <unk> " ) build a weapon intended to destroy the Ura completely to prevent another war . Venn rigged the weapon to backfire , so that when he was finally forced to trigger it , the resulting Calamity destroyed most of Caelondia as well . 
 To repair Zulf 's damage to the Bastion , the Kid starts collecting Shards , a lesser form of Cores . As he obtains the penultimate shard needed , the Ura attack the Bastion , damaging it and abducting Zia . In the next seven days , The Kid engages in sporadic skirmishes in Ura territory . When he finally blasts through an Ura outpost and meets Zia , she tells him that she had left with the Ura voluntarily to find out their intentions ; Rucks had previously told Zia that the Bastion had the ability to somehow fix the Calamity . The Kid travels to the once @-@ underground Ura homeland to retrieve the last shard . There , he discovers Zulf being attacked by his own people : the battle with the Kid has devastated the Ura forces , and they blame Zulf for bringing the Kid to their home . The Kid can choose to drop his weapon to help Zulf or leave him . If he leaves Zulf behind , the Kid destroys the remnants of the Ura and escapes through a skyway . If he chooses to carry Zulf , Ura archers initially open fire on them but ultimately cease fire and watch silently as the Kid and Zulf take the skyway back to the Bastion . 
 After the Kid returns and recovers , Rucks gives him another choice : He can have the Bastion rewind time to before the Calamity in the hopes of preventing it , or use it to evacuate the survivors and move on to somewhere safe . Rucks is unsure if there is any way to prevent the Calamity from reoccurring if the time is rewound , as there was no way to test the process . The game ends either way , showing images of the characters ( with the inclusion of Zulf if the player chose to rescue him ) flying away or of their lives before the Calamity along with the credits . In the New Game + mode , which is unlocked after beating the game once , it is hinted that restoring the world didn 't prevent the Calamity . 
 = = Development = = 
 Bastion was created by a team of seven people , who composed the studio Supergiant Games . It was the company 's first game . The game was directed by Amir Rao and Greg Kasavin wrote the game 's narration , which was spoken by Logan Cunningham . Jen Zee was the artist , Gavin Simon developed the gameplay , Andrew Wang helped develop the game , and Darren Korb handled the sound effects and music . The co @-@ founders of Supergiant Games , Rao and Simon , previously worked for Electronic Arts , where they helped develop Command & Conquer 3 and Red Alert 3 . They left to form the studio because they wanted the development speed and the ability to try new ideas that would be possible with a smaller team . Development began on the game in September 2009 . The team created the game over almost two years , and funded the development themselves . Most of the team built the game in a house in San Jose , though the music and voice acting were recorded in New York City . Some of the San Jose designers — including the writer — did not meet Rucks ' voice actor in person until near the release of the game . The team spent the first nine months of development prototyping various ideas , before settling on the game 's design . 
 The original idea was based around the premise of creating a town like those found in a role @-@ playing game . The team chose the design elements of a fractured , floating world due to their wish to portray a sky in the game , which is usually not possible with an isometric camera , as it always points down . They also wanted to forgo a map system , and felt that having the ground come up to the Kid allowed the player to easily see without a map where they had already been in a level . The story of the Calamity was created as a way to explain this game mechanic . Jen Zee developed the art style of the game to express beauty in a post @-@ apocalyptic landscape . The hand @-@ painted style was intended to soften the sharpness she saw as typical in isometric games and the colorless , harsh depictions of most devastated landscapes . Zee was inspired by the pixel art landscapes of earlier Japanese isometric games . 
 The narrator was added early in the game 's development as a way to provide background details and depth to the world without requiring the player to read long strings of text or wait through cutscenes . To avoid slowing the pace of the action @-@ oriented gameplay , the team had the narrator mainly speak in short , evocative phrases , with long pauses between speaking parts . The narrator is intended to feel like an " old acquaintance " to the player , a connection built by his commentary on the player 's actions as they happen , both major and minor . Kasavin sought to make the game feel as if it were the player 's story , rather than just a story being watched . The development of Bastion was chronicled in the monthly Building the Bastion video series from October 2010 to May 2011 in which Supergiant Games collaborated with Kasavin 's former GameSpot co @-@ workers at Giant Bomb . The videos showed early game concepts in addition to the process of building the final game , as well as interviews with the team . 
 Supergiant Games showed an early , unplayable version of the game at the March 2010 Game Developers Conference , to little acclaim . They debuted a playable version of the game at the September 2010 Penny Arcade Expo , where it was well received . After a strong showing at the March 2011 Game Developers Conference , Warner Bros. Interactive Entertainment signed on to publish and distribute the game . The team decided to partner with a publisher in order to get through the process of Xbox Live certification . Bastion was released on July 20 , 2011 for Xbox Live Arcade ( XBLA ) , and on August 16 , 2011 for digital distribution on Windows through Steam . It was released as a browser game for Google Chrome on December 9 , 2011 . A version for Mac OS X was made available via the Mac App Store on April 26 , 2012 along with a SteamPlay update for Mac OS X and Windows . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Bastion 's soundtrack was produced and composed by Darren Korb , a songwriter and composer . He was selected to pen the soundtrack by Rao , who was a childhood friend of Korb . Bastion was the first video game that Korb had scored ; prior to it he had worked on a few smaller television shows and movies . He was brought onto the team in the beginning stages of the project , and several of the pieces he developed were created prior to the final design of the levels with which they were associated . The musical style of the soundtrack has been described by Korb as " acoustic frontier trip hop " . It was intended to evoke both the American frontier and an exotic fantasy world . The songs combine " heavily sampled beats in layers , along with acoustic elements " , and he determined that he wanted to create the soundtrack in that style as it was different from video game soundtracks that he had heard before . The music was recorded in Korb 's closet at his New York City apartment , as were the sound effects and more than three thousand lines of narration by Cunningham . 
 In addition to composing the music , Korb wrote all the lyrics for the soundtrack . The soundtrack features four vocal themes : " Build That Wall " , " What 's Left Undone " , " Mother , I 'm Here " , and " Setting Sail , Coming Home " . " Build That Wall " features the voice of Ashley Lynn Barrett , " What 's Left Undone " features that of Cunningham and " Mother , I 'm Here " features Korb , and both Korb and Barrett perform in " Setting Sail , Coming Home " . Supergiant Games originally had not planned to release a full soundtrack album for the game , but due to fan demand they released one in digital format on August 5 , 2011 , with two songs not heard in the game . These songs are " Get Used to It " , which has a voiceover written by Greg Kasavin and spoken by Logan Cunningham , and " The Pantheon ( Ain 't Gonna Catch You ) " , with lyrics written by Korb and sung by Cunningham . A physical limited edition CD signed by Korb was released on September 2 . The soundtrack sold 30 @,@ 000 copies by November 2011 . On March 15 , 2012 , Supergiant Games released sheet music for piano and guitar arrangements by Korb of " Build That Wall " , " Mother , I 'm Here " , " Setting Sail , Coming Home " , and " The Pantheon ( Ain 't Gonna Catch You ) " for free in their online store .

 Bastion was released to strong sales and critical acclaim . The game sold more than 500 @,@ 000 copies during 2011 , 200 @,@ 000 of which were for the Xbox Live Arcade . In March 2013 at the PAX East gaming convention , Bastion 's creative director Greg Kasavin stated that the game had sold more than 1 @.@ 7 million copies combined across all platforms . By May 2014 , the game had sold over 2 million copies , and by January 2015 , it had sold over 3 million . Bob Mackey of 1UP.com called it " the perfect mesh of game and story " , and McKinley Noble of GamePro said that it " raises the visual and narrative bar for downloadable titles " . Maxwell McGee of GameSpot called it " wonderfully crafted " and " an amazingly good time " , and Greg Miller of IGN concluded that Bastion " is amazing and you owe it to yourself to download it " . 
 The presentation of the game was widely praised , especially the narration . Mackey said that the game " could be sold on its presentation alone " , focusing on the graphics , music , and story . Edge said that the narration added " emotional resonance " to the game , and Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer praised the " dazzling visuals " and " artful commentary " . Game Informer 's Matt Miller highlighted " the well @-@ written narration , excellent music , and bright visuals " as factors that made the game feel " like a storybook in which you control the outcome . " Of the presentation elements , the story was the least praised , though several reviewers such as Noble enjoyed it , saying that it " just gets better the further you delve into it . " Ryan Scott of GameSpy , however , termed it a " just @-@ sorta @-@ there plot " , and Greg Miller said that it " could have been better " and never " hooked " him . 
 Reviewers had a more mixed opinion of the gameplay . Mackey praised the variety of gameplay elements and said that combat has " a deceptive amount of depth " , but Bramwell felt that the combat did not " invite experimentation " and was somewhat disappointing . Edge said that the gameplay was " more interested in variety than challenge " , for which he praised it , and Matt Miller said that combat was " a lot of fun " , though he felt it lacked " the depth , speed , or complexity of a true action game " . Greg Miller highlighted the variety of the gameplay as the best part of the game , and Scott called it " enjoyable " , though not " challenging " .

 = Tasha Yar = 
 Natasha " Tasha " Yar is a fictional character that mainly appeared in the first season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek : The Next Generation . Portrayed by Denise Crosby , she is chief of security aboard the Starfleet starship USS Enterprise @-@ D and carries the rank of lieutenant . The character 's concept was originally based upon the character of Vasquez from the 1986 film Aliens . Following further development she became known first as Tanya , and then Tasha . Crosby had originally auditioned for the role of Deanna Troi , while Rosalind Chao became a favorite for Tasha . After Marina Sirtis auditioned for the role , the show 's creator Gene Roddenberry decided to switch the roles for the actresses , with Sirtis becoming Troi and Crosby becoming Yar ( Chao would later appear on the series in a recurring role as Keiko O 'Brien ) . 
 The character first appeared in the series ' pilot episode , " Encounter at Farpoint " . After Crosby decided to leave the show , Yar was killed by the creature Armus in " Skin of Evil " , the 23rd episode of the season . She was written back into the show for a guest appearance in the third season episode " Yesterday 's Enterprise " , in which the timeline was altered so that she did not die , and again in the final episode of the series " All Good Things ... " , in events set prior to the pilot . 
 She was described as a forerunner to other strong women in science fiction , such as Kara Thrace from the 2004 version of Battlestar Galactica , while providing a step between the appearances of female characters in The Original Series to the command positions they have in Star Trek : Deep Space Nine and Voyager . Questions were raised over the sexuality of the character , and it was thought that the events in the episode " The Naked Now " were designed to establish her heterosexuality . The manner of her first death was received with mostly negative reviews . One critic called it typical of the death of a Star Trek security officer , and the scene was also included in a list of " naff " sci @-@ fi deaths . 
 = = Concept and development = = 
 Inspired by Vasquez in Aliens , the character was initially named " Macha Hernandez " and was the tactical officer of the Enterprise . This had been changed by the first casting call — issued on December 10 , 1986 — when she was given the position of security chief . The producers considered Jenette Goldstein , who had played Vasquez , for the role , but writer Dorothy Fontana pointed out that the actress " is not Latina . She is petite , blue @-@ eyed , freckle @-@ faced " . The character was subsequently renamed " Tanya " around March 13 . 
 By the time that the writers ' and directors ' guide for the series was published , dated March 23 , 1987 , the character was named Natasha " Tasha " Yar . Her surname was suggested by Robert Lewin , drawing inspiration from the Babi Yar atrocities in Ukraine during the Second World War . Her biography stated that she was 28 years old , and confirmed her Ukrainian descent . She was planned to have a friendship with teenager Wesley Crusher , and was described in the guide as " treat [ ing ] this boy like the most wonderful person imaginable . Wes is the childhood friend that Tasha never had . " In April 1987 , Lianne Langland , Julia Nickson , Rosalind Chao , Leah Ayres and Bunty Bailey were each listed as being in contention for the role . Chao was a favorite candidate , while Denise Crosby was described as " the only possibility " for the character of Troi . The production staff were not keen on having two actresses in the bridge crew roles with similar physical types and hair colors , and so the team took account of the casting of the two parts together . The writers and directors guide described Yar as having a muscular but very feminine body type , and being sufficiently athletic to defeat most other crew members in martial arts . After Crosby and Marina Sirtis had each auditioned for Troi and Yar respectively , Gene Roddenberry decided to switch the actresses and cast Crosby as Tasha Yar . He felt that Sirtis ' appearance was better suited to the " exotic " Troi . 
 Before the end of the first season , Crosby asked to be released from her contract as she was unhappy that her character was not being developed . She later said " I was miserable . I couldn 't wait to get off that show . I was dying . " Roddenberry agreed to her request , and she left on good terms . The final episode she filmed was " Symbiosis " , which was completed after Yar 's death in " Skin of Evil " . Her last scene was during the final act of the episode , in which she can be seen waving goodbye to the camera as the cargo bay doors close . After her departure , archive footage of Crosby as Yar was used in the episodes " The Schizoid Man " and " Shades of Gray " . 
 Crosby was happy to return in " Yesterday 's Enterprise " due to the strength of the script , saying that " I had more to do in that episode than I 'd ever had to do before . " Prior to the episode being aired , the media had to be reassured that Yar was not returning in a dream sequence . Following her appearance in that episode , Crosby pitched the idea of Yar 's daughter , Sela , to the producers . She made her first appearance in this role in the two @-@ part " Redemption " , and appeared once more in another two @-@ part episode , " Unification " . 
 Denise Crosby returned twice more in the non @-@ canon Star Trek universe . In 2007 , she appeared as an ancestor of Tasha Yar , Jenna Yar , in " Blood and Fire " , an episode of the fan @-@ produced series Star Trek : New Voyages . Tasha Yar was written into Star Trek Online as part of the three @-@ year anniversary celebration in 2013 . Denise Crosby recorded audio for the game , in scenes set after those in " Yesterday 's Enterprise " . 
 = = Appearances = = 
 Natasha Yar 's origins are explained in the season four episode " Legacy " . She was born on the planet Turkana IV in 2337 . She had a younger sister named Ishara ( Beth Toussaint ) , who was born five years after her . Shortly after Ishara 's birth , the girls ' parents were killed and they were taken in by other people . However , they were subsequently abandoned and Tasha was required to look after her sister on her own . The government on the planet had collapsed , and the sisters were forced to scavenge for food while avoiding rape gangs . In <unk> , aged 15 , Tasha managed to leave Turkana IV . She never saw Ishara again ; the latter joined the " Coalition " , one of the factions on the planet before Tasha left . Tasha refused to join the cadres on the planet , blaming them for her parent 's deaths . 
 Yar appeared for the first time in the pilot episode of Star Trek : The Next Generation as the Security and Tactical Officer on board the USS Enterprise @-@ D. When Captain Picard ( Patrick Stewart ) orders an emergency saucer separation , Yar is one of the bridge crew to accompany him to the battle bridge . She is amongst the crew abducted by Q ( John de Lancie ) , and later serves on the away team to Farpoint Station . In " The Naked Now " , while the crew are under the influence of an alien ailment , she initiates a sexual encounter with the android Data ( Brent Spiner ) . In " Code of Honor " Yar is abducted by Lutan ( Jessie Lawrence Ferguson ) , the leader of the planet Ligon II , after she demonstrates her combat skills on the holodeck . She defeats Lutan 's wife Yareena in ritual combat . Yareena is revived on the Enterprise by Doctor Crusher ( Gates McFadden ) . During the events of " Where No One Has Gone Before " , Yar begins to hallucinate that she is back on Turkana IV and running for her life . In " The Arsenal of Freedom " , Yar and Data are trapped together on the surface of the planet Minos and are attacked by a series of sentry probes which adapt to Data and Yar 's phasers . The situation is resolved by Captain Picard , who is trapped elsewhere on the planet 's surface with Dr. Crusher . 
 Yar forms part of the away team which beams down to Vagra II to rescue Deanna Troi ( Marina Sirtis ) from a crashed shuttlecraft in " Skin of Evil " . She is killed by the creature Armus ( Mart McChesney and Ron Gans ) in a display of his power . The crew hold a memorial service for her on the holodeck , and Worf ( Michael Dorn ) replaces her as chief tactical and security officer . After her death it is revealed that Data keeps a small hologram of her in his quarters . Despite Data 's lack of emotions , he is described by reviewers as being <unk> attached to her image . During the court hearing on Data 's stature as a sentient being in " The Measure of a Man " , he explains that he and Yar were intimate and that she was special to him . 
 After the USS Enterprise @-@ C emerges from a rift in space @-@ time in " Yesterday 's Enterprise " , the timeline is changed and Yar is once again alive and in her former position on the Enterprise @-@ D. She works with the older Enterprise 's helmsman , Richard Castillo ( Christopher McDonald ) , and the two become close . Guinan ( Whoopi Goldberg ) , who has some awareness of the timeline that would be restored by the Enterprise @-@ C returning into the rift , confides in Yar that she believes that Yar died <unk> in that timeline . Based on that advice , Yar transfers to the Enterprise @-@ C and returns with it to two decades into the past , and its expected destruction at the hands of the Romulans while defending the Klingon outpost Narendra III . The alternative universe version of Yar travelled back in time on board the Enterprise @-@ C , and into the main timeline . This process was later described as " world jumping " rather than a typical timeline travel story by critics . 
 Yar 's half @-@ Romulan daughter Sela explains in " Redemption " that several members of the Enterprise @-@ C crew were captured by the Romulans when it returned through the rift , including Yar . A Romulan general offered to spare the crew 's lives if she became his consort . After a year , Yar gave birth to Sela . When Sela was four , Yar attempted to escape but Sela screamed to prevent her from being taken away from her father . After she was caught , Yar was executed . 
 The series finale " All Good Things ... " includes Yar 's final appearance , in scenes which take place prior to and in the early parts of " Encounter at Farpoint " . As most of the bridge crew are yet to join the Enterprise @-@ D in the scenes , Yar is one of the senior members of the crew under Captain Picard in the earliest of the three timeframes in the episode . She needs to be convinced by Picard to put the ship in danger in order to destroy the temporal anomaly that threatens to prevent life from evolving on Earth . 
 = = Reception and commentary = = 
 Science fiction writer Keith DeCandido considered Yar the most interesting role to appear in the " writer 's bible " , while Hal Boedeker characterized her as " forceful " in an article on women in Star Trek for Knight Ridder . A Den of Geek article also about women in Star Trek described the character as a predecessor to Kara " Starbuck " Thrace in the 2004 re @-@ imagining of Battlestar Galactica . A Post @-@ Tribune review of the series following the pilot described Yar as a " tough cookie " and the reviewer 's favorite crew member . Frank <unk> , in his article on Deep Space Nine 's Kira Nerys , outlined the progression of female roles in " gender assumptions " from The Original Series where women were on the bridge , through Tasha Yar in The Next Generation where they were in command positions , to Deep Space Nine and Voyager where women were in lead parts . He noted specifically that women appeared in command positions more regularly as main and supporting characters , and were portrayed as more assertive and combative , with leading roles in action sequences . 
 In Sarah <unk> 's contribution on rape in Star Trek to the book Enterprise Zones : Critical Positions on Star Trek , she extrapolates that Yar 's introduction to Starfleet was similar to the actions of United States Army soldiers issuing supplies to the survivors of the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki and the liberation of Nazi concentration camps during the Second World War . The idea of an American savior of colonial rape victims stems from U.S. propaganda during the war , stating that " In TNG , the Federation citizen represents a new and improved version of this U.S. savior citizen ; the Federation citizen is a post @-@ nationalist , post @-@ sexist , and post @-@ racist soldier — feminist " . 
 Reviewers have questioned the character 's sexuality since the end of the series . Curve magazine speculated that Yar was a " closeted " lesbian . In the book Science Fiction Audiences : Watching Doctor Who and Star Trek , the authors describe her as " an obvious bisexual " , but that " she should be a lesbian " . Referring to the events in " The Naked Now " , the authors explain " when they decided to straighten her , they used an android . So we ended up <unk> two perfectly wonderful characters " . The authors of the book Deep Space and Sacred Time : Star Trek in the American Mythos also thought that having Data and Yar consummate sexually was a means to state early on in the series the heterosexuality of the two most androgynous characters in the show . 
 Fans responded negatively to the departure of Yar as they felt that the character had potential for future expansion . Reviewers were also critical of the manner of Yar 's death . Keith DeCandido called it " pointless " , but thought that it was no worse than the deaths of other security officer " <unk> " throughout the history of Star Trek . He said that he preferred her death in " Skin of Evil " to the " clichéd @-@ up @-@ the @-@ <unk> " death she experienced in " Yesterday 's Enterprise " . Gary Westfahl , in his book Space and Beyond : The Frontier Theme in Science Fiction , described Yar 's death as one of the most notable ones in Star Trek , alongside that of Spock in Star Trek II : The Wrath of Khan and James T. Kirk in Star Trek Generations . SFX magazine included her first death in a 2012 list of the top 21 " Naff Sci @-@ Fi Deaths " , while the Chicago Sun @-@ Times described her death in " Yesterday 's Enterprise " as a " hero 's death " . 
 = Kauhajoki school shooting = 
 The Kauhajoki school shooting occurred on 23 September 2008 , at the Seinäjoki University of Applied Sciences in Western Finland . The gunman , 22 @-@ year @-@ old student Matti Juhani Saari , shot and fatally injured ten people with a Walther P22 semi @-@ automatic pistol , before shooting himself in the head . He died a few hours later in Tampere University Hospital . One woman was injured but was in a stable condition . 
 The shooting took place at the Kauhajoki School of Hospitality , owned by the Seinäjoki Municipal Federation of Education . The facilities and campus were shared between the Seinäjoki University of Applied Sciences and the Seinäjoki Vocational Education Centre – <unk> . Saari was a second @-@ year student in a Bachelor of Hospitality Management degree programme . 
 The incident was the second school shooting in less than a year in Finland , the other being the Jokela school shooting in November 2007 , in which nine people including the gunman died . Before that , only one other school shooting had taken place in the country 's history , in Rauma in 1989 , leaving two people dead . 
 = = Shooting = = 
 Saari entered through the school buildings via the basement . The shooting began at around 10 : 40 ( UTC + 3 ) , when roughly 200 people were assembled inside the college . The emergency services received their first call at 10 : 46 . Saari was armed with a .22 LR calibre Walther P22 Target semi @-@ automatic firearm and homemade Molotov cocktails . He wore dark clothing and a balaclava ( ski mask ) . The school 's caretaker Jukka Forsberg , who had several shots directed at him but survived , said " [ The gunman ] was very well prepared . He walked calmly . " 
 Saari initially opened fire on a group of students taking a business studies exam , and entered at least one other classroom . According to the three students who were able to escape the exam room ( there were roughly 20 students taking the exam ) , Saari had approached his victims individually before shooting them . It was also said that he was revelling in the situation and was acting very aggressively . Saari encountered little resistance , and the massacre was concluded relatively quickly . He then covered the classroom in a flammable liquid , believed to be petrol , and set the room alight . 
 A student in an adjacent classroom , Sanna Orpana , said that her class had heard " shooting and a kind of a rumble like tables falling down . " Orpana believed at the time that the noise may have been coming from a toy gun , and two other students went to investigate the noise . Saari shot at them , and the remaining students in Orpana 's classroom hid under a table before running upstairs . At some point between 10 : 45 – 11 : 00 Saari ran down a corridor and threw a petrol bomb into a language laboratory . He then shot out all of the windows in the school 's main corridor , that extended through the building . It was during this time that he also took aim at Forsberg . 
 A police van with two officers arrived a short time after the shootings began , at around 11 : 00 . They entered the yard of the college where they were shot at by Saari , and forced to retreat . From around 11 : 45 to 12 : 00 further police units , bolstered by a number of armoured vehicles , began to arrive on the scene . They attempted to enter the building through the main corridor , but this assault was aborted due to the black smoke that was emanating from within the building . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Having escaped the buildings in a variety of ways ( including through doors and out of windows ) , some students found themselves impeded by a river that adjoined the school . However , some were able to use rowing boats as a means of escape . Saari started fires at several other locations within the school buildings , and the fire in the exam room damaged some of the bodies so badly that they had to be identified from DNA and dental records . Nine of the victims were found in the exam room , and one in a nearby corridor . It was later ascertained that this student had fled the burning classroom and then died in the corridor . Eight of the victims were female students , one a male student , and one a male member of staff . All of the students killed were in their 20s , and the teacher was in his 50s . A 21 @-@ year @-@ old woman was shot in the head but had two operations in the days after sustaining her injury , and was reported as being in a satisfactory condition . A further ten students were treated for minor injuries including sprains and cuts from broken glass . All the victims were classmates of Saari 's . Saari was originally from <unk> @-@ Pohjanmaa , but lived in Kauhajoki where he was enrolled on his catering course at the college . It was later revealed that the male student was probably a close friend of Saari 's . The pair had spent an evening out together in February 2008 when they were threatened with a starter pistol . A photo of them together had been circulating on the Internet , in which Saari jokingly points at his friend 's head with his forefinger . The names of the other victims were withheld by police . 
 Firefighters extinguished the fires without any major damage to the school . Saari remained at large for some time in the school grounds after they had been evacuated . Two days after the killings , a friend of Saari 's , named <unk> , told 7 <unk> that at 11 : 53 he received a call from Saari in which he confessed to having killed ten people . Saari is claimed to have spoken to <unk> in a calm manner , telling him that he wanted to say goodbye . He was found alive by the police at 12 : 30 , having shot himself in the head . He was taken to Tampere University Hospital , where he was treated for his gunshot wound . He died a short time later at 17 : 40 . 
 With a total of ten people killed , it was the deadliest peacetime attack in Finnish history , surpassing the previous highest count of eight in the Jokela school shooting . It was the deadliest attack on a school campus since April 2007 , when Seung @-@ Hui Cho killed 32 people during the Virginia Tech shooting . Saari had fired a total of nearly 200 shots , including shots into the air . The highest number of shots inflicted to a single victim was twenty .

 Matti Juhani Saari ( 20 May 1986 – 23 September 2008 ) was identified as the gunman responsible for the shooting . Saari , a hospitality management student at the school , was thrown out of the Finnish Army in 2006 , after being a member for only a month for opening fire in a woodland exercise , against orders . Saari had been the victim of bullying in secondary school and dropped out of his classes for this reason . A friend of Saari also reported that he had been seeing a psychologist in the months before the shooting , and had been obsessed with guns . 
 Saari left behind two handwritten notes in his school dormitory indicating that he had been planning the massacre for six years . A police spokesperson commented : " Saari left notes saying he had a hatred for mankind , for the whole of the human race , and that he had been thinking about what he was going to do for years . The notes show he was very troubled and he hated everything . " Police said that although most of the victims were female , the motive did not seem to be a hatred of women . One of Saari 's friends noticed a change in his behaviour two years before the shootings , when Saari began expressing a fondness for guns and an admiration of the school shootings in the United States . He said that around 18 months previously Saari had sent him a message saying that he would carry out a school shooting the next day . Saari reportedly denied being serious about carrying out his threat . 
 Police were also investigating whether a copycat element was involved after it emerged that both Saari and Pekka @-@ Eric <unk> , the gunman in the Jokela school shooting , had bought their guns from the same store . Both gunmen had taken photographs of themselves in similar poses , and both exchanged videos related to school shootings on YouTube and Finnish social networking site IRC @-@ Galleria . In March 2009 , Police ruled out contact with Pekka @-@ Eric <unk> , and said that he had committed his crimes alone : 200 people were interviewed during the investigation , none of whom said they knew of Saari 's plans . 
 Saari had a YouTube account where he uploaded videos of him firing a handgun at a local shooting range . Among the user 's YouTube account favourites was footage of the Columbine High School massacre . Finnish police had been informed about the YouTube videos in an anonymous tip @-@ off on the Friday before the shooting . The police talked to Saari and searched his home on the day before the incident , Monday 22 September . They found no reason to arrest him as he held a temporary weapons permit . In August 2008 , Saari had obtained a licence for a .22 @-@ calibre ( 5 @.@ 6 mm ) pistol . The police said that Saari did not have a criminal record . However , a police inspector was subsequently charged with dereliction of duty , and his court case began in September 2009 . 
 Saari also posted another video on a Finnish social networking site , in which he pointed a gun at the camera and said in English " You will die next " , followed by firing four shots in the direction of the camera . This video was not available to the police when Saari was questioned . A police spokesperson commented : " The only video we saw was where he was shooting at the range . It was only afterwards that much more information came out . " Police said that Saari would have been detained if they had known about this video at the time of the questioning . Police said that they believed Saari 's videos were shot by someone else , and that they were trying to identify who this person was . The Chief Investigator of the case , Jari <unk> , speculated that the cameraman may have been the friend of Saari 's who was murdered . 
 Interior Minister Anne Holmlund announced that the actions of the police would be investigated . Police Commissioner Mikko <unk> said that Finnish police would increase their monitoring of YouTube and other social networking sites , and when asked whether similar attacks could take place in the future , he replied : " I badly fear it 's possible . "

 On the day of the incident , a crisis meeting was held , with government ministers , chairs of the parliamentary groups , and police officials all in attendance . The Prime Minister Matti Vanhanen described it as a " tragic day " and appealed for unity in the hope " that events like these will not happen again . " A national day of mourning was declared for the following day , and Vanhanen travelled to Kauhajoki to meet with students . 
 Within days of the shooting , the police said they had received a sizeable number of tip @-@ offs alerting them to suspicious photographs , videos , and comments on chat rooms . Finnish media reported that several bomb threats and other threatening messages were circulating among students nationwide in the few days after the shootings as well . 
 = SMS Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand = 
 SMS Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand was an Austro @-@ Hungarian Radetzky @-@ class pre @-@ dreadnought battleship commissioned into the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy on 5 June 1910 . She was named after Archduke Franz Ferdinand . The first ship of her class to be built , she preceded Radetzky by more than six months . Her armament included four 30 @.@ 5 cm ( 12 in ) guns in two twin turrets , and eight 24 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) guns in four twin turrets . 
 She participated in an international naval protest of the Balkan Wars in 1913 , during which she helped enforce a blockade of Montenegro . She was also one of the first ships to deploy seaplanes for military use . During World War I , she saw limited service in the 2nd Division of the 1st Battle Squadron , including mobilization to assist the escape of the German ships SMS Goeben and SMS Breslau and the bombardment of Ancona in 1915 . At the end of the war , she was ceded to Italy as a war prize and was eventually scrapped in 1926 . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand was built at the Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino dockyard in Trieste . She was laid down on 12 September 1907 and launched from the slipway on 8 September 1908 . The teak used on her deck was the only material Austria @-@ Hungary purchased abroad to build her . A month and a half after her launch , she was towed to the harbor in Muggia for completion . During a severe storm that night , she broke loose from her moorings ; with no crewmen aboard , Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand drifted for several hours before running aground just off Izola . The following morning , the navy located her and started to refloat her . Completion was delayed by a welders ' strike in 1908 and a <unk> ' strike in 1909 . Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand was the first ship of the class to be completed , and she was commissioned into the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy on 5 June 1910 . 
 At 137 @.@ 5 m ( 451 ft 1 in ) long , with a beam of 24 @.@ 6 m ( 80 ft 9 in ) and a draft of 8 @.@ 1 m ( 26 ft 7 in ) , Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand normally displaced 14 @,@ 508 long tons ( 14 @,@ 741 t ) . With full combat load , she displaced up to 15 @,@ 845 @.@ 5 long tons ( 16 @,@ 100 t ) . Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand , like the other ships of the Radetzky class , was smaller and not as well @-@ armed as other battleships in contemporary navies . Despite these shortcomings , Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand was one of Austria @-@ Hungary 's first true deep @-@ water fighting ships . She was powered by two 4 @-@ cylinder vertical triple expansion steam engines rated at 19 @,@ 800 indicated horsepower and had a maximum speed of 20 @.@ 5 knots ( 38 @.@ 0 km / h ; 23 @.@ 6 mph ) . Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand was the first warship in the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy to use oil and coal @-@ fired boilers . She had a maximum range of 4 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 7 @,@ 408 km ; 4 @,@ 603 mi ) at a cruising speed of 10 kn ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 The ship 's primary armament consisted of four 30 @.@ 5 cm ( 12 in ) 45 @-@ caliber guns in two twin gun turrets . Eight 24 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) guns in four wing turrets formed the heavy secondary battery . The tertiary battery consisted of twenty 10 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) L / 50 guns in casemated single mounts and four 3 @.@ 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) L / 44 guns . Three 45 cm ( 17 @.@ 7 in ) torpedo tubes were also carried , two on the beam and one in the stern . 
 = = Service history = = 
 The ship was assigned to the Austro @-@ Hungarian fleet 's 1st Battle Squadron after her 1910 commissioning . In 1912 , Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand and her two sister ships conducted two training cruises into the eastern Mediterranean Sea . On the second cruise into the Aegean Sea , conducted from November to December , she was accompanied by the cruiser Admiral Spaun and a pair of destroyers . After returning to Pola , the entire fleet mobilized for possible hostilities , as tensions flared in the Balkans . 
 The following year , she participated in an international naval demonstration in the Ionian Sea to protest the Balkan Wars . Ships from other navies included the British pre @-@ dreadnought HMS King Edward VII , the Italian pre @-@ dreadnought Ammiraglio di Saint Bon , the French armoured cruiser Edgar Quinet , and the German light cruiser SMS Breslau . The most important action of the combined flotilla , which was under the command of British Admiral Cecil Burney , was to blockade the Montenegrin coast . The goal of the blockade was to prevent Serbian reinforcements from supporting the siege at Scutari , where Montenegro had besieged a combined force of Albanians and Ottomans . Pressured by the international blockade , Serbia withdrew its army from Scutari , which was subsequently occupied by a joint Allied ground force . 
 The first seaplanes used in combat , supplied by French manufacturer <unk> @-@ <unk> , were operated from Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand and her two sisters during the blockade . However , the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy was not satisfied with the operation , as the ships lacked enough deck space for the planes , as well as a lack of cranes with which they could easily hoist the planes onto the decks . The planes were later moved to a hangar at the navy yard in <unk> . By 1913 , the four new dreadnoughts of the Tegetthoff class — the only dreadnoughts built for the fleet — were coming into active service . With the commissioning of these dreadnoughts , the navy shifted Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand and her sisters to the 2nd Division of the 1st Battle Squadron . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 The ship was named after Archduke Franz Ferdinand , whose assassination on 28 June 1914 triggered World War I. At that time , the battleships in the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy consisted of the Radetzky class , the Tegetthoff class , and the older Habsburg and Erzherzog Karl classes . Along with the remainder of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy , Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand was mobilized in late July 1914 to support the flight of SMS Goeben and Breslau . The two German ships broke out of Messina , which was surrounded by the British navy , and reached their allies in Turkey . The flotilla had advanced as far south as Brindisi in southeastern Italy when news of the successful breakout reached Vienna . The Austro @-@ Hungarian ships were recalled before seeing action . 
 On 23 May 1915 , between two and four hours after the Italian declaration of war reached the main Austro @-@ Hungarian naval base at Pola , Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand and the rest of the fleet departed to bombard the Italian coast . Their focus was on the important naval base at Ancona , and later the coast of Montenegro . The bombardment of Montenegro was part of the larger Austro @-@ Hungarian campaign against the Kingdoms of Montenegro and Serbia , who were members of the Entente , during the first half of 1915 . The attack on Ancona was an immense success , and the ships were unopposed during the operation . The bombardment of the province and the surrounding area resulted in the destruction of an Italian steamer in the port of Ancona itself , and an Italian destroyer , Turbine was severely damaged further south . On the shore , the infrastructure of the port of Ancona , as well as the surrounding towns , were severely damaged . The railroad yard in Ancona , as well as the port facilities in the town , were damaged or destroyed . The local shore batteries were also rendered inactive . Additional targets that were damaged or destroyed included wharves , warehouses , oil tanks , radio stations , and the local barracks . 63 Italians , both civilians and military personnel alike , were killed in the bombardment . By the time Italian ships from Taranto and Brindisi arrived at Ancona , the Austro @-@ Hungarians were safely back in Pola . 
 The objective of the bombardment of Ancona was to delay the Italian Army from deploying its forces along the border with Austria @-@ Hungary by destroying critical transportation systems . The surprise attack on Ancona succeeded in delaying the Italian deployment to the Alps for two weeks . This delay gave Austria @-@ Hungary valuable time to strengthen its Italian border and re @-@ deploy some of its troops from the Eastern and Balkan fronts . 
 The only damage in the ensuing days to Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand appears to have been after the battleships returned to Pola . A collision occurred between the ship and an unknown Austro @-@ Hungarian destroyer on 30 May , while both were attempting to avoid an aerial bombardment from an Italian airship ; the destroyer sank . 
 Aside from the attack on Ancona , the Austro @-@ Hungarian battleships were confined to Pola for the duration of the war . Their operations were limited by Admiral Anton Haus , the commander of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy , who believed that he would need to husband his ships to counter any Italian attempt to seize the Dalmatian coast . Since coal was diverted to the newer Tegetthoff @-@ class battleships , the remainder of the war saw Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand and the rest of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Navy acting as a fleet in being . This resulted in the Allied blockade of the Otranto Strait . With his fleet blockaded in the Adriatic Sea , and with a shortage of coal , Haus enacted a strategy based on mines and submarines designed to reduce the numerical superiority of the Allied navies . 
 = = = Postwar fate = = = 
 According to the terms of the Armistice of Villa Giusti , which ended hostilities between Italy and Austro @-@ Hungary , the latter was to transfer three battleships to Venice . Italy originally intended to seize the three remaining Tegetthoff @-@ class ships , but Italian frogmen sank SMS Viribus Unitis three days before the Armistice took effect . Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand was substituted in her place . The pre @-@ dreadnought served as a showpiece of the Italian victory parade held in March 1919 . She was formally ceded to Italy under the terms of the Treaty of Saint @-@ Germain @-@ en @-@ Laye , signed in September 1919 , and was moved to Venice by sailors of the Regia Marina ( Royal Italian Navy ) . Erzherzog Franz Ferdinand did nothing while in Italian custody ; she was scrapped in 1926 .

 = = Plot = = 
 Princess Victoria of Kent is the heiress presumptive to the throne during the last years of the reign of her uncle King William IV and is subject to a political tug of war for influence over her . On the one side is her mother , the Duchess of Kent , along with the comptroller of the Duchess 's household , Sir John Conroy , who tries to force Victoria to sign papers declaring a regency and giving him and her mother power . 
 On the other side is her uncle , King Leopold I of Belgium , who wishes to use his influence through family ties to secure an alliance between Britain and his kingdom . He decides to have his nephew Prince Albert of Saxe @-@ Coburg @-@ Gotha seduce Victoria and he is coached in her likes and dislikes . The Duchess invites the Coburg brothers , Albert and Prince Ernest of Saxe @-@ Coburg @-@ Gotha , to visit the household . Victoria and Albert develop an early fondness for each other , despite Victoria knowing that Albert was sent by their uncle to win her favours . They begin writing to one another after Albert returns home . 
 At a birthday reception in Windsor Castle , the King states his wish to be closer to Victoria and insults her mother . But when the King increases Victoria 's income , this is rejected by Conroy , who physically subdues her in front of her mother , heightening the animosity between them . The King then sends the Prime Minister Lord Melbourne to advise her . Victoria agrees to make him her private secretary , and he appoints ladies @-@ in @-@ waiting for her from political families allied to him . 
 King William dies after Victoria 's 18th birthday , avoiding a regency . After accession , Victoria immediately begins to exert her independence , including moving into her own room and banishing Conroy from her household and coronation . During her first meeting with the Privy Council , she announces that " I mean to devote my life in service of my country and my people " . Victoria now moves into the recently completed Buckingham Palace and her aunt , Queen Adelaide , advises her against giving in too much to Lord Melbourne 's direction . Albert then comes to England to spend more time with Victoria . They bond more , dancing together during her coronation and later discussing together the condition of the poor . Albert hints at taking their relationship further but the self @-@ sufficient Victoria resists and he leaves . 
 When Lord Melbourne loses a vote in Parliament , the new Prime Minister designate , Sir Robert Peel , wishes to replace some of her ladies @-@ in @-@ waiting with supporters of his own party and the queen refuses . Peel in turn refuses the queen 's invitation to form a new government , allowing Melbourne to continue as Prime Minister . The subsequent crisis damages Victoria 's popularity , leading to demonstrations outside the palace and insults hurled at her in public . Her loneliness during the turbulence draws Victoria closer to Albert through their letters and decides her to invite him back to Britain . Since protocol prevents him suggesting marriage , she proposes to him herself . 
 Their marriage is loving and the birth of their first child helps heal the breach between Victoria and her mother , who had earlier sent a letter of support during the crisis . Nevertheless , Albert is frustrated at his initial powerlessness and Queen Adelaide advises Victoria to allow him to take on more duties . He then reorganises the running of the royal household and dismisses Conroy for mishandling funds . As Victoria 's primary adviser , he now blocks the influences of Lord Melbourne and King Leopold . However , Victoria quarrels with him fiercely for going over her head with Peel in the matter of her household . 
 Soon after , when Victoria is fired upon by a would @-@ be assassin as they are riding in an open carriage , Albert throws himself across her and is wounded . This bravery leads to their reconciliation and Melbourne advises her to share with Albert also her work for the social welfare . 
 The final title card sketches in their successful future until Albert 's death at the age of 42 .

 It was Sarah , Duchess of York , who conceived the idea for a film based upon the early years of Queen Victoria . She had been interested in the queen since her marriage to Prince Andrew , Duke of York , a great @-@ great @-@ great @-@ grandson of Victoria and Albert , and had written two books about her with the help of an historian . The Victoria @-@ Albert relationship in particular drew her into the queen 's history , as she believed there were parallels between their marriage and her own with Prince Andrew , as they both " fought for their love " in the midst of public scrutiny . A friend set up a meeting with producer Graham King , to whom she pitched the idea along with several others . At the time wrapping up his work on The Departed , King , a native of Britain , had been looking for a project set in his home country for years . The producer later remembered , " she pitched me a bunch of things , and among them was a three @-@ page synopsis of Victoria ’ s early life : the precise span covered in The Young Victoria . [ After that the film ] just fell into place . " King brought frequent collaborator Martin Scorsese on board as a co @-@ executive producer , as the Academy Award @-@ winning director knew " pretty much all there is to know about British history " . 
 Gosford Park screenwriter Julian Fellowes contacted King to present ideas for a script , and according to the producer , " [ Fellowes ] seemed to have the whole movie planned out in his head so we told him to go ahead and write it . Three months later , this incredibly impressive screenplay showed up on our desks . " Fellowes was immediately hired by him and Scorsese . Fellowes chose not to end the film at Albert 's death because he wary of copying " the horror of biopics , " where there is simply an important event after important event . Believing it had been done before and that the audience was already familiar with that part of Victoria 's history , he thought it would be better suited for a television series or for another film . 
 For the film 's director , King wanted someone " who would steer us away from the traditional BBC @-@ type costume drama , " and " make a period film for an MTV audience " . By chance , someone recommended King watch the 2005 film <unk> by French @-@ Canadian filmmaker Jean @-@ Marc Vallée , and became immediately interested in hiring him . King offered the job to Vallée on their very first meeting . Though at first expressing disinterest , Vallée agreed to direct after reading the script . He commented , " When I read the script , I saw it 's a family drama , a romance , a political plot at the same time . " Vallee considered Victoria to be a rebel because " she has this attitude , which is you make noise , you want to yell and yell loudly to your parents and all the people , to authority ... ' I 'm going to do it my way . ' That 's what rock ' n ' roll is all about . That 's what I liked about her , this energy . [ Victoria ] was special and had this mystical quality . " 
 Academy Award @-@ winning costume designer Sandy Powell heard about the script and contacted King , who in turn hired her . Powell was granted exclusive access to Victoria 's wedding dress and coronation robes while researching . Based upon his work on The Lives of Others and his German nationality , Hagen <unk> was selected as the director of photography . Fellowes enlisted his friend Alastair Bruce 's help with the coronation ceremony 's historical authenticity , which led to Bruce 's employment as the film 's historical consultant , his first film credit . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 For the title role , King required the candidate be British , and considered casting an unknown actress . British actress Emily Blunt read the script , and aware other actresses would fight for the part , she approached King early in the search process . Blunt later admitted she had a " non @-@ existent knowledge " of the queen , but after consulting her mother about Victoria 's successful marriage , Blunt told King that the queen " was a young girl who was very in love for the first time , and she was in a job where she felt way over her head . So I said to Graham , ' She 's rebellious . She 's a survivor . ' I didn 't want to approach her as the English rose , but as a young girl who was fighting " . They awarded Blunt the role after viewing her entire filmography as well as her Golden Globes acceptance speech for Gideon 's Daughter . Blunt noted , " I thought [ Victoria ] was remarkable and such a challenge . This young girl , who was so feisty and emotional and strong @-@ willed , was very fascinating to me ... In my life and in the job I 've chosen to do , you have to perform all the time . And I thought Victoria was a bit of an actress . " After winning the part , Blunt was allowed access to Windsor Castle , where she viewed Victoria 's paintings , letters , diaries , and music composed by Albert himself . 
 Determined not to use any big Hollywood names , King looked at many European actors before settling on British actor Rupert Friend . They were aware of him from the 2005 film Pride & Prejudice . Vallée noted , " I had an image of Albert in my mind , before we cast Rupert , and how the actor might play him and when Rupert came on board he was just right . He had a very good understanding of the character and he did a lot of research to get him right , with the accent and his deportment . He really looks the part , he looks so romantic ! " Co @-@ producer Dennis O 'Sullivan called Friend " our Scarlett O 'Hara search " . They believed the actor had the most chemistry with Blunt after selecting several to play chess with her . Friend 's height ( 6 ft <unk> ) also played a factor in their choice . Friend believed " Albert was a true unsung hero . A great reformer , a doting husband and father , a hard worker and man of real integrity and modesty . " The actor also thought their relationship was not " a gooey love story " ; rather , their arguments showed it " wasn 't an easy road by any means " . Friend strove to immerse himself in the role , and learned the prince 's particular characteristics , such as the way he rode a horse , walked , and played the piano . He worked with a voice coach and German instructor to perfect his accent , with the intention of " put [ ting ] in as much German as possible , because Victoria and Albert did speak German to each other . " 
 Paul Bettany was cast as Lord Melbourne despite being roughly twenty years too young for the part . Vallée explained , " We couldn 't find a 58 @-@ year @-@ old actor who was sexy and good @-@ looking enough . Paul was a more than good enough actor to age from the inside , and he plays him as a great politician and a great seducer . " Early in the casting process the crew wanted to cast Miranda Richardson as the Duchess of Kent , and believed she had such great chemistry with Blunt that it became " genuinely uncomfortable watching them in a scene , as the scenes are so intense and real . " Jim Broadbent and Mark Strong joined the cast as King William IV and Sir John Conroy , respectively , as did Harriet Walter as Queen Adelaide . Sarah 's elder daughter , Princess Beatrice of York , made her film debut in a small cameo role , becoming the first member of the Royal Family to appear in a non @-@ documentary film . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 In consideration of the expense of a film shot in Britain , King initially sought to film in Germany and Eastern Europe . However , he came to the realisation that it was vital The Young Victoria be filmed in its native country for authenticity . Due to the Duchess of York 's status and connections with the British royal family , The Young Victoria was able to film in many actual palaces and other landmarks . The film had a ten @-@ week shoot starting in August 2007 . Scenes set at Westminster Abbey were filmed at Lincoln Cathedral in September and October , and Ham House was substituted for Kensington Palace . Blenheim Palace , Lancaster House and Ditchley Park doubled for internal scenes of the monarch 's main residence , Buckingham Palace . Other scenes filmed at Hampton Court Palace , Arundel Castle in West Sussex , Wilton House near Salisbury , Balls Park and Belvoir Castle in Leicestershire . Week four of shooting was especially intensive , as filming was done at a different site each day , including Osterley Park , Old Royal Naval College , Ham House , Novello Theatre and Hampton Court . 
 = = Historical accuracy = = 
 Fellowes strove to make the script free of anachronisms , to the point where he became upset when actor Jim Broadbent ad @-@ libbed and told someone to " Enjoy the meal " during a dinner scene , a phrase not proper for the time period . The writer commented , " Everything I have put into it is based entirely on fact . It just happens to be a story that not many people are familiar with . " Fellowes has remarked that while he would not alter the " fundamental truth " , such as the characters ' real relationships to each other , he strove to " use episodes to illustrate the journey you 're taking your characters , and with them , your audience " . 
 Although largely faithful to a selection of historical facts , the film has drawn criticism for embellishing on events in order to increase dramatic potential . For example , Prince Albert was never shot during an assassination attempt on Queen Victoria . Fellowes told BBC Radio 4 's Film Programme that in actuality the prince did put his body before the queen as protection , and that showing Prince Albert having been grazed by the bullet in the film was added to best show his bravery and devotion as he tried to stop Queen Victoria from being shot . 
 Another departure from history comes during Victoria 's coronation scene . Contrary to what is shown in the film , Albert was not present at the ceremony ; the couple instead wrote letters to each other , but Fellowes felt that having them keep opening letters would be less cinematic . Furthermore , according to Fellowes , " The scene where [ Conroy ] is trying to make her sign the paper when she is ill and she throws it to the floor - it 's completely true " , and " The scene in Windsor where the King stands up and insults Victoria 's mother is not only true , but about two @-@ thirds of his speech is what he actually said ! " However , the Duchess of Kent was seated next to the King when he spoke and did not leave during the speech ; and , <unk> in the film , the princess burst into tears , " and the two parties , soon realising that they had gone too far , patched up an uneasy truce " . According to Charles Greville 's memoirs : " The Queen [ Adelaide ] looked in deep distress , the Princess [ Victoria ] burst into tears , and the whole company were aghast . The Duchess of Kent said not a word . Immediately after they rose and retired , and a terrible scene ensued ; the Duchess announced her immediate departure and ordered her carriage , but a sort of reconciliation was patched up , and she was prevailed upon to stay till the next day . " 
 William Lamb , 2nd Viscount Melbourne , who was prime minister when Victoria came to the throne and a political mentor to the young queen , was forty years her senior , but is portrayed as a much younger man in the film . As for King Leopold , he was her favourite uncle whose advice she constantly sought ; her interest in Albert was due not to the latter 's success in wooing her , but simply to please Leopold . 
 Victoria 's great @-@ great @-@ granddaughter Queen Elizabeth II viewed the film in a special screening ; according to one source , she believed the film had a " lot of good points " , but was unhappy with the change to the assassination attempt , and also thought the British officers ' costumes looked too German . Apart from the assassination attempt , historian Alex von Tunzelmann noted that " historically , [ the film 's ] not at all bad " , and especially praised the depiction of contemporary politics and the characteristics Friend put into his performance as Prince Albert .

 Director Vallée used his background as a DJ to " create a structure for a film using music with the right rhythm and balance . I wanted to combine classical pieces with a rock spirit " . During filming Vallée often played rock music , such as the Rolling Stones , to create the right " mood " before a scene . Executive producer Colin <unk> knew composer Ilan <unk> , and hired him for the film . Sinéad O 'Connor performed " Only You " , which O 'Sullivan described as " very much in line with one of the overriding aims of the film , which was to be hopeful and tell people that these amazing love stories really can happen , it ’ s not just a fairy tale .

 The film received a generally positive reception and holds a 76 % ' Fresh ' rating on Rotten Tomatoes based on 145 reviews . Entertainment Weekly film critic Owen Gleiberman gave The Young Victoria a B + ; he gave praise to Emily Blunt 's performance and concluded , " The Young Victoria has a subtler flow than you might expect , and at times it 's calmer than you may like . Director Jean @-@ Marc Vallée 's images have a creamy stateliness , but this is no gilded princess fantasy — it 's the story of a budding ruler who learns to control her surroundings , and Blunt makes that journey at once authentic and relevant . " Manohla Dargis of The New York Times called it a " frivolously entertaining film " and believed it was " directed with some snap by Jean @-@ Marc Vallée " . Dargis finished her review , " Despite the filmmakers ’ efforts to persuade us that The Young Victoria is a serious work , and despite some tense moments and gunfire , the film ’ s pleasures are as light as its story . No matter . Albert may never rip Victoria ’ s bodice , but he does eventually loosen it , to her delight and ours . " 
 The Daily Telegraph called The Young Victoria a " production of the highest calibre with an impeccable cast . " The Times ' Wendy Ide gave the film 3 out 5 stars wrote " It 's decorative , but suffers from a stultifying lack of drama " and found similarities to the 1998 film Elizabeth . Ide found Victoria and Albert 's relationship to be " persuasive and rather charming , " and praised the performances of both the main and supporting cast , particularly noting Bettany 's scene @-@ stealing performance . 
 Less positive was Peter Bradshaw , film critic for The Guardian , who gave the film two out of five stars . While initially looking forward to Blunt 's performance , he believed the " black @-@ belt minx " actress was " never really allowed to let rip . All that coiled feline sensuality stay [ ed ] coiled " . He thought the queen 's relationship with Prince Albert " very , very unsexy " , as their devotion " makes for a boring film " . Bradshaw did praise the power dynamics around Victoria , but concluded " I spent an hour and three @-@ quarters waiting for this film to start . Where was the tang and the zing and the oomph of Fellowes 's cracking script for Robert Altman 's Gosford Park ? "

 = Glanville Davies affair = 
 The Glanville Davies affair was a scandal in the English legal profession which resulted in greater reform of the regulatory processes for solicitors and was one of the justifications for the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 . Glanville Davies was a well @-@ respected solicitor and a member of the Council of the Law Society of England and Wales who massively overcharged his client , Leslie Persons , sending him a bill for £ 197 @,@ 000 that was reduced on taxation to £ 67 @,@ 000 . Davies was not punished by the Law Society 's internal regulatory committees , which allowed him to resign from the council on the grounds of ill @-@ health with his reputation intact . Following litigation and public criticism , the Law Society commissioned an internal report that found " administrative failures , wrong decisions , mistakes , errors of judgement , failures in communication and insensitivity " . A private member 's bill reformed the way in which the Law Society investigated disciplinary complaints , although not to the extent initially proposed , and paved the way for the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 that created an independent disciplinary body . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1982 , Leslie Parsons filed a complaint against Glanville Davies , a respected solicitor and member of the Council of the Law Society of England and Wales , the solicitors ' professional body . Davies had charged Parsons £ 197 @,@ 000 for legal services , a " grossly inflated and inaccurate legal bill " . Parsons complained to the Law Society repeatedly from 1976 to 1982 ; despite this , the Law Society took no disciplinary action , allowing Davies to resign from the Council on grounds of ill @-@ health with his reputation intact . Parsons finally brought legal action against Davies in 1982 , and on 18 November , Anthony McCowan of the High Court of Justice reduced the bill to £ 67 @,@ 000 . McCowan also said that Davies was " guilty of at least gross and persistent misconduct " and recommended that he be struck off . On 24 October 1983 , Vinelott J struck Davies from the roll of solicitors . 
 = = Investigation = = 
 Following the start of litigation , an investigation by the Lay Observer and the Law Society itself ( which became known as the Ely Report ) highlighted " an appalling catalogue of errors , insensitivity and poor judgment " in the handling of the Davies Affair by the Law Society internal disciplinary organisation . The report found " administrative failures , wrong decisions , mistakes , errors of judgement , failures in communication and insensitivity ... the whole affair was a disgrace to the Society " . The Society paid compensation to Parsons for their mishandling of the situation and said that they would compensate victims of similar cases where they had failed to investigate complaints with reasonable care . 
 The Law Society asked Coopers & <unk> to produce a report on the Law Society , which included its disciplinary topics among the areas to be reported on . The draft report , published in 1984 , recommended that the Law Society should transfer its disciplinary processes to an independent Solicitor 's Complaints Board , which would be made up of both solicitors and lay people ( although with a majority of its members being solicitors ) . In 1985 the National Consumer Council published a survey showing that only 15 % of respondents felt that the Law Society should be investigating complaints , and only 5 % felt that if an independent body was created it should contain a solicitor majority , with 36 % wanting equal representation of solicitors and lay people and 55 % preferring a majority of lay people . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 As a result of this and similar controversies , Alf Dubs introduced a private member 's bill named the Solicitors ( Independent Complaints Procedure ) Bill on 12 February 1985 , which would move the responsibility of regulating the solicitors profession to a body outside the Law Society . Professional opinion was split on this – the National Consumer Council , Legal Action Group and many of the smaller law societies supported the proposal , while larger law societies and the Law Society of England and Wales opposed it . 
 The Law Society of England and Wales persuaded Coopers & <unk> to include an alternate reform proposal in their report , and after pressure from the Law Society , and several of the larger regional societies , the alternate proposal was used . This was far weaker than the original proposal , and kept the responsibility of regulating the solicitors ' profession within the Law Society but increased the separation of functions within the Society and required that the majority of the people on regulatory committees be lay people ( not solicitors ) . The events surrounding this scandal have been directly linked to the reforms pushed through in the Courts and Legal Services Act 1990 , which created an independent disciplinary body for solicitors . 
 = Lacrymosa ( song ) = 
 " Lacrymosa " is a song recorded by American rock band Evanescence for their second studio album , The Open Door ( 2006 ) . The song was composed by Amy Lee and Terry Balsamo and produced by Dave Fortman . " Lacrymosa " incorporates the Lacrimosa sequence from Mozart 's Requiem ( 1791 ) throughout the song and Lee said that its main inspiration is the film Amadeus . The song is influenced by genres such as alternative metal , gothic rock , and post @-@ grunge . Set in slow tempo , it was originally written in the key of D minor but Lee and Balsamo transposed it into E minor . 
 The song garnered polarizing opinions from music critics , with some labeling it as one of the best songs on The Open Door , particularly complimenting the backing choir , while others lamented it one of the worst for the same reasons . According to Lee , " Lacrymosa " was originally written for the soundtrack of the movie The Chronicles of Narnia : The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe , but was not included because of its dark sound . The producers of Narnia , however , rebutted her claim , stating this information was " news to them " and that no Evanescence music had been planned for inclusion in the soundtrack . The song was part of the setlist during their The Open Door Tour .

 " Lacrymosa " was written by Amy Lee and Terry Balsamo and produced by Dave Fortman .

" ) and backing vocals throughout the song . Lee , the orchestra and choir recorded the song at a chapel in Seattle , Washington . In a number of interviews , Lee revealed that everyone asked about a collaboration between her and Mozart . She further stated that she always wanted to make Lacrimosa from Mozart 's Requiem a metal song , later adding that The Open Door was " the time for that , for trying things I hadn 't been brave enough to try before . " In an interview with VH1 News , Lee further explained the inspiration behind the song 
 " I saw Amadeus when I was nine years old and fell in love with Mozart . The part of Mozart 's Requiem called " <unk> " [ sic ] is my favorite piece of music ever . I always wished we could cover it , but with programming and guitars and make it cool . It 's our moment to try all the things I wanted to and couldn 't , so I started messing with it in Protools .

The instruments in the song are piano , guitar , violins and drums . Lee 's vocal range from the note of B3 and E5 ; the SATB choir ranges from the note of B2 to E4 . " Lacrymosa " has a " violin intro , synth worth of a Nine Inch Nails album , and Omen @-@ esque choral sections that are very haunting . " 
 According to Rob Sheffield from Rolling Stone , in " Lacrymosa " Lee is " sobbing hysterically over a grand piano . " According to the IGN reviewer , Ed Thompson , the song " takes the trademark Evanescence sound - Lee 's celestial voice , and adds her brooding lyrics ' I can 't change who I am , not this time , I won 't lie to keep you near me and in this short life , there 's no time to waste on giving up . My love wasn 't enough ' . " . Danielle <unk> from The Oshkosh West Index stated that " Lee 's astounding classical vocals are displayed with songs as the eerie ' Like You , ' and ' Lacrymosa ' . " She said that these two songs feature slower beats , and are more " piano @-@ themed melodies , followed shortly by the power guitar section of the song . " But she said that the song was very similar to " Haunted " from Fallen adding , " creepy background choir vocals and violins send listeners into a gothic Cathedral @-@ like setting .

 " Lacrymosa " received positive to mixed reviews from music critics . Bill Lamb from About.com put the song in the list of Top Tracks on The Open Door alongside " Sweet Sacrifice " , " Call Me When You 're Sober " , " Your Star " and " Good Enough " . He added " Elements such as the connection of the song ' Lacrymosa ' to the Mozart ' Requiem ' movement of the same name , or intense exploration of the benefits and costs of ' Lithium ' give hints that Evanescence could add intellectual heft to their obvious command of emotion . " Ed Thompson from IGN called " Lacrymosa " the " most memorable track " in the whole album . Don Kaye of the website Blabbermouth.net said that while the song was an " interesting experiment " it came " across as more of a stab at <unk> with its strings and choirs than a real song . " 
 An editor from The New York Times said that " Lacrymosa " is grandiose even by the album ’ s standards . Sputnikmusic said that the song is the best on the album and gave the song a grade of 4 @.@ 5 along with " Good Enough " , adding that on the last two songs the album stops to be boring because of the variations . Simon Cosyns from The Sun concluded that " song titles such as ' Weight of the World ' , ' Lose Control ' and ' Lacrymosa ' tell you it ’ s not a bed of roses , but there is a positive streak running through The Open Door " . On Postmedia News it was stated that Lee " achieves stunning notes on ' Lacrymosa ' , which employs a haunting choir " . Jordan Reimer from The Daily Princetonian praised Lee 's melodies and said that " Cloud Nine " and " Lacrymosa " were her best two arrangements . John Hood from Miami New Times made a story , " ' Call Me When You 're Sober ' sent a man away , ' Lacrymosa ' kept him there , and ' Cloud Nine ' told the clueless <unk> why he would no longer ever be welcomed back . Joost Melis from the Dutch website <unk> ! compared " Lacrymosa " with song of the bands Within Temptation and Nightwish . A writer of The Independent put the song on his list of " Download This " from The Open Door . 
 Brendan Butler from Cinema Blend was critical saying that " the worst song on The Open Door , i [ t ’ ] s a toss up between ' Lacrymosa ' with its abominable choir and the obnoxious ' Lose Control , ' which features Amy crying for about five minutes . " A reviewer from <unk> noted that the weakest tracks on the album are " Snow White Queen " , " Lacrymosa " , " Like You " , and " Lose Control " because " the vocal <unk> on those tracks just do not flow with the lyrics and music combined therefore making them annoying because [ Lee 's ] voice gets a bit unsettling and can only be tolerable to a certain extent .

 = Billy Sing = 
 William Edward " Billy " Sing , DCM ( 2 March 1886 – 19 May 1943 ) was a part Chinese Australian soldier who served in the Australian Imperial Force during World War I , best known as a sniper during the Gallipoli Campaign . He took at least 150 confirmed kills during that campaign , and may have had over 200 kills in total . One contemporary estimate put his tally at close to 300 kills . Towards the end of the war , Sing married a Scottish woman , but the relationship did not last long . Following work in sheep farming and gold mining , he died in relative poverty and obscurity in Brisbane during World War II . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Sing was born on 2 March 1886 in Clermont , Queensland , Australia , the son of a Chinese father and an English mother . His parents were John Sing ( c . 1842 – 1921 ) , a drover from Shanghai , China , and Mary Ann Sing ( née Pugh ; c . 1857 – unknown ) , a nurse from <unk> , Staffordshire , England . Sing 's mother had given birth to a daughter named Mary Ann Elizabeth Pugh on 28 May 1883 , less than two months before marrying Sing 's father on 4 July 1883 . It is unclear whether this child was John Sing 's daughter as well . A daughter , Beatrice Sing , was later born into the family on 12 July 1893 . The three children grew up together on the farm run by the Sings , and all three performed well academically . 
 There was considerable anti @-@ Chinese sentiment in Australia at this time . As a boy , Sing was well known for his shooting skill , but was the subject of racial prejudice due to his ancestry . He began work hauling timber as a youth , and later worked as a stockman and a sugarcane cutter . Sing became well known for his marksmanship , both as a kangaroo shooter and as a competitive target shooter . In the latter role , he was a member of the Proserpine Rifle Club . He regularly won prizes for his shooting , and also played cricket with skill . 
 On 24 October 1914 , two months after the outbreak of war , Sing enlisted as a trooper in the Australian 5th Light Horse Regiment of the Australian Imperial Force . His Certificate of Medical Examination at the time showed that he stood at 5 ' 5 " ( 165 cm ) and weighed 141 lb . ( 64 kg ) . According to John Laws and Christopher Stewart , he was accepted into the army only after a recruitment officer chose to disregard the fact that Sing was part Chinese ; at the time , only those of European ancestry were generally considered suitable for Australian military service . 
 = = Military service = = 
 = = = Gallipoli Campaign = = = 
 Sing began his military career as part of the Australian and New Zealand Army Corps ( ANZAC ) forces in the Gallipoli Campaign in modern day Turkey . Biographer John Hamilton described the Turkish terrain thus : " It is a country made for snipers . The Anzac and Turkish positions often overlooked each other . Each side sent out marksmen to hunt and stalk and snipe , to wait and shoot and kill , creeping with stealth through the green and brown shrubbery ... " Sing partnered with spotters Ion ' Jack ' Idriess and , later , Tom Sheehan . The spotter 's task was to observe ( spot ) the surrounding terrain and alert the sniper to potential targets . Idriess described Sing as " a little chap , very dark , with a jet black moustache and goatee beard . A picturesque looking <unk> . He is the crack shot of the Anzacs . " 
 Chatham 's Post , a position named after a Light Horse officer , was Sing 's first sniping post . Biographer Brian Tate wrote , " It was here that Billy Sing began in earnest his lethal occupation . " He set about his task with a Lee – Enfield .303 rifle . An account by Private Frank Reed , a fellow Australian soldier , states that Sing was so close to the Turkish lines that enemy artillery rarely troubled him . His comrades left three particular enemy positions to his attention : a trench at 350 yards ( 320 m ) from his post , a communication sap at 500 yards ( 457 m ) , and a track in a gully at 1 @,@ 000 yards ( 914 m ) . According to Reed , " Every time Billy Sing felt sorry for the poor Turks , he remembered how their snipers picked off the Australian officers in the early days of the landing , and he hardened his heart . But he never fired at a stretcher @-@ bearer or any of the soldiers who were trying to rescue wounded Turks . " In contrast , Hamilton said in a 2008 interview , " We have an anecdote where , after spotting an injured Turk , he said ' I 'll put that poor cuss out of his agony ' and just shot him . He was a very tough man . " 
 Sing 's reputation resulted in a champion Turkish sniper , nicknamed ' Abdul the Terrible ' by the Allied side , being assigned to deal with him . Tate alleges that the Turks were largely able to distinguish Sing 's sniping from that of other ANZAC soldiers , and that only the reports of incidents believed to be Sing 's work were passed on to Abdul . Through analysis of the victims ' actions and wounds , Abdul concluded that Sing 's position was at Chatham 's Post . After several days , Sing 's spotter alerted him to a potential target , and he took aim , only to find the target — Abdul — looking in his direction . Sing prepared to fire , trying not to reveal his position , but the Turkish sniper noticed him and began his own firing sequence . Sing fired first and killed Abdul . Very shortly thereafter , the Turkish artillery fired on Sing 's position — he and his spotter barely managed to evacuate from Chatham 's Post alive . 
 Near the beginning of August 1915 , Sing was hospitalised for four days with influenza . That same month , an enemy sniper 's bullet struck Sheehan 's spotting telescope , injuring his hands and face , and then hit Sing 's shoulder , but the latter was back in action after a week 's recuperation . Sheehan was more severely wounded , and was shipped back to Australia . This was reportedly the only time that Sing was injured at Gallipoli . He would not fare so well later on in the war . 
 = = = Sniping record = = = 
 Sing 's marksmanship at Gallipoli saw him dubbed ' The Assassin ' or ' The Murderer ' by his comrades . He reportedly acquired the latter nickname due to his callous attitude towards the enemy . By early September 1915 , he had taken 119 kills , according to Brigadier @-@ General Granville Ryrie , commanding officer of the 2nd Australian Light Horse Brigade . Regimental records list Sing as having taken 150 confirmed kills , but on 23 October 1915 , General William Birdwood , commander of ANZAC forces , issued an order complimenting him on his 201 unconfirmed kills . Historian Bob Courtney noted that an official kill was recorded only if the spotter saw the target fall . If the first shot missed the target , it was very risky to take a second shot , as this could give away the sniper team 's position . 
 Major Stephen Midgely estimated Sing 's tally at close to 300 kills . Midgely had brought him to the attention of Birdwood , who in turn had told Lord Kitchener that " if his troops could match the capacity of the Queensland sniper the allied forces would soon be in Constantinople . " Birdwood had reportedly joined Sing as his spotter on one occasion , and had the opportunity to witness his marksmanship first hand . 
 In February 1916 , Sing was Mentioned in Despatches by General Sir Ian Hamilton , Commander of the Allied Forces . This was the first official recognition of his service . On 10 March 1916 , he was awarded the Distinguished Conduct Medal , with a related entry in military records reading : " For conspicuous gallantry from May to September , 1915 , at Anzac , as a sniper . His courage and skill were most marked , and he was responsible for a very large number of casualties among the enemy , no risk being too great for him to take . " Apart from the recognition he received from his superiors , Sing 's exploits were also reported in British and American newspapers of the time . 
 = = = Western Front = = = 
 At the end of November 1915 , Sing suffered from myalgia and was confined to the hospital ship HMHS Gloucester Castle for almost two weeks . During this time , he was conveyed to Malta , then Ismaïlia , Egypt . While in Egypt , he was also hospitalised with <unk> and mumps , but rejoined his unit at the end of March 1916 . 
 Sing transferred to the 31st Infantry Battalion on 27 July 1916 at Tel @-@ el @-@ <unk> and sailed to England the following month . Following a brief period of training in England , he sailed for France and entered action on the Western Front in January 1917 . He was wounded in action several times , and commended many times in reports by Allied commanders . In March 1917 , he was wounded in the left leg and hospitalised in England . In May 1917 , while recovering in Scotland , he met waitress Elizabeth A. Stewart ( c . 1896 – unknown ) , who was the daughter of Royal Navy cook George Stewart . The two were married on 29 June 1917 in Edinburgh . In July 1917 , Elizabeth Sing 's address was noted in records as 6 Spring Gardens , Stockbridge , Edinburgh . 
 After a month with his new wife , Sing returned to the trenches in France in August 1917 , but was in very poor health due to his battle wounds and the effects of gas poisoning . It is not clear whether he operated as a sniper on the Western Front , but in September 1917 , he led a unit in the Battle of Polygon Wood in counter @-@ sniper operations . For this action , he was awarded the <unk> ( Belgian Croix de Guerre ) in 1918 , and was also recommended for the Military Medal — but never received it . In November 1917 , he was confined to hospital again due to problems with his previously wounded leg . In mid @-@ February 1918 , he was hospitalised due to a gunshot wound in the back . Sing suffered lung disease from his exposure to gas , and it soon brought his military career to an end . 
 = = Return to civilian life = = 
 Sing returned to Australia on submarine guard duty in late July 1918 . An army medical report from 23 November 1918 noted that he had gunshot wounds in the left shoulder , back , and left leg , and had suffered gas poisoning . The report stated that his general health was ' good ' but that he complained of coughing upon exertion . It recognised that Sing 's disability were the result of service , was permanent , and recommended that he be discharged as permanently unfit for service . Following his departure from the army , he briefly turned his hand to sheep farming , but the land he was given was of poor quality . He then worked as a gold miner . 
 According to some accounts , Sing and his wife were honoured by the local community when they arrived in Proserpine , Queensland , in late 1918 . Other accounts , however , state that although Sing arranged for passage from Scotland to Australia for his wife , there was no evidence that she made the journey . If Sing 's wife did come to Australia , it appears that she left her husband after a few years ; Tate suggests that the " transition from the green hills and ancient culture of Edinburgh to the dust and rough life of the mining district around Clermont must have been traumatic for Elizabeth Sing " and might have been a reason for her departure . 
 Recent research has shown that Elizabeth remained in Edinburgh . She had had daughter ( Mary ) in 1919 and and a son ( Theo ) in 1924 , to different fathers ( neither of whom was Billy Sing ) . She travelled to Australia sometime between 1925 and 1930 , with her two children . She lived in New South Wales with her son 's father until her death in Wollongong in the 1970s . It is not known whether she had any contact with Billy after her arrival in Australia .

 In later life , Sing reported chest , back , and heart pain . His final days were spent in relative poverty and obscurity . His elder sister or half @-@ sister , Mary Ann Elizabeth , had died in childbirth in 1915 . In 1942 , Sing moved from <unk> to Brisbane , telling his surviving sister Beatrice that it was cheaper to live there . His final occupation was as a labourer . 
 Sing died alone in his room in a boarding house in West End , Brisbane , on 19 May 1943 . The cause of death was a ruptured aorta . His only significant possessions were a hut ( worth around £ 20 ) on a mining claim and a mere 5 shillings found with him in his room . There was no sign of his medals from World War I , and his employers owed him around £ 6 in wages . Sing was buried in the Lutwyche War Cemetery , in <unk> , a northern suburb of Brisbane . His grave is now part of the lawn cemetery section of the Lutwyche Cemetery , and the inscription on his headstone reads :

 The Queensland Military Historical Society set up a bronze plaque at 304 Montague Road , South Brisbane , where Sing had died . In 1995 , a statue of Sing was unveiled with honour in his home town of Clermont . In 2004 , an Australian Army sniper team in Baghdad named their post the ' Billy Sing Bar & Grill . ' On 19 May 2009 , the 66th anniversary of Sing 's death , the Chinese Consul @-@ General , Ren <unk> , along with Returned and Services League of Australia officers and community leaders , laid wreaths at his grave . Ren said , " Billy Sing is a symbol of the long history of Chinese in Australia , and the great role they have played in your nation 's past ... It also reminds us that China and Australia were allies through both world wars , and that we have a long and proud shared past . " 
 Sing 's life was recounted in a chapter of Laws and Stewart 's book , There 's always more to the story ( 2006 ) , and in greater depth by Hamilton in his book , Gallipoli Sniper : The life of Billy Sing ( 2008 ) . Hamilton 's book includes a detailed account of how snipers worked at Gallipoli and their contribution to the progress of the campaign . Reviewer John Wadsley wrote that " Hamilton is able to bring together a range of sources to create the story , and while at times , you get the feeling he is padding it out to make up for the lack of direct material about Billy Sing , the book works . " 
 A television mini @-@ series , The Legend of Billy Sing , was in post @-@ production as of 2010 . Despite some reports that it was based on Hamilton 's book , the author maintained that he was never contacted by the film makers . Although Sing and his father were partly Chinese and fully Chinese , respectively , the mini @-@ series portrayed them with actors of European ancestry . The director , Geoff Davis , was criticised for this decision . Politician Bill O <unk> , a member of the Billy Sing Commemorative Committee , said , " When a person dies , all that is left is their story , and you can ’ t take a person ’ s name and not tell the truth about their story . " Davis has said , " Whatever [ Sing 's ] genetic background , his culture was Australian . To me , he 's very representative of every Australian whose parents were not born here . ... A lot of people are sitting at the back of this bus attacking the driver . A lot of people feel they own the story of Billy Sing . But they 've probably got more resources than me — if they want to tell that story , then tell it . " 
 Hamilton characterised Sing as " a cold @-@ blooded killer ... [ yet ] a man with a sense of humour ... the Anzac angel of death , " and Laws and Stewart described him simply as " one of many Australians of Chinese descent who served with distinction in the Australian forces during World War I. " Around 400 people of Chinese descent served in Australia 's military forces during the 20th century . 
 A memorial to Sing stands at Hood 's Lagoon , in his birthplace of Clermont , Queensland . 
 For the 100th anniversary commemoration of the Gallipoli landings , a monument was erected to Sing in the Lutwyche Cemetery in Brisbane , near his grave stone , by the Billy Sing Memorial Committee . It was officially unveiled on the anniversary of his death .

She is played by actress Katherine Kelly . Becky was created by producer Steve Frost as a recurring character . She made her debut in the episode airing on 5 February 2006 . Kelly was initially contracted to appear for three months , but became a series regular after impressing the serial 's producers . In early 2011 Kelly announced her decision to leave the soap . Producer Phil Collinson created dramatic storylines in the build @-@ up to her exit . 
 Becky 's storylines have focused on her friendship with Roy ( David Neilson ) and Hayley Cropper ( Julie Hesmondhalgh ) , which helped change public opinion of the character , and her relationships with Jason Grimshaw ( Ryan Thomas ) and Steve McDonald ( Simon Gregson ) , with the latter producing two wedding storylines which were highly publicised by ITV .

Kelly has garnered various awards and nominations for her portrayal of Becky . 
 = = Character creation and casting = = 
 Becky was created as a short @-@ term recurring character , working in the Underworld sewing factory . The character was deemed popular so producers decided to bring her back , with executive producer Steve Frost initially pitching the idea of bringing in her family , stating : " Becky will leave Weatherfield for a short period of time and shock the Street 's residents when her relatives return with her . " However , this never materialised and Becky returned without any relatives . It was also thought that producers were going to kill the character off , in her early stages . 
 Auditions were held for the role of Becky which required the auditionee to look deliberately scruffy . Actress Katherine Kelly commented : " I was told to turn up looking as crap as possible , with no make @-@ up . But that morning I 'd also been for an audition where I had to look really glamorous . So I sat on the Tube putting grease in my hair and wiping my make @-@ up off with everyone looking at me . By the time I got there I looked a right state ! " . Kelly was initially only cast for a three @-@ month period when she began filming in 2006 , but impressed producers and was offered an extended contract as a regular character . On 17 June 2008 , after further impressing the producers , Kelly was signed for an additional 12 months . In February 2009 , Kelly again had her contract extended , securing her role in the soap until August 2011 . However , in 2010 Kelly was signed to a new 18 @-@ month contract by new producer Phil Collinson , a contract which was described as " unprecedented " at the time . 
 In 2011 Kelly decided to quit the role . She said it was one of the " hardest decisions of her life " but felt it was the right time to " say goodbye to Becky " . Executive producer Phil Collinson remarked that Kelly was talented and managed to make Becky into a " firm favourite " with viewers . Kelly finished filming her final scenes as Becky on 9 December 2011 .

 The Daily Mirror 's Beth Neil has observed that during her time on Coronation Street , Becky has morphed " from a thieving tearaway into a vulnerable young woman , clearly damaged from a troubled upbringing . " Kelly has commented that Becky finds it hard to rely on others , as she is : " Very out of sorts , because she 's a very independent , feisty sort of character . " She has stated that she loves Becky 's " trailer trash " appearance . 
 Becky is not an aspirational character , she strives to be normal , satisfied with a " hard up lifestyle " . She has changed since her early days , having calmed down a little in terms of her often out of control behaviour . Of this Kelly comments : " If someone had said to me that in three years ' time she 'd be Becky McDonald and would be behind the bar in the Rovers , I wouldn 't have believed it [ ... ] When Becky first came in she was a totally different character , but she 's calmed down a lot and her softer side has come out . " 
 Becky became the 50th barmaid at the Rovers Return Inn in June 2008 . Kelly opined that the character 's ex @-@ con personality would give her an advantage behind the bar , explaining : " The previous producer , Steve Frost , loved the idea of a barmaid who could lose her temper and throw a punch . Becky 's an ex @-@ con so she can fight dirty like nobody else . " The character 's chain smoking tendencies often play out onscreen when she is experiencing stress , something which drew off @-@ screen criticism for her disregard of littering the streets with her cigarette butts . ITV publicity has described Becky as having many different levels to her persona , stating that she loves drinking cider , and that she isn 't bothered by how she looks — though when she dresses up she " dresses to the nines " with big earrings , gold rings , logo belts and hair pieces . She dislikes anyone ordering her about , as she cannot handle being told what to do . 
 Kelly has also revealed that she often changes the material within scripts to play out best how she thinks Becky would act in certain situations . Kelly stated she didn 't think Becky would slap other characters , rather opting for punches . She stated : " The script often says , ' Becky slaps Steve ' but we try to find a different way to do it . I always think she wouldn 't slap , she would punch " Kelly was behind other violent scenes featuring her character , adding " The slap is too common in soaps " . 
 = = = Relationships = = = 
 Becky formed a friendship with local residents Roy ( David Neilson ) and Hayley Cropper ( Julie Hesmondhalgh ) . Becky 's on @-@ screen partnership with Roy was particularly successful . Kelly stated it was the turning point in her character 's development that won public affection , whilst Neilson stated that it was an " arranged marriage " by producers , delighted with its outcome . Becky 's first serious romantic relationship in the soap was with builder Jason Grimshaw ( Ryan Thomas ) . Their relationship was a turning point in what has been described as a " journey " for the character . Kelly spoke of Becky 's different attributes in their relationship , during an interview stating : " She absolutely believes that she 's 100 % in love with him . I see it as a very teenage relationship because of the on @-@ off status . Becky 's very mature in many ways – she 's very streetwise and if you needed something , you 'd go to Becky and she 'd find it for you . But emotionally , she 's very immature . That 's a lot to do with why she gets on so well with Roy because he 's quite emotionally immature , too . It 's probably the one level that they do connect on . " Fans approached the actress in the streets , claiming they were jealous of her because of her on @-@ screen romance with Jason . Following her breakup with Jason , and the aftermath which was highly publicised in the media , such as the Daily Mirror , and The Sun commenting on the plot . 
 She then embarked on an affair with fellow resident Steve McDonald ( Simon Gregson ) . Kelly stated during an interview that she felt Becky was " punching above her weight " with Jason . Kelly revealed that she felt Steve was the best man for Becky over her previous lover Jason , stating : " Both boys bring out different things in Becky . With Jason , they liked going clubbing , and it was no strings attached , I think Becky needs more than that , even though she wouldn 't admit it . I think , long @-@ term , Steve 's better for her . " When Gregson was interviewed by entertainment website Digital Spy , he was asked if he thought that his character has had a positive impact on Becky 's life . In reply he stated : " I think he 's turned it around . She was all over the place getting into trouble all the time but he 's made her grow up . And having a little girl there in Amy , that 's made her grow a bit , too . She 's got responsibilities now . She 's besotted with him . She 's still a total <unk> , though ! " Steve and Becky attempted to marry twice in 2009 ; their first wedding was given a promotional push from ITV , which aired adverts for the first wedding episodes . Their relationship was featured in a serious of <unk> plots in which ITV dubbed the " Summer of Love " season of the soap , with advertisements airing . 
 In 2009 Slug ( Marshall Lancaster ) , who had been seen on @-@ screen dating Becky in her early appearances , returned . The two characters share a backstory , which was partially created by Lancaster and Kelly themselves . During an interview with Digital Spy Kelly spoke the impact Slug has had on Becky stating : " Marshall and I have invented a whole back story between us . It 's nice to remember where Becky came from and what a journey she 's had . Slug was an important part of Becky 's life – they ’ ve got a lot of history . They grew up together and looked out for each other . " The storyline progresses into Slug confessing his love for Becky . Kelly points out that Becky has been on a journey , subsequently changing , stating that " Becky and Slug didn 't know what love was " and that she proves she has changed by rejecting his advances . 
 Becky later forged a friendship with Claire Peacock ( Julia Haworth ) , of this unlikely love / hate friendship Kelly stated : " Claire and Becky strike up a weird , weird friendship because the kids are a similar age , Josh and Amy . [ ... ] So the trouble begins , One minute [ Becky and Claire ] are good friends and the next , they 're really not . " Becky 's relationship with her mother was never shown onscreen , but when she died Kelly stated : " Becky hated her , and the death has brought back a lot of bad memories . " In 2010 it was announced that Becky 's half sister would join the cast , with Kelly stating : " We 've got some really , really exciting stuff happening . Becky 's going to get a half @-@ sister – a younger sister " . Kelly had stated that her family was not introduced on @-@ screen because producers didn 't want to " pin her character down " with one set of characters . 
 = = = Miscarriage and adoption = = = 
 In 2010 , the character underwent changes in appearance and direction with Becky suffering two miscarriages . Kelly branded the storyline challenging , admitting she felt a huge responsibility to get it right , stating : " It 's definitely been the hardest thing I 've done since I 've been here . I think the responsibility to do it well that you feel is huge . " Kelly also spoke of the sadness she felt for the impact the plot has on her character adding : " She can 't really put up any barriers about this – it 's the worst thing that 's ever happened . She goes from being a girl to a woman , I think . I 'm just devastated for her " . Kelly brands the storyline as her hardest , " Most of Becky ’ s storylines have an element of fun in there somewhere , but with this one it was just like a cloud was hanging over me for six weeks . " 
 However , Becky and Steve decide to adopt , in a storyline which was originally meant for Liz McDonald ( Bev Callard ) . It was revealed that Becky was given the storyline because producer Kim Crowther was determined to feature such a plot . Becky does not like the idea at first thinking she would make a bad mother , later changing her mind . The storyline saw various character changes implemented to Becky , in real life Kelly was forced to reduce the length of her hair . This was written into scripts to fit with the adoption storyline , which saw Becky changing her wardrobe to fool social workers . Of this Kelly stated : " With the adoption storyline , she borrows Claire Peacock 's clothes for a while because she wants to look good for the social worker coming round . We thought it was a good opportunity for her to have a slight image change . " Kelly further spoke of her admiration of her characters former image adding : " I love Becky with long hair and if it could have been possible I 'd have kept her with long blonde hair forever but sometimes nature and practicalities take over ! " 
 In an interview with tabloid newspaper Daily Mirror , Kelly revealed that she researched the storyline at the Manchester Adoption Society , who expressed their delight that two high profile characters were given such a plot . Kelly initially thought Becky would not be able to adopt because of her criminal record , but the society pointed out that the storyline would highlight the fact that adoption is possible for previous offenders , with Kelly stating : " They said the two main things they look for are stability in a family and a lot of back @-@ up at home , which Becky and Steve have with Roy , Hayley and Liz . " On what kind of mother Becky will be , Kelly added : " She 'd either palm it off on Roy and Hayley and the Barlows , or she would be over @-@ protective and not want it to have the life she had . " 
 = = = Kylie and Max = = = 
 Producers later introduced a half @-@ sister for Becky , in the form of Kylie Turner ( Paula Lane ) . Kylie was initially described as having a " full on " personality , similar to Becky . When she arrives , she ruins her and Steve 's plans for adoption . She and Kylie brawl violently over the incident ; Lane received bruising from filming the scenes . They were so violent that they were toned down before transmission . Kelly described Kylie and Becky as having a love @-@ hate relationship with her , but at the time she " wants to kill her " . Lane herself stated that Kylie loves Becky but " feels resentful that she left home when she was only eight . Becky was like a mother to Kylie . " 
 It is then revealed Kylie has a son , Max ( Harry McDermott ) who is in foster care . Lane stated that when she gets Max back , Kylie takes advantage of Becky 's bond with him . In another storyline , Kylie makes a pass at Steve . Steve decides not to tell Becky because he knows Kylie will take Max away , as she is trouble . Kylie plays on the fact Becky is desperate for a child and offers to sell Max to her . Gregson said he felt it immoral to buy a child , but stressed " Kylie isn ’ t an ordinary mother – she only cares about herself . " He said that Steve believes Max would be better off with him and Becky . Steve is first to take Kylie seriously , Gregson believed this was because Kylie has " proved herself ruthless " and " not the best mum " . Lane was so shocked with the storyline that she had to take breaks from filming scenes .

 While writing the scene with Meredith and Shepherd fighting , Rater explained that she was intending to show how they matured , adding : " This is a real grown @-@ up argument . Meredith isn 't running away , getting all dark and going to Cristina for help getting out of her marriage . She 's staying and fighting . " While writing the episode , writers intended the theme of the episode to be " exposure " , but after the episode was filmed , realized it was " ambition " . Rater commented on this : " Derek wants to be Chief ; Meredith wants to do a procedure that she knows she isn ’ t ready for ; Cristina wants Teddy to stay . " In the episode , Oh 's character asked her fellow residents if they would choose love or surgery , if need be , with Stevens choosing love and Yang and Meredith choosing surgery . The Grey 's Anatomy staff offered the insight : " When we were first discussing this story we had a knock down drag out fight in the writers ' room – if you had to choose your love or your art , which would you choose ? And some of us came down on the Cristina side , and some of us came down on the Izzie side – that in the end love is all that matters . " At the conclusion of the episode , Karev ended his marriage to Stevens . Rater expressed that the writers decided to have the fictional couple break @-@ up , because Stevens wasn 't sick anymore , and Karev would not have left her when she was .

" Pascua also called Altman 's telling Hunt of what Yang told her " stereotypical " , and praised Chambers ' character for not taking Stevens back . Pascua was impressed with the chicken pox storyline , writing : 
 " Our odd form of comical relief came in the form of Callie . I loved how she was stuck in the " gauze paws " and that she still looked attractive even with blotchy red bumps on her face . Somehow Arizona can pull off a little white lie and it magically works for her . It ended up strengthening their relationship , as well . "

 His family moved twice when he was a child ; the second time settling in Suva where Serevi started secondary school . There he attended <unk> Memorial School .
