 = = The Legend of Alfred III , King of Mercia = = 
 According to a story recorded by the 16th century antiquarian John Leland , and derived by him from a now lost book in the possession of the Earls of Rutland at Belvoir Castle , there was once a King Alfred III of Mercia , who reigned in the 730s . Though no Mercian king was ever named Alfred , let alone three , if this story has any historical basis ( which Leland himself rejected ) it must presumably relate to Æthelbald . The legend states that Alfred III had occasion to visit a certain William de <unk> , alleged ancestor of the Earls of Rutland , at his castle near Grantham , and took a fancy to Willam 's three comely daughters . It was the king 's intention to take one as his mistress , but William threatened to kill whichever he chose rather than have her dishonoured in this way , whereupon Alfred " <unk> that he meant to take one of them to wife , and chose <unk> that had fat <unk> , and of her he had <unk> that wan first all the Saxons the monarchy of England . " A painting of this supposed incident was commissioned in 1778 by the then Duke of Rutland , but was destroyed in a fire in 1816 . 
 = 1971 Atlantic hurricane season = 
 The 1971 Atlantic hurricane season was fairly active with several notable storms . Hurricane Edith , the strongest of the season , was a Category 5 on the Saffir @-@ Simpson scale , the highest category on the scale . It struck Nicaragua at peak intensity , killing dozens , and later hit southern Louisiana . Until 2003 , Hurricane Ginger held the record for the longest known duration of a North Atlantic tropical cyclone , lasting 27 @.@ 25 days from early September to early October ; it is currently the second longest @-@ lasting Atlantic hurricane . Ginger moved ashore in North Carolina , producing heavy rains and damaging winds . An unnamed storm in August attained hurricane status further north than any other Atlantic hurricane . 
 The season officially began on June 1 , and lasted until November 30 , 1971 ; these dates conventionally delimit the period of each year when most tropical cyclones form in the Atlantic basin . With thirteen tropical storms , of which six became hurricanes , the season was active . Despite the activity , damage in the United States totaled about $ 235 million ( 1971 USD , $ 1 @.@ 37 billion 2016 USD ) , which National Hurricane Center forecaster Paul Hebert noted was " pretty small considering we had five storms in a row strike the U.S. " Most of the damage came from Tropical Storm Doria , which affected much of the East Coast of the United States . Hurricane Fern struck Texas after executing an unusual track , dropping heavy rainfall and producing flooding . The first storm , Arlene , developed on July 4 off the coast of North Carolina . Activity was steady through most of the season , and the last storm , Laura , dissipated on November 22 . 
 = = Storms = = 
 = = = Tropical Storm Arlene = = = 
 The origins of Arlene were from a cold front that exited the East Coast of the United States on July 2 and stalled offshore . A frontal wave developed the next day , steadily developing due to thermal instability . On July 4 , the system organized into a tropical depression about 120 mi ( 195 km ) southeast of Cape Hatteras , North Carolina . While in its formative stages , it dropped rainfall along the coast of the Carolinas , peaking at 4 @.@ 11 in ( 104 mm ) in <unk> , South Carolina . The depression tracked northeastward due to a ridge over New England , and the cyclone passed just southeast of the Outer Banks . After a Hurricane Hunters plane observed gale force winds , the depression was upgraded to Tropical Storm Arlene late on July 5 ; in the post @-@ season summary , meteorologist Neil Frank noted , " the surprising element in the development of Arlene was the rapidity of the transformation process . " 
 Upon being named , Arlene continued northeastward , possessing a circular mass of convection with spiral rainbands . Late on July 6 , the storm attained peak winds of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) , based on a ship report . It weakened thereafter , and Arlene transitioned into an extratropical cyclone late on July 7 just south of Newfoundland . The cyclone last observed early the following day . The storm capsized a boat in the Grand Banks of Newfoundland , and the crew of 12 was rescued . 
 = = = Unnamed Hurricane = = = 
 A hybrid @-@ type depression formed east of Bermuda on July 29 . It moved rapidly southwestward before turning to a northwest drift . On August 3 , it was classified as a tropical depression , and the next day the system passed near Bermuda . The depression accelerated to the northeast , strengthening into a tropical storm on August 5 . It intensified further due to baroclinity , or enhanced instability through different levels of the atmosphere caused by temperature and moisture gradients . On August 6 , a drilling rig about 230 mi ( 370 km ) southeast of Newfoundland recorded sustained winds of 90 mph ( 140 km / h ) with gusts to 126 mph ( 204 km / h ) at an altitude of 325 ft ( 99 m ) ; this suggested the storm attained hurricane status at 46 ° North , which is the northernmost location for a tropical storm to intensify into a hurricane . 
 Despite the intensity , the cyclone was not purely tropical ; although the radius of maximum winds was only 35 mi ( 56 km ) , the thermal structure did not resemble a tropical cyclone , and there was no precipitation or convection near the center . It continued northeastward and dissipated on August 7 to the southwest of Greenland . It was not named operationally , but it was later added to the Atlantic hurricane database . 
 = = = Hurricane Beth = = = 
 On August 9 , an upper @-@ level low developed off the coast of Florida , and the next day spawned a tropical depression . The newly developed cyclone tracked slowly northeastward , eventually encountering conditions favorable for development . On August 14 , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Beth off the coast of North Carolina , and it quickly strengthened into a hurricane by August 15 . After reaching peak winds of 85 mph ( 137 km / h ) off the coast of Cape Cod , Beth slightly weakened and later moved ashore near Copper Lake , Nova Scotia . Shortly thereafter , Beth was swept up by a nearby cold front and transitioned into an extratropical cyclone . 
 The hurricane left extensive damage in its wake , especially to crops and infrastructure . Halifax International Airport reported 10 @.@ 49 in ( 266 mm ) of rainfall in a 30 ‑ hour span , which caused widespread flooding . Several bridges in the region were washed out , while railways were covered by water , forcing trains to suspend their operation . Overall monetary damage from Beth is estimated up to $ 5 @.@ 1 million ( 1971 USD , $ 29 @.@ 8 million 2016 USD ) . One person was indirectly killed by the hurricane in a traffic accident induced by heavy rainfall . 
 = = = Tropical Depression Eight = = = 
 On August 11 , Tropical Depression Eight developed southwest of Fort Myers , Florida . It quickly moved ashore , reaching Lake Okeechobee before looping to the northwest . While moving across the state , it dropped heavy rainfall of around 10 in ( 250 mm ) along the west coast . In Pinellas Park , the heavy rains led to flash flooding that forced 200 families from their house , including one that required evacuation from a helicopter . Damage in the region was estimated at $ 250 @,@ 000 ( 1971 USD , $ 1 @.@ 46 million 2016 USD ) . 
 The depression emerged into the Gulf of Mexico on August 15 near Tampa , and later turned to the northeast ahead of an upper @-@ level low . On August 16 , it intensified as it moved ashore near Cedar Key , where hurricane @-@ force wind gusts were briefly observed . The depression dissipated on August 17 over South Carolina , although in that state it produced its heaviest rainfall , totaling 14 @.@ 11 in ( 358 mm ) in Sullivan 's Island . In nearby Savannah , Georgia , the rainfall forced about 100 families from their houses in low @-@ lying areas . The remnants continued northeastward through the Mid @-@ Atlantic States and New England , crossing into Canada on August 20 . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Chloe = = = 
 A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 13 , moving westward for several days before organizing into a tropical depression on August 18 about 460 mi ( 740 km ) east of Barbados . It quickly moved through the Lesser Antilles , where it produced wind gusts up to 58 mph ( 93 km / h ) . The cyclone also dropped heavy rainfall up to 6 in ( 150 mm ) on Barbados and Martinique . After entering the eastern Caribbean Sea , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Chloe on August 20 . About 18 hours after attaining tropical storm status , Chloe quickly strengthened to peak winds of 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) about 215 mi ( 345 km ) south of the Mona Passage , as reported by reconnaissance aircraft . 
 After reaching peak intensity , Chloe began weakening as it turned to the west @-@ southwest , and late on August 22 , it was downgraded to a tropical depression as a weakening ridge to its north cut off the low @-@ level inflow . For several days it continued generally westward , gradually losing organization . While passing south of Jamaica , the storm prompted the evacuation of the SS Hope , a hospital ship , at Kingston . On August 25 , Chloe moved ashore in Belize as a weak tropical depression , and dissipated shortly thereafter without ever having caused significant damage or deaths . The remnants of Chloe later spawned Hurricane Lily in the eastern Pacific Ocean . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Doria = = = 
 Tropical Storm Doria , the costliest storm of the season , developed from a tropical wave on August 20 to the east of the Lesser Antilles , and after five days without development attained tropical storm status to the east of Florida . Doria turned to the north , and reached peak winds of 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) as it was making landfall near Morehead City , North Carolina . It turned to the northeast , and moved through the Mid @-@ Atlantic and New England as a tropical storm before becoming an extratropical storm over Maine on August 29 . 
 In North Carolina , Doria produced moderate rainfall , resulting in localized flooding and damage . The storm spawned a tornado near Norfolk , Virginia , damaging twelve houses and downing hundreds of trees . Tropical Storm Doria dropped heavy precipitation in New Jersey , peaking at 10 @.@ 29 in ( 261 mm ) in Little Falls . The rainfall led to record @-@ breaking river levels and flooding in several houses , resulting in damage to dozens of houses across the state . Moderate damage and rainfall continued along its path into New England and southeastern Canada . In all , Tropical Storm Doria caused seven deaths and $ 147 @.@ 6 million ( 1971 US $ , $ 862 million 2016 USD ) . 
 = = = Hurricane Fern = = = 
 Hurricane Fern was the first of four tropical systems to develop in association with an extended surface trough across the Gulf of Mexico into the open Atlantic , along with Ginger , Heidi , and a strong tropical depression . Fern developed on September 3 in the central Gulf of Mexico . It moved over southern Louisiana the next day , but due to increased ridging to the north the depression moved southwestward back over water . On September 7 , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Fern ; it is rare for a tropical depression to move over land in the continental United States ( excluding Florida ) and later attain tropical storm status . Fern later turned to the northwest , intensifying into a hurricane on September 8 . It quickly reached peak winds of 90 mph ( 140 km / h ) , but later weakened as it curved to the southwest , moving ashore on September 10 between Freeport and Matagorda , Texas as a tropical storm . Fern dissipated on September 13 over northeastern Mexico . 
 The precursor of Fern dropped rainfall up to 5 in ( 130 mm ) of rainfall across South Florida , while totals of up to 10 in ( 250 mm ) were reported in southeastern Louisiana where it made its first landfall . As it struck Texas , Fern produced strong winds up to 86 mph ( 138 km / h ) , along with 5 to 6 ft ( 1 @.@ 5 to 1 @.@ 8 m ) storm tides and heavy rainfall ; the highest precipitation total was 26 @.@ 0 in ( 660 mm ) in <unk> . The heavy rainfall caused severe flash flooding that isolated numerous small towns in the southeastern portion of the state , damaging 7 @,@ 500 buildings . In all , Fern left two indirect deaths and moderate damage totaling $ 30 @.@ 2 million ( 1971 USD , $ 171 million 2016 USD ) . 
 = = = Hurricane Edith = = = 
 Hurricane Edith , the strongest storm of the season , developed from a tropical wave on September 5 to the east of the southern Lesser Antilles . It moved quickly across the southern Caribbean Sea , intensifying into a hurricane just off the north coast of South America . Edith rapidly intensified on September 9 and made landfall on Cape Gracias a Dios as a Category 5 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson Hurricane Scale . It quickly lost intensity over Central America and after briefly entering the Gulf of Honduras it crossed the Yucatán Peninsula in Mexico . After moving across the Gulf of Mexico , a trough turned the storm to the northeast and Edith , after having restrengthened while accelerating towards the coast , made landfall on Louisiana with winds of 105 mph ( 170 km / h ) on September 16 . Edith steadily weakened over land and dissipated over Georgia on September 18 . 
 The hurricane killed two people when it passed near Aruba . Striking northeastern Central America as a Category 5 hurricane , Edith destroyed hundreds of homes and killed at least 35 people . In Texas high tides caused coastal flooding but little damage . Edith caused moderate to heavy damage in portions of Louisiana due to flooding and a tornado outbreak from the storm . One tornado , rated F3 on the Fujita Scale , damaged several homes and injured multiple people in Baton Rouge . The tornado outbreak extended eastward into Florida . Damage in the United States totaled $ 25 million ( 1971 USD , $ 146 million 2016 USD ) . 
 = = = Hurricane Ginger = = = 
 Hurricane Ginger was the longest lasting Atlantic hurricane on record until 2003 , when the 1899 San Ciriaco hurricane was retroactively found to have lasted longer . The eighth tropical cyclone and fifth hurricane of the season , Ginger spent 27 @.@ 25 days as a tropical cyclone , and lasted from September 6 to October 3 . The storm developed in a large region of convection across the Gulf of Mexico and western Atlantic , and for the first nine days of its duration tracked generally east- or northeastward while gradually strengthening to peak winds of 110 mph ( 175 km / h ) . On September 14 Ginger slowed and turned to a general westward track , passing near Bermuda on September 23 ; there , the hurricane produced gusty winds and high waves , but no damage . 
 While over the western Atlantic Ocean , Ginger became the last target of Project Stormfury , which sought to weaken hurricanes by depositing silver iodide into tropical cyclone rainbands . The plane dropped silver iodide into the center of Ginger , although there was no effect due to Ginger 's large eye and diffuse nature ; Ginger was the last seeding done by the project . Ginger ultimately struck North Carolina on September 30 as a minimal hurricane , lashing the coastline with gusty winds that caused power outages across the region . Heavy rainfall flooded towns and left heavy crop damage , with 3 million bushels of corn and 1 million bushels of soybean lost . Damage in the state was estimated at $ 10 million ( 1971 USD , $ 58 @.@ 4 million 2016 USD ) . Further north , moderate rainfall and winds spread through the Mid @-@ Atlantic states , although no significant damage was reported outside of North Carolina . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Heidi = = = 
 Tropical Storm Heidi was the last of the four tropical systems to develop from the extended surface trough of low pressure , forming on September 11 northeast of the Bahamas and intensifying into a tropical storm the next day . After initially moving to the northwest , Heidi curved northeastward and attained its peak intensity of 65 mph ( 100 km / h ) on September 14 off the coast of Virginia . The storm failed to become a well @-@ organized system , and it gradually weakened while accelerating north @-@ northeastward . On September 15 , shortly after Heidi moved ashore in Maine , it was absorbed by a broad extratropical cyclone over the northern Appalachians . 
 Heidi did not directly cause any fatalities or severe damage . However , the larger extratropical storm drew in moisture from Heidi , producing rainfall from North Carolina through northern New England , including a peak of 9 @.@ 38 in ( 238 mm ) in southeastern Pennsylvania . The heavy rains triggered extensive flooding that caused over a dozen fatalities and left thousands of residents homeless in Pennsylvania and New Jersey . In Chester , Pennsylvania a stone dam collapsed , forcing hundreds of families to evacuate and damaging homes , businesses , roads , and bridges . Governor Milton Shapp declared a state of emergency in several Pennsylvania counties following the floods . 
 = = = Hurricane Irene = = = 
 A tropical wave spawned a tropical depression on September 11 about 800 mi ( 1300 km ) east of the Windward Islands . The cyclone tracked nearly due westward at a low latitude , passing through the southern Windward Islands and later over northern South America . In the southwest Caribbean Sea , it intensified to a tropical storm and later a hurricane . Irene made landfall on southeastern Nicaragua on September 19 , and maintained its circulation as it crossed the low @-@ lying terrain of the country . <unk> after reaching the Pacific , Irene was renamed Hurricane Olivia , which ultimately attained peak winds of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) before weakening and dissipating over northwestern Mexico . 
 In the Atlantic , Irene produced moderate rainfall and winds along its path , although impact was greatest in Nicaragua where it moved ashore as a hurricane . A total of 96 homes were destroyed , and 1 @,@ 200 people were left homeless . The rainfall resulted in widespread flooding , killing three people in Rivas . In neighboring Costa Rica , Hurricane Irene caused more than $ 1 million ( 1971 USD , $ 5 @.@ 84 million 2016 USD ) in damage to the banana crop . The hurricane was the first actively tracked tropical cyclone that moved into the eastern Pacific Ocean from the Atlantic ocean . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Janice = = = 
 The origins of Janice were from a tropical wave that moved off the coast of Africa on September 18 . It developed into a tropical depression on September 21 about 1050 mi ( 1700 km ) west @-@ southwest of Cape Verde , which was the easternmost formation of the named storms this season . The next day , the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Janice , and quickly reached peak winds of 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) . The storm never became well @-@ organized , with its peak winds located east of the broad center . Despite being in a climatologically favored region for further development , Janice weakened due to increased wind shear from Hurricane Ginger . The circulation became elongated and separated from the convection , and on September 24 the storm weakened to a tropical depression . Later that day Janice dissipated just northeast of the Lesser Antilles as it was absorbed by Ginger . Around that time , it produced rainfall in the northeastern Caribbean , reaching 4 in ( 100 mm ) on Saint Kitts ; no damage or fatalities were reported . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Kristy = = = 
 The interaction between a tropical wave and an upper @-@ level trough led to the development of a tropical depression on October 18 , about 685 mi ( 1100 km ) northeast of Puerto Rico . It moved quickly north @-@ northeastward , followed by a curve to the northeast . On October 20 , a ship reported winds of 45 mph ( 72 km / h ) , indicating the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Kristy . As it reached this strength , an approaching cold front produced cooler , drier air over the storm . Kristy intensified slightly further to peak winds of 50 mph ( 85 km / h ) before becoming indistinguishable from the cold front . By October 21 it transitioned into an extratropical cyclone before dissipating near the Azores . 
 = = = Tropical Storm Laura = = = 
 The final storm of the season , Laura , formed on November 12 in the western Caribbean Sea , and reached winds of 70 mph ( 120 km / h ) as it approached western Cuba . Across the island , the storm produced heavy rainfall , peaking at 32 @.@ 5 in ( 830 mm ) . The resulting flooding killed one person and caused crop damage , and also forced 26 @,@ 000 people to evacuate their homes . Initially , Laura was forecast to move across the island and impact the southern United States , but it executed a small loop and turned to the southwest . The storm moved ashore on Belize , one of only four November storms to affect the country . Little impact occurred during Laura 's final landfall , and it dissipated on November 22 over central Guatemala . Laura had the second highest accumulated cyclone energy ( ACE ) of any Atlantic tropical cyclone that did not attain hurricane status behind a tropical storm in 1913 . 
 = = = Other storms = = = 
 In addition to the named storms and otherwise notable cyclones , there were several weak depressions during the season . After a June devoid of activity , three tropical depressions developed within the first ten days of July . The first became Tropical Storm Arlene on July 4 , and the second formed off the coast of Louisiana on July 6 . Tropical Depression Two moved westward due to a ridge to its northeast , and it struck just west of the Texas / Louisiana border before dissipating on July 8 . Its precursor dropped 3 @.@ 90 in ( 99 mm ) near Carrabelle , Florida , but much less along its path . Just two days later , another tropical depression formed in the northwestern Gulf of Mexico , quickly moving ashore in southern Texas before dissipating on July 11 ; it dropped light rainfall along its path . 
 In August , there were two tropical depressions , in addition to the named storms and the notable Tropical Depression Eight . The first , Tropical Depression Five , developed in the central Gulf of Mexico on August 6 . It made landfall in Louisiana three days later , eventually dissipating over Mississippi . The other , designated Tropical Depression Eleven , formed over the Bahamas on August 28 . It moved westward , crossing Florida and the Gulf of Mexico before dissipating over southeastern Louisiana on September 1 . The depression dropped moderate rainfall along the Gulf Coast , peaking at 6 @.@ 82 in ( 173 mm ) at Gulf Shores , Alabama . 
 There were three non @-@ developing tropical depressions in September , the first of which just off the coast of Africa on September 3 . It moved west @-@ northwestward , passing near Cape Verde before dissipating on September 8 . The next , Tropical Depression Eighteen , originated on September 8 east of Florida from the same trough that also spawned Fern , Ginger , and Heidi . It initially moved northward before curving to the west , making landfall near the Georgia / South Carolina border on September 11 before dissipating the following day . The other , Tropical Depression Nineteen , developed off the coast of Africa on September 10 , moving westward before dissipating on September 14 . 
 The final non @-@ developing tropical depression of the season formed on October 6 in the western Caribbean Sea . It crossed the Yucatán Peninsula the next day , dropping heavy rainfall up to 9 @.@ 09 in ( 231 mm ) . The depression turned to the northeast due to an approaching upper @-@ level trough , and it transitioned into an frontal wave on October 10 . As the trough advanced ahead of the storm , a ridge built across the southeast United States , causing the cyclone to turn northward and parallel the west coast of Florida . It regained tropical characteristics before moving ashore near Apalachicola and dissipating on October 14 . 
 = = Storm names = = 
 The following names were used for named storms ( tropical storms and hurricanes ) that formed in the North Atlantic in 1971 . Names that were not assigned are marked in gray . Storms were named Beth , Kristy and Laura for the first time in 1971 . No names were retired after the 1971 season . 
 = Jesús Blancornelas = 
 J. Jesús Blancornelas ( November 14 , 1936 – November 23 , 2006 ) was a Mexican journalist who co @-@ founded the Tijuana @-@ based Zeta magazine , known for its reporting on corruption and drug trafficking . His work encompassed an extensive research on how the drug industry influences local leaders and the police in the Mexican state of Baja California – topics frequently avoided by the rest of the Mexican media . 
 As an author of six books , Blancornelas was regarded by the press as a leading expert on organized crime and drug trafficking during his time . He was also the first man to publish a photograph of Ramón Arellano Félix , the former drug lord of the Tijuana Cartel . In response to the photo publication , the cartel attempted to kill Blancornelas in 1997 , but he managed to survive the attack and continued to report on the workings of Mexico 's criminal underworld . 
 For more than two decades , Blancornelas received several international press awards for his defiance of Mexico 's old regime status quo , where bribe @-@ taking and censorship by the government were commonplace in Mexico 's media . After his death , the Los Angeles Times and the Committee to Protect Journalists described him as " the spiritual godfather of modern Mexican journalism . " Blancornelas is also regarded as a pioneer in the push for press freedom in Mexico . 
 = = Early career = = 
 A native of San Luis Potosí , Blancornelas began his career as a journalist for El Sol de San Luis in April 1955 , working as a sportswriter . In 1960 , he moved to Tijuana , Baja California , where he became active in reporting on corruption and the drug trade . He was promoted to news editor at the daily newspaper El Mexicano before moving to the daily La Voz de la Frontera , of which he became editor @-@ in @-@ chief . Unlike several other journalists during his time , Blancornelas was eager to write about drug trafficking and corruption , leading to his firing from three newspapers before deciding to create his own . 
 In 1977 , he founded a newspaper called ABC . The paper employed future Zeta co @-@ founder Héctor Félix Miranda , then a columnist who wrote under " Félix el Gato " ( " Felix the Cat " ) to criticize local politicians . These columns eventually angered Baja California 's state government and Mexico 's former President José López Portillo to the point that the government ordered Blancornelas to fire Miranda and banned its distribution . When Blancornelas refused , a SWAT team was sent to take over the paper 's offices on the pretext of settling a labor dispute . Blancornelas escaped to the United States , resettling in San Diego , California . 
 = = Zeta = = 
 In 1980 , Blancornelas re @-@ surfaced with a new weekly publication known as Zeta , which he co @-@ founded with Félix . The magazine printed copies in the United States and then smuggled them across the border into Mexico . After some years , they reestablished themselves in Tijuana . Through the magazine , the pair continued their investigation into organized crime and corruption . The magazine ran a cover story in 1985 about local police guarding a marijuana @-@ filled warehouse ; the story was the first to report on the future leaders of the Tijuana Cartel , the Arellano Félix brothers . After Blancornelas discovered that plainclothes police officers had bought all 20 @,@ 000 copies of the issue , Zeta republished the issue under the headline " Censored ! " 
 Félix was killed by multiple shotgun blasts in 1988 ; two guards from the Agua Caliente Racetrack were later convicted of the murder . For the next eighteen years , Blancornelas left Félix 's name on the Zeta masthead , marked with a black cross . He also published a full @-@ page ad in every issue under Félix 's " byline " , asking the employer of the men , Tijuana politician Jorge Hank <unk> , why Félix had been murdered . 
 In 1994 , Zeta published an investigation on the assassination of Luis <unk> <unk> ; despite the conspiracy theories about the case , the magazine concluded that the shooting had been the work of a single troubled individual . 
 In the 2000s , Blancornelas wanted to remove <unk> from Zeta 's most dangerous stories , but was persuaded not to by reporter Francisco Ortiz , who wished his to continue to run atop his stories on organized crime . In 2005 , Ortiz was shot to death in front of his children , and Blancornelas began his no @-@ byline policy . In the days after Ortiz 's death , he stated , " I feel remorse for having created Zeta . After losing three colleagues , I believe the price has been too high . I would have liked to retire a long time ago ... [ but ] I cannot allow drug traffickers to think that they were able to crush Zeta 's spirit , and our readers to believe that we are afraid . " 
 Blancornelas covered the rise of Mexico 's drug trafficking organizations for more than thirty years , but his best work in the field took place during the 1990s . During this period , Mexico experienced the rise of three powerful drug cartels : the Tijuana Cartel in the west ; the Juárez Cartel in Ciudad Juárez ; and the Gulf Cartel in the east . Blancornelas ' stories are considered so crucial that almost every written account of the Tijuana Cartel cites him . 
 = = Assassination attempt = = 
 In November 1996 , Blancornelas was planning to visit New York City to receive an international award for his work in covering the drug trade , political corruption , and the relationship between the drug lords and the police . A few days before he was about to fly , a policeman in Tijuana visited Blancornelas and warned him that he was risking his life if he decided to go . A year later , the warning proved to be true : in 1997 in Tijuana , Blancornelas was ambushed and wounded by gunmen of the Tijuana Cartel while heading to the airport for publishing a photo of the drug lord Ramón Arellano Félix . Blancornelas was nearly killed when the attackers opened fire on his car , wounding him in the abdomen and killing his driver and bodyguard , Luis Valero Elizalde , who died protecting him and managed to kill one of the shooters . Blancornelas suffered complications from the injury for the rest of his life . In the attack , Blancornelas ' car was hit more than 180 times , but only four bullets penetrated the journalist 's body . Elizalde , however , was hit 38 times . That same year , three other prominent journalists were killed in Mexico . 
 The nature of Blancornelas ' work forced him to live under a " self @-@ imposed home arrest , " only traveling to his workplace and home with multiple Special Forces bodyguards from the Mexican Army , who accompanied him everywhere . While previous attacks on journalists received little coverage , Blancornelas ' assassination attempt made it to the <unk> of most newspapers in Mexico , and was covered on the television and radio . The attempt also fueled internationally ; the New York Times , Los Angeles Times , San Diego Union Tribune , and the National Public Radio covered it extensively . Due to the public outcry , the Mexican authorities decided to report the attack to the Office of the General Prosecutor , which had greater resources than the state authorities . 
 After spending 20 days in the hospital , Blancornelas recovered from his wounds and returned to publishing for the Zeta magazine . He left the hospital with a walker and was escorted by municipal , judicial state , and federal policemen , along with soldiers of the Mexican Army , to his home in La Mesa delegation in Tijuana . As he got to his home , a crowd of reports awaited Blancornelas , who allowed them to take pictures of him but refused to answer any questions . " I 'll be back as soon as possible , " Blancornelas said to the reporters as he entered his home . He also thanked the media for covering his assassination attempt . 
 The Blancornelas family erected a huge brick wall in their one @-@ story house to increase their security measures ; outside the house , a squadron of military men guarded the family , while some others protected the Zeta offices . As of 1998 , the top editors of the newspaper , along with Blancornelas ' three sons , were under guard by the authorities at all times . 
 Marco Arturo Quiñones Sánchez , whom Mexican authorities alleged to be a hit man for the Tijuana Cartel , was later charged with being one of the gunmen in the attack on Blancornelas , but was found not guilty by a judge in 2013 . 
 = = Death = = 
 In the last years of his life , Blancornelas lived as a virtual prisoner , always accompanied by an escort of fifteen armed guards . He died in the border city of Tijuana , Baja California on November 23 , 2006 in Del Prado Hospital , from complications caused by stomach cancer , possibly caused by the embedded bullets he received when he was shot . Blancornelas was taken to the hospital on November 19 after his son confessed that his father had a lung defect that dated back to his youth . Prior to his death , Blancornelas stopped reporting directly for the Zeta magazine since February 2006 but still sent information to the magazine , particularly on issues covering drug trafficking . Beginning to doubt Zeta 's ability to foster change , Blancornelas considered closing the magazine with his death . Editor Adela Navarro Bello and his son César René Blanco Villalón persuaded him to let the magazine continue , however , and succeeded him as the magazine 's co @-@ publishers . 
 Just before his death , Blancornelas speculated that the Tijuana Cartel had placed a US $ 250 @,@ 000 bounty on his assassination , and publicly said that he wanted to interview <unk> Arellano Félix , a female drug lord of the cartel , to confirm the information . 
 He was survived by his wife , <unk> Villalón de Blanco , and three sons : José Jesús , Ramón Tomás and César René . 
 While Blancornelas ' reporting helped bring some drug lords to justice , the Mexican drug trafficking organizations grew more powerful after his death . As he said in an interview shortly before dying : 
 = = Awards = = 
 In 1996 , he was one of four winners of the US @-@ based CPJ International Press Freedom Awards , which honor journalists who show courage in defending press freedom despite facing attacks , threats , or imprisonment .

 Pennsylvania Route 106 ( PA 106 ) is a 20 @.@ 69 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 33 @.@ 30 km ) state highway located in both Susquehanna and Lackawanna counties in Pennsylvania . Route 106 begins at a fork from U.S. Route 11 ( US 11 ) in the community of Kingsley . The route heads southeasterly for most of its length , interchanging with Interstate 81 ( I @-@ 81 ) in Lenox Township . PA 106 continues into the city of Carbondale , where the designation terminates at US 6 Business ( US 6 Bus . , North Main Street ) , the former alignment of US 6 through Carbondale . 
 PA 106 is one of five portions of the original U.S. Route 106 ( US 106 ) , a spur of US 6 through Pennsylvania . US 106 went from US 6 in Wyalusing to the New York state line in Damascus Township along current @-@ day PA 652 . The designation was eliminated in 1972 and replaced by PA 106 from Kingsley to Carbondale , PA 652 from Indian Orchard to Darbytown and PA 706 from Wyalusing to Nichols .

 PA 106 begins at an intersection with US 11 in the community of Kingsley , Pennsylvania . The route heads to the southeast , paralleling US 11 through forestry until the intersection with Jeffers Road , where it turns away from US 11 and enters fields . The route makes several curves to the southeast and east , crossing through several large fields and industries . The route keeps turning to the southeast , re @-@ entering the deep woods and passing a large pond near West Lenox . In West Lenox , PA 106 passes through forestry and residences until leaving the community for more forestry . After paralleling Creek Road for a distance , PA 106 enters the small community of Lenox , where the highway intersects PA 92 near some industry . A short distance later , the highway interchanges with I @-@ 81 at Interchange 211 . After I @-@ 81 , PA 106 continues paralleling the interstate through forestry . The highway continues eastward , paralleling Stone Road into East Lenox , Pennsylvania . 
 After crossing from East Lenox , PA 106 continues southeastward through fields and soon into a region of residences . The southeastern stretch continues for several miles into the community of West Clifford . There , PA 106 passes some homes and intersects with PA 374 . The two designations become concurrent , paralleling the alignment of the Milford and Owego Turnpike Road through West Clifford . PA 106 and PA 374 head southward and soon turn southwestward through forestry , until clearing into the community of Royal . In the small community , PA 106 and PA 374 fork , with PA 374 heading southwestward to Glenwood and PA 106 heading southeastward through Royal . PA 106 continues further , entering deep woods once again after leaving Royal . At the intersection with Cemetery Road , the highway enters a large cemetery and into Clifford . There , the route crosses through a large residential and commercial community , intersecting with State Route 2008 ( SR 2008 ) . The route continues southeastward through the residential area before crossing the county line into Lackawanna County .

 After crossing into Lackawanna County , PA 106 continues on a southeastern trend , crossing through homes before returning to the deep forestry in Greenfield Township . The route continues further , passing through a lumber yard , where it turns southward and further southeastward into the community of Finch Hill . In Finch Hill , PA 106 passes Our Mother of Sorrows Cemetery and intersects with PA 247 ( Lakeland Drive ) in the center of the town . After PA 247 , PA 106 passes through a small residential district before reaching the Homestead Golf Course . The route passes along the southern side of the golf course and turns eastward after passing to the north of <unk> @-@ <unk> Park . 
 After leaving the golf course behind , PA 106 makes a gradual turn to the southeast at Crystal Lake Road . There , the highway becomes known as Fall Brook Road , and turns southward through forestry . At the intersection with 43rd Street , PA 106 enters the city of Carbondale . The route , known now as Fallbrook Street , continues on a southeastern trend , entering a large residential district north of the business district . At the intersection with <unk> Street , it turns southward again , paralleling a nearby river . At the intersection with River Street , PA 106 turns eastward along Salem Avenue , crosses the river and intersects with US 6 Bus . ( North Main Street ) in Carbondale . At that intersection , the PA 106 designation terminates while Salem Avenue continues as SR 1019 through Carbondale . 
 = = History = = 
 PA 106 was originally an alignment of PA 47 designated in 1927 . This alignment stretched from US 11 in Kingsley to the intersection with US 6 in Carbondale . In the plan for the U.S. Highway System from November 11 , 1926 , the road between Wyalusing and Carbondale was to be a part of US 6 while US 106 was to run from US 6 in Wyalusing to the New York border at the Delaware River in Narrowsburg via Scranton . By 1928 , US 6 and US 106 switched alignments between Wyalusing and Carbondale . The piece of US 106 that is now PA 106 began in the community of Kingsley and went to the city of Carbondale . The route remained intact for almost 45 years . On December 3 , 1971 , the American Association of State Highway Officials approved the elimination of the US 106 designation . On March 14 , 1972 , US 106 was decommissioned and replaced with PA 706 between US 6 in Wyalusing and US 11 south of New Milford , PA 106 between US 11 in Kingsley and US 6 in Carbondale , and PA 652 between US 6 in Indian Orchard and the Delaware River . The remainder of the route was removed from concurrencies with US 11 between south of New Milford and Kingsley and US 6 between Carbondale and Indian Orchard . Signs were changed by April of that year .

 = Day of Thirst = 
 The " Day of Thirst " ( Arabic : <unk> al- ' Atash ) is the name traditionally given in Arabic historiography to a battle fought in 724 between the Turkic Turgesh khaganate and the Umayyad Caliphate on the banks of the river Jaxartes , in Transoxiana ( in modern Tajikistan , Central Asia ) . The Umayyad army , under Muslim ibn Sa 'id al @-@ Kilabi , was campaigning in the Ferghana Valley when it learned of the Turgesh advance . Immediately , the Arabs began a hasty retreat to the Jaxartes , pursued and harassed by the Turgesh cavalry . Finally , after 11 days , the Umayyad army reached the Jaxartes , where it was caught between the Turgesh and the forces of the native Transoxianian principalities . Nevertheless , the Arabs managed to break through and cross the river to Khujand . The Umayyad defeat led to the collapse of Muslim rule over much of the region , which until ca . 740 remained disputed territory , with both the Arabs and the Turgesh fighting for control over it . 
 = = Background = = 
 The region of Transoxiana ( Arabic : Ma wara ' al @-@ nahr ) had been conquered by the Umayyad leader Qutayba ibn Muslim in the reign of Al @-@ Walid I ( r . 705 – 715 ) , following the Muslim conquests of Persia and Khurasan in the mid @-@ 7th century . The loyalties of Transoxiana 's native Iranian and Turkic populations and those of autonomous local rulers remained questionable , however , as demonstrated in 719 , when the Transoxianian princes sent a petition to the Chinese and their Turgesh vassals for military aid against the Caliphate 's governors . The Turgesh responded by launching a series of attacks against the Muslims in Transoxiana , beginning in 720 . These incursions were coupled with uprisings against the Caliphate among the local Sogdians . The Umayyad governor of Khurasan , Sa 'id ibn Amr al @-@ Harashi , harshly suppressed the unrest and restored the Muslim position almost to what it had been during the time of Qutayba , except for the Ferghana Valley , control over which was lost . 
 = = Expedition against Ferghana and the " Day of Thirst " = = 
 In 723 , al @-@ Harashi was replaced as governor by Muslim ibn Sa 'id al @-@ Kilabi , who resolved late the next year to launch an expedition with the goal of seizing Ferghana . The campaign faced difficulties already in its early stages , when the news arrived of the accession of a new Caliph , Hisham ibn Abd al @-@ Malik , and the appointment of a new governor of Iraq , Khalid al @-@ Qasri . Expecting Muslim 's imminent recall by the new regime , the Yemeni troops in Balkh initially refused to join the campaign , but were forced to join the army when a force composed of Mudaris ( northern Arabs ) under Nasr ibn Sayyar marched against them and defeated them at <unk> . The campaign eventually went ahead as Khalid al @-@ Qasri wrote to al @-@ Kilabi , urging him to proceed with it until his replacement , Khalid 's brother Asad , arrived in Khurasan . Nevertheless , 4 @,@ 000 troops from the Yemeni Azd tribe withdrew from the army . 
 Al @-@ Kilabi led his army along the Jaxartes valley to Ferghana , and laid siege to it while devastating the surrounding countryside . At this point , the Umayyad army became aware that the Turgesh khagan Suluk was advancing against them with a stronger army . Abandoning their advance , the Muslim army retreated so hastily towards the south that it was claimed they covered a distance in one day that equalled three days of normal travel . On the second day , after the Arabs crossed the river Wadi al @-@ <unk> , the Turgesh army caught up with them , and attacked a secondary camp pitched by Abdallah ibn Abi Abdallah separately from the main Arab force . The Arabs and their Sogdian allies suffered heavy casualties — the brother of the ruler of Samarkand , Ghurak , being among the slain — but managed to repel the attack . 
 The Arabs continued their retreat for eight more days , during which they were constantly harassed by the Turgesh cavalry . On the ninth day , the Arabs reached the Jaxartes only to find their path blocked by their enemies , troops of the native principalities of Shash and Farghana , and the remnants of the Sogdian rebellion Sa 'id al @-@ Harashi had suppressed . The Arabs made camp for the night and burned all their baggage , allegedly worth one million dirhams , in preparation for battle . On the next day , despite suffering from thirst and being hemmed in between the Turgesh on their rear and the Transoxianian forces in front , the desperate Arabs managed to break through the enemy lines and cross the Jaxartes . As al @-@ Tabari writes , when they reached the relative safety of Khujand , " suffering from hunger and exhaustion , the troops spread out in disorder " . There , the leadership of the army was formally transferred to Abd al @-@ Rahman ibn Na 'im al @-@ <unk> , who led the remnants of the army back to Samarkand . 
 = = Aftermath and impact = = 
 The defeat of the Arab army , and the casualties suffered , was a catalyst for the almost complete collapse of Muslim rule in Transoxiana over the next few years . In the words of the British scholar H.A.R. Gibb , " it was practically the last aggressive expedition of the Arabs into Transoxania for fifteen years , but of much greater importance was the blow which it struck at Arab prestige . The roles were reversed ; from now onwards the Arabs found themselves on the defensive and were gradually ousted from almost every district across the Oxus . " The new Umayyad governor , Asad al @-@ Qasri , campaigned incessantly over the next few years , but without achieving any major result . Asad also tried to secure the cooperation of the local elites by abolishing for a time the payment of taxes by the native converts ( mawali ) , but this policy was opposed by the Khurasani Arabs themselves , and was reversed by Asad 's successor Ashras ibn Abdallah al @-@ Sulami . This led to a general uprising of Transoxiana in 728 , and with Turgesh military aid the Arabs were evicted from almost the entire region . Transoxiana thereafter remained contested , and the Arabs did not recover their previous position until the campaigns of Nasr ibn Sayyar in 739 – 741 , who took advantage of the collapse of the Turgesh khaganate into civil wars after the murder of Suluk in 738 . 
 = Louis H. Carpenter = 
 Louis Henry Carpenter ( February 11 , 1839 – January 21 , 1916 ) was a United States Army brigadier general and a recipient of the Medal of Honor for his actions in the American Indian Wars . 
 He dropped out of college to enlist in the Union Army at the beginning of the American Civil War in 1861 , first as an enlisted soldier before being commissioned as an officer the following year . During the American Civil War , he participated in at least fourteen campaigns primarily with the 6th U.S. Cavalry Regiment and as regimental commander of the 5th U.S. Colored Cavalry Regiment . By the end of the Civil War , he held the rank of brevet lieutenant colonel , colonel of volunteers and also received a commission to first lieutenant in the Regular United States Army . 
 Carpenter received the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Indian Wars while serving with the Buffalo Soldiers of the 10th U.S. Cavalry . He was noted several times for gallantry in official dispatches . 
 After the Civil War and until his transfer back East in 1887 , he served primarily on the western frontier . He engaged many Native American tribes , dealt with many types of renegades and explored vast areas of uncharted territory from Texas to Arizona . During the Spanish – American War , he commanded an occupation force and became the first military governor of Puerto Principe , Cuba . After 38 continuous years of service to his country , he retired from the Army on October 19 , 1899 , as a brigadier general . After his retirement , he became a speaker and a writer . 
 = = Early life and family = = 
 Louis H. Carpenter was a direct descendant ( great @-@ great @-@ great @-@ grandson ) of the notable immigrant Samuel Carpenter ( November 4 , 1649 Horsham , Sussex , England – April 10 , 1714 Philadelphia , Pennsylvania ) , who came to America in early 1683 by way of Barbados . 
 The eldest son of eight children born to Edward Carpenter 2nd and Anna Maria ( Mary ) Howey , Carpenter was born in Glassboro , New Jersey . In 1843 , his family moved to Philadelphia where they attended Trinity Episcopal Church in West Philadelphia . L. Henry Carpenter attended A. B. Central High School in Philadelphia in 1856 and started attending Student University of Pennsylvania in 1859 . 
 His younger brother , James Edward Carpenter , served in the Union army as a private in the Eighth Pennsylvania Cavalry and later was commissioned a second lieutenant . He later became a first lieutenant , captain then a brevet major of volunteers .

 In July 1861 , during his junior year , Carpenter dropped out of Dickinson College and joined the " The Fighting Sixth " Cavalry Regiment . He became a private in the Union Army which later became known as the Army of the Potomac . Carpenter was trained as an infantry soldier who was capable of riding a horse to the battlefield and as a mounted scout . As a " horse soldier " , Carpenter and others like him had a steep learning curve that proved difficult and frustrating during the first year of the conflict . He participated in the Peninsula Campaign and chased the audacious Jeb Stuart 's Cavalry that went completely around the Union Army ( June 13 – 15 , 1862 ) . This caused great psychological concerns to the Union cavalry commanders and men . The " horse soldiers " were a far second best compared to the dashing Confederate cavalry . 
 Rapid expansion of the Union Cavalry in the East was chaotic . At the beginning of the Civil War , officers were elected by the men or appointed politically . This resulted in many misguided and inept commanders . The tools and techniques of pre @-@ war cavalry often seemed inadequate , resulting in a steep learning curve that was costly in men and supplies . Slowly out the chaos came the tactics and leaders who proved worthy of the challenge . Union " horse soldiers " became cavalry troopers under this tough regimen and proved adept , dismounted and mounted on horseback , with their carbines , pistols , sabers and confident under their battle @-@ proven leaders . 
 After the Seven Days Battles ( June 25 to July 1 , 1862 ) , Carpenter was commissioned a second lieutenant in the Regular Army , 6th U. S. Cavalry , on July 17 , 1862 , for meritorious actions and leadership . 
 = = = = Gettysburg Campaign = = = = 
 The Gettysburg Campaign was a series of engagements before and after the Battle of Gettysburg . To better understand Carpenter 's role within the military organization , the following brief is provided . For more details , see Gettysburg Union order of battle . 
 The Army of the Potomac was initially under Major General Joseph Hooker then under Major General George G. Meade on June 28 , 1863 . 
 The Cavalry Corps was commanded by Major General Alfred Pleasonton , with divisions commanded by Brigadier Generals John Buford , David McM . Gregg , and H. Judson Kilpatrick . 
 The following list is the 6th US Cavalry Regiment 's documented battles and engagements of June and July 1863 which Carpenter participated . These battle were pivotal for Carpenter . He was a company commander until July 3 then acting executive officer of his regiment after that . 
 Beverly Ford , Virginia , June 9 , at the Battle of Brandy Station . The 6th was under Buford 's right wing .

 On June 9 , 1863 , opposing cavalry forces met at Brandy Station , near Culpeper , Virginia . The 9 @,@ 500 Confederate cavalrymen under Major General J.E.B. Stuart were surprised at dawn by Major General Alfred Pleasonton 's combined arms force of two cavalry divisions of some 8 @,@ 000 cavalry troops ( including the 6th U.S. Cavalry Regiment and Carpenter with his Company H ) and 3 @,@ 000 infantry . Stuart barely repulsed the Union attack and required more time to reorganize and rearm . This inconclusive battle was the largest predominantly cavalry engagement of the Civil War to that time . This battle proved for the first time that the Union horse soldiers , like Carpenter , were equal to their Southern counterparts . 
 = = = = = Battle of Fairfield = = = = = 
 On July 3 , 1863 , reports of a slow moving Confederate wagon train in the vicinity of Fairfield , Pennsylvania , attracted the attention of newly commissioned Union Brigadier General Wesley Merritt of the Reserve Brigade , First Division , Cavalry Corps . He ordered the 6th U.S. Cavalry under Major Samuel H. Starr to scout Fairfield and locate the wagons , resulting in the Battle of Fairfield . 
 Carpenter 's next action was with Major Starr on July 3 , 1863 . Starr had his 400 troopers dismount in a field and an orchard on both sides of the road near Fairfield . Union troopers directed by their officers took up hasty defensive positions on this slight ridge . Carpenter 's troops and others threw back a mounted charge of the 7th Virginia Cavalry , just as the Confederate Chew 's Battery <unk> and opened fire on the Federal cavalrymen . Supported by the 6th Virginia Cavalry , the 7th Virginia charged again , clearing Starr 's force off the ridge and inflicting heavy losses . General " Grumble " Jones , outnumbering the Union forces by more than 2 to 1 , pursued the retreating Federals for three miles to the Fairfield Gap , but was unable to eliminate his quarry . Major Starr who was wounded in the first attack was unable to escape and was captured . Small groups of the 6th Cavalry , " ... reformed several miles from the field of action by Lt. Louis H. Carpenter , " harassed the Virginia troopers giving the impression of the vanguard of a much larger force . Carpenter became then became the acting executive officer of the Regiment . 
 Carpenter , in this fight with others of his small regiment at Fairfield , stood against two of the crack brigades of Stuart 's cavalry . The 6th Cavalry 's stand was considered one of the most gallant in its history and helped influence the outcome the battles being fought around Gettysburg . While the 6th Cavalry regiment was cut to pieces , it fought so well that its squadrons were regarded as the advance of a large body of troops . The senior officer of those brigades was later criticized severely for being delayed by such an inferior force . Had the 6th Cavalry regiment not made their stand , the two brigades of Virginians could have caused serious problems to the Union rear areas . 
 Lieutenant Carpenter , of Troop H , was one of only three officers of the 6th U.S. Cavalry to escape from the deadly melee at Fairfield on July 3 , 1863 . Private George Crawford Platt , later Sergeant , an Irish immigrant serving in Carpenter 's Troop H , received the Medal of Honor on July 12 , 1895 , for his actions that day at Fairfield . His citation reads , " Seized the regimental flag upon the death of the standard bearer in a hand @-@ to @-@ hand fight and prevented it from falling into the hands of the enemy . " His " commander " , as an eyewitness , documented Private Platt 's " beyond the call of duty " behavior that day . Carpenter was brevetted from second lieutenant to first lieutenant for his gallant and meritorious conduct for his actions at Fairfield . During this time period , he was mentioned in official reports and dispatches . 
 = = = = Overland Campaign = = = = 
 On April 5 , 1864 , Major General Philip Sheridan was appointed to command the Cavalry Corps of the Army of the Potomac under the newly promoted general @-@ in @-@ chief Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant . Carpenter became his Aide @-@ de @-@ camp similar to today 's executive assistant known then as a Field & Staff ( F & S ) officer to the Cavalry Corps . It is unknown how much of an influence Carpenter had on Sheridan on the concept of deploying Union cavalry to become more effective and independent in roles such as long @-@ range raids . Carpenter 's treatise on " The Battle of Yellow Tavern " suggests that he had some influence on what was later called the Richmond or Sheridan 's Raid . 
 On May 8 , 1864 , at the beginning of the Overland Campaign , Sheridan went over his immediate superior , Major General Meade 's head and told Grant that if his Cavalry Corps were let loose to operate as an independent unit , he could defeat Confederate Major General J.E.B. Stuart . " Jeb " Stuart was the most prominent and able cavalry officer of the south . Grant was intrigued and convinced Meade of the value of Sheridan 's request . 
 The May 1864 Battle of Yellow Tavern was the first of four major so called strategic raids . The others being the <unk> in June 1864 , the Wilson @-@ <unk> in late June , and the First Deep Bottom in July 1864 . Of all of these , only the Battle of Yellow Tavern can be considered a clear Union victory . The defeat and resulting death of " Jeb " Stuart made this clear during the first raid . At best , the follow @-@ up raids diverted Confederate forces required to deal with them from where they were needed elsewhere . Despite what Carpenter and other supporters of Sheridan have written , further raids of this caliber were less than successful . And these raids may have even hindered the Union effort by the lack of reconnaissance and intelligence Sheridan could have otherwise provided . How long Carpenter served with Sheridan is not currently known . Carpenter is not mentioned in Sheridan 's personal memoirs or other major books on Sheridan . Brevet Lieutenant Colonel Carpenter was promoted to first lieutenant in the Regular Army on September 28 , 1864 . He was then transferred the District of Kentucky , Department of Ohio and accepted a commission to lieutenant colonel of volunteers with the United States colored Troops . 
 = = = = 5th U.S. Colored Cavalry = = = = 
 Lieutenant Colonel of Volunteers L. Henry Carpenter arrived at Camp Nelson , Kentucky on October 1 , 1864 . The majority of 600 " colored " slaves , ex @-@ slaves and freedmen of what would become the 5th United States Colored Cavalry ( USCC ) were absent . The men were then in the field being led by Lieutenant Colonel James S. Brisbin under Brevet Major General Stephen G. Burbridge preparing for an attack on Saltville , Virginia . The 5th USCC would not be officially organized until October 24 , 1864 . 
 = = = = = First Battle of Saltville = = = = = 
 In late September 1864 , Burbridge led a raid into southwest Virginia against the salt works near the town of Saltville , Virginia as part of the Battle of Saltville on October 1 , 1864 . Burbridge controversially led white troops and some 600 mostly untrained black troops into that battle and , despite outstanding effort by the " coloured troops , " the raid ultimately failed . Burbridge quickly retreated the next day . Wounded troops ( black and white ) were left behind on the field of battle . By October 3 , an unknown number of surrendered and wounded Union soldiers were killed by Confederate regular , home guard and irregular soldiers , with special ire directed toward the black troops . To many this was a war crime and Champ Ferguson , a captain of partisan rangers , was later found guilty of murdering 53 white and black soldiers at the Battle of Saltville , and on October 20 , 1865 , he was hanged until dead . Ferguson and Henry <unk> were the only two Confederate soldiers during the Civil War tried for war crimes . 
 Union forces en route back to Camp Nelson had a brief engagement on October 21 , 1864 at Harrodsburg , Kentucky . A few days later , Carpenter faced the defeated but defiant Union troops as they returned to Camp Nelson in October . The reports of " Black Flag " behavior toward the " colored troops " and their white officers frightened many men . And it was widely reported in the press both North and South . 
 = = = = = Problems = = = = = 
 Carpenter became the executive officer of the 5th USCC in charge of training and getting the African @-@ American recruits ready for combat . Basic drill , weapon training and conditioning helped build confidence and preparedness . Carpenter faced another serious problem . Non @-@ commissioned officers were to be chosen from the ranks and with almost an entire regiment of recent ex @-@ slaves , Carpenter found it difficult to find men literate enough to handle the tasks assigned to sergeants . " Scarcely any of the Colored men enlisted into this regiment can read or write , " wrote Carpenter , to Captain O. Bates Dickson in a letter . 
 Carpenter 's solution , which was granted by his superiors , involved placing literate white non @-@ commissioned officers among the " colored sergeants . " This combined with a literacy program for African @-@ American NCOs corrected the problem in time . 
 Another problem was the rifles issued to the 5th USCC . These were muzzle loaded Enfield infantry rifles unsuited for mounted use because they could not be loaded on horseback . Carpenter taught tactics that involved dismounted fighting , going back to the concept of " mounted infantry " who dismounted to fight . 
 A final problem was white officers promoted from the ranks who were " unsuited " to command " colored troops . " Despite efforts of training by Carpenter and others , attrition was the only real solution for these junior officers . 
 = = = = = Stoneman ’ s 1864 Winter Raid = = = = = 
 In December 1864 , General George Stoneman ordered the 5th USCC to participate in a raid from East Tennessee into southwestern Virginia . This resulted in engagements that involved the 5th USCC at Hopkinsville , Kentucky on December 12 , Kingsport , Tennessee on December 13 , the Battle of Marion near Marion , Virginia on December 17 & 18 , and the second Battle of Saltville on December 20 & 21 near Saltville , Virginia . All were considered Union victories . 
 During the Battle of Marion , Division Commander Stephen G. Burbridge ordered the 5th USCC between two white units on the left flank of the Union line . Lieutenant Colonel James S. Brisbin and his second in command , Carpenter , led their dismounted soldiers forward toward the Confederate defensive works . The Confederates opened heavy fire upon the advancing Union troops that included four ten pound Parrott rifled cannons . The first Union charge wavered and fell back . Carpenter was seen giving clear orders to reform and rallied his men . With a mighty yell the 5th USCC rushed forward toward the breastworks but could not break the defensive line . Carpenter ordered the men to dig in and night fell . Volunteers went out between lines to rescue the wounded . 
 On December 18 , the morning was cold and rainy with a light fog . The second day began as a copy of the first with multiple Union charges . The Union center was able to breach the center of the Confederate <unk> but were pushed out by a Rebel counterattack . Carpenter led a mounted rescue force of colored soldiers to save white soldiers trapped near a cover bridge on the left flank . Carpenter made several attempts but could not rescue the soldiers . Most of those trapped soldiers would be captured later that afternoon , but released before giving their parole . Later that day the Confederate reinforcements delivered a wild rebel yelling charge on the Union left flank . The white unit adjacent to the 5th USCC was completely routed and the 5th USCC flank was threatened . Ordered to fall back , Carpenter and Brisbin tried to maintain an orderly retreat . Many " colored soldiers " remembering the murder of their comrades during the first battle of Saltville broke ranks to rescue their wounded comrades . The retreat threatened to become a rout . About 4 PM , Union reinforcements arrived and bolstered the Union line . During the night , Confederate forces were forced to retire due to the lack of ammunition . The next day Union forces buried the dead and helped the wounded . The costly victory marked the highpoint of Stoneman 's raid . 
 On the afternoon of December 20 , Union forces attacked Saltville , Virginia . Confederate forces were overwhelmed when the 5th & 6th USCC entered the fray with a cold vengeance . Outnumbered Confederate forces retreated and awaited promised reinforcements . Union forces hastily attempted to destroy the vital salt works . They destroyed about one third of the boiling kettles and most evaporating sheds . They also damaged portions of the Virginia & Tennessee railroad . But they failed to destroy or damage the actual salt wells . General Stoneman claimed a victory and retreated out of Virginia before Confederate forces could completely surround him . Carpenter 's role is strangely missing from letters and other documents that simply note that he was there . Within three months , the saltworks were back in full production . Carpenter later wrote a long letter home about this battle and how his men responded . 
 = = = = = Ambush at Simpsonville = = = = = 
 On January 23 , 1865 , 80 " colored " troops of Company E , 5th US Colored Cavalry , under command of 2nd Lieutenant Augustus Flint , were assigned to move almost a thousand head of cattle from Camp Nelson to the stock yard at Louisville , Kentucky . The men were mostly assigned to the front and rear of the spread out herd of cattle . About 41 men were bringing up the rear on January 25 near Simpsonville , when they were ambushed by Confederate guerrillas . Very few of the Union troops were able to fire their muzzle @-@ loaded Enfield infantry rifles , due to fouled powder . The guerrillas were armed with 6 @-@ shot revolvers , and most carried two or more . As Confederates quickly closed the distance , almost all of the " colored soldiers " bringing up the rear were wounded or dismounted . Only two escaped harm , one by playing dead , and the other hiding under an overturned wagon box . The forward group panicked and fled . 
 About an hour after the ambush , local citizens found 15 dead and 20 wounded soldiers stretched out on and near the road . Four more soldiers were later found dead of wounds or of exposure nearby . The men of Simpsonville took 20 wounded men back to town , 8 of the men so severely wounded they were not expected to live . A total of six soldiers died en route or in Louisville . Later it was determined that 19 Union soldiers had been murdered trying to surrender or after being disarmed . The remainder of the Union wounded were left to die in the freezing cold . Three soldiers remained missing in the final accounting . Flint , who was in town during the ambush , fled to Louisville . Authorities telegraphed Camp Nelson , and Carpenter immediately ordered ambulances , and a heavy escort was mounted . They arrived on scene on October 28 and took the surviving wounded to a hospital in Louisville . Locals reported what had happened and the boasts of the Confederate guerrillas , led by Captain Dick Taylor , who had murdered or shot many of the Union soldiers after they had been captured . The mass grave was located , and an effort was made to find the missing men . Carpenter wrote a report and documented the names of the known guerrillas and encouraged a hunt and their prosecution .

 In mid February 1865 , Colonel James F. Wade regimental commander of the 6th USCC was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers and moved to Division duties . A reorganization of command of 5th & 6th USCC resulted . Brevet Lieutenant Colonel James S. Brisbin of the 5th USCC took over the 6th USCC and Carpenter took command of the 5th USCC Regiment . The 5th USCC regiment was attached to the 1st Division , District of Kentucky , Department of Ohio until February 1865 . The regiment subsequently served under the Military District of Kentucky until December 1865 and the Department of Arkansas until March 20 , 1866 . During this later period of time the regiment performed scattered garrison duties and reportedly hunted rebel renegades .

 Through the course of the Civil War , Carpenter served in at least 14 campaigns and over 150 battles related to them from the 1861 Peninsula Campaign , the 1862 Maryland Campaign , Campaign at Fredericksburg , the 1863 Gettysburg Campaign , Chancellorsville ( in Stoneman ’ s raid to the rear of Lee ’ s army ) , the 1864 The Wilderness and final battles in Kentucky and south @-@ West Virginia .

 After the fighting stopped and Reconstruction began , Carpenter did not go with the 6th Cavalry to Texas in October 1865 , as reported in some historical sketches . Carpenter stayed in Arkansas with the 5th USCC until March 1866 . 
 There was little or no fighting during the state of martial law imposed while the military closely supervised local government , enrolled freemen to vote , excluded former Confederate leaders for a period of time , supervised free elections , and tried to protect office holders and freedmen from the Ku Klux Klan and early versions of the White League violence . Carpenter and his men did face a low level of civil hostility and violence during this uneasy transition period by trying to keep the peace . Many former rebels resented occupation by " colored " soldiers . Carpenter saw this ugly racism daily and did his best to maintain the peace . Carpenter was promoted colonel of volunteers on November 2 , 1865 .

 The 5th USCC Regimental Commander , Colonel of Volunteers , L. Henry Carpenter , had his final regimental review on March 16 , 1866 in Helena , Arkansas . The names of 46 officers and men still listed officially as missing in action and presumed murdered between October 2 & 8 , 1864 were read for a final time to the regiment . Then most of the officers , including Carpenter , were honorably discharged by ceremony . Over the next four days the men were mustered out and the regiment was officially retired on March 20 , 1866 . Official losses from October 24 , 1864 to March 16 , 1866 were 35 killed in action and 152 died in service from disease , wounds and other causes . After mustering out , Carpenter reverted to his Regular Army rank of first lieutenant and returned home to Philadelphia on leave . After his leave he reported to the new 10th United States Cavalry Regiment .

 After the Civil War , Carpenter was serving as a first lieutenant in the Regular U.S. Army and volunteered for cavalry duty with " Negro Troops " that were being raised . The 10th U.S. Cavalry was formed at Fort Leavenworth , Kansas in 1866 as an all African @-@ American regiment . By the end of July 1867 , eight companies of enlisted men had been recruited from the Departments of Missouri , Arkansas , and the Platte . Life at Leavenworth was not pleasant for the 10th Cavalry . The fort 's commander , who was openly opposed to African @-@ Americans serving in the Regular Army , made life for the new troops difficult . Benjamin Grierson sought to have his regiment transferred , and subsequently received orders moving the regiment to Fort Riley , Kansas . This began on the morning of August 6 , 1867 and was completed the next day in the afternoon of August 7 . 
 Carpenter accepted the rank of captain in the Regular Army on July 28 , 1866 and took command of the African American troops of " D " company , 10th U.S. Cavalry . The 10th U.S. Cavalry regiment was composed of black enlisted men and white officers , which was typical for that era . Carpenter was assigned to the newly formed Company H on July 21 , 1867 and served with these original " Buffalo Soldiers " for thirteen years of near continuous conflict with the Native Americans in the southwest United States . Carpenter was dispatched to Philadelphia to recruit non @-@ commissioned officers in late summer and fall of 1867 . His efforts contributed to the high level of veteran soldiers who became the core non @-@ commissioned officers of the 10th Cavalry . 
 Carpenter 's men respected him , and his company had the lowest documented desertion rate of the Regular Army during his charge . He was known as being fair , firm , and consistent . He learned , saw and understood , the hardships and racial bigotry his men faced . After his service with the 10th , he campaigned and defended what his Buffalo Soldiers had done and could do . His ability to train and lead was notable and set a standard for all cavalry units . 
 = = = = Battle of Beecher Island = = = = 
 On September 17 , 1868 , Lieutenant Colonel G. A. Forsyth with a mounted party of 48 white scouts , was attacked at dawn . Forsyth , seeing no viable route for retreat , made a stand on a sandbar in the river . He was attacked by a force of about 200 @-@ 300 Indian warriors on a sand island up the North Fork of the Republican River ; this action became the Battle of Beecher Island . The Indians were primarily Cheyenne , supported by members of the Arapaho tribe under the Cheyenne War Chief Roman Nose , who was killed during the battle . Forsyth dispatched Simpson " Jack " Stilwell and Pierre Trudeau to seek help from Fort Wallace , more than 60 miles ( 97 km ) away . They were both able to reach Fort Wallace where rescue plans were quickly made . 
 Three rescue parties went out on different routes to find the endangered party . The first , led by Lieutenant Colonel Carpenter in charge of Troop H & I of the 10th Cavalry Regiment , relieved Forsyth on September 25 . Forsyth had been shot in the thigh , breaking his leg , and in the forehead . He was not expected to survive another day . 
 = = = = Battle of Beaver Creek = = = = 
 On October 14 , 1868 , two weeks after Carpenter had returned to Fort Wallace with the survivors of Forsyth ’ s command , he was ordered out once again . Troops H and I of the 10th Cavalry sallied forth to escort Major Carr of the 5th Cavalry to his new command with supplies to Beaver Creek . Near there Carpenter 's supply train and command was attacked by a force of about 500 Indians with no sign of the 5th Cavalry present . 
 Carpenter , seeking a more defensive posture closer to Beaver Creek , advanced for a short period then circled the supply wagons in a defensible area . This was possible because his mounted troopers fought a mobile delaying action . On his command , Carpenter 's men rushed inside at the gallop . They dismounted and took up a defensive firing line at the gap between the wagons they had just entered . 
 On Carpenter 's command , several massive volleys of aimed Spencer repeating rifles hit the front waves of the mounted Indians . The volleys decimated them as if hit by cannon filled with musket balls . A number of warriors , dismounted and using their ponies as bullet breaks , returned fire . Nearly all of these warriors died along with their ponies . Only three warriors made it to within fifty yards of the wagons before their demise . The Indians were so traumatized and demoralized by Carpenter 's defense that they did not renew their attack . 
 Carpenter 's troopers then accomplished their primary task by sending out scouts to find the location of the 5th Cavalry . This was done without further incident and they arrived back to Fort Wallace on October 21 . 
 Carpenter 's command had traveled some 230 miles in a week , routed some 500 mounted Indians , delivered the needed supplies with the new commander of the 5th Cavalry and completed all as effectively and professionally as any other command could do . For their gallantry in this fight on Beaver Creek , the officers and men of the " Buffalo Soldiers " were thanked by General Sheridan in a general field order and in official dispatches to the War Department in Washington . Captain Carpenter was brevetted Colonel . " In 1898 , for his efforts in September and October 1868 , Carpenter became one of seven 10th Cavalry soldiers to be awarded the Medal of Honor during its service on the frontier . 
 = = = = Defense of the Wichita I = = = = 
 The 10th Regimental headquarters remained at Fort Gibson until March 31 , 1869 , when they moved to Camp Wichita , Indian Territory ( now the state of Oklahoma ) . They arrived on April 12 , 1869 . Camp Wichita was an old Indian village inhabited by the Wichita tribe on the Anadarko Reservation . General Sheridan had selected a site nearby for a military post and Carpenter with the rest of the 10th Cavalry was ordered there to establish and build it . Some time in the following month of August , the post was given the name of Fort Sill . Civil War Brigadier General Joshua W. Sill was a classmate and friend of Sheridan who was killed in action in 1862 . 
 On June 12 , 1869 , Camp Supply was attacked by a raiding party of Comanche intent on stealing cavalry mounts . The 3rd Infantry with Troops A & F of the 10th Cavalry pursued them , but were ambushed by the warriors . Carpenter with Troops H , I , & K flanked the Indians , forcing them to withdraw . 
 On August 22 & 23 , 1869 , Carpenter and other troopers became involved in a fierce attack by Kiowa and <unk> Indians , who were focused on destroying the buildings and settlement on the Anadarko Reservation . Carpenter , with Troops H and L , patrolled the area aggressively and engaged several groups of warriors who were setting prairie fires upwind of the settlement at different points . Further and increasingly violent assaults were made by the Native Americans , in numbers ranging from 50 to 500 at different points of the defensive lines . The decisive feature of the engagement was a charge made by Captain Carpenter 's troopers . His men routed a body of over 150 warriors , who were about to take up a commanding position in rear of other defenders . On June 5 , 1872 , the 10th left Fort Sill to elements of the 3rd Infantry and proceeded back to Fort Gibson . 
 = = = = Satank , Satanta and Big Tree = = = = 
 In May 1871 , Carpenter was involved in the capture and escort of the Kiowa warrior and medicine man Satank , along with the Kiowa War Chiefs Santana , and Big Tree at Fort Sill , Indian Territory , now in Oklahoma . General Sherman was present at the fort due to an inspection tour ; also present was Colonel Benjamin Grierson . These three Native American leaders were the first to be tried , for raids ( Warren Wagon Train Raid ) and murder , in a United States civil court instead of a military court . This would deny them any vestige of rights as prisoners of war by being tried as any common criminal in the Court of the Thirteenth Judicial District of Texas in <unk> , Texas near Fort Richardson . 
 The military leaders at the fort had been given written information from the Indian Agent regarding the killings during the raid . Plans were made to arrest the Indians involved . D Troop was hidden on foot behind the main office building . Carpenter had mounted troopers waiting nearby . Sherman and Grierson sat on the porch , reviewing the situation and waiting for the Indians to arrive . When the Indians came , they blatantly boasted of what they had done . After Sherman told the Indians they were under arrest , a signal was given and the dismounted troopers came forward with carbines and pistols in hand . Lone Wolf , supporting the Kiowa Chiefs , pulled a rifle out from under his blanket <unk> and pointed it at Sherman . Sherman , ready for any problem , quickly disarmed him before the trigger could be pulled . Big Tree made an attempt to escape but was quickly subdued by Carpenter 's mounted troopers . Sherman decided that these men were criminals to be tried in a civil court and Carpenter was told to get it done . 
 Carpenter faced many problems associated with this , including the possibility of the Indians being rescued by their followers or being lynched by angry settlers , during their transport to the civilian court . During transport , Satank hid himself under his red blanket in his wagon while he gnawed the base of his thumb to the bone . This allowed him to slip the <unk> from his wrist while he sang his death chant . With a small hidden knife that was not found during two separate searches , he stabbed the driver ( who survived ) , both falling out of the wagon , grabbed a soldier 's unloaded carbine and was mortally wounded in his escape attempt . 
 The other two Kiowa were tried , found guilty , sentenced to death , had their sentences commuted to life and then paroled within a few years . They violated parole by raiding ; Satanta was sent to the Huntsville State Penitentiary in Texas where , in despair , he later killed himself . Big Tree , who presented witnesses to his non @-@ involvement , was returned to the reservation and accepted pacification . He lived on in the sadness of a warrior in exile . He later became a Christian and eventually , a minister in the Baptist church . The same Kiowa chief who had supervised the torture and burning of captives went about converting his own people to Christ . There were days , he would proudly recount his cruel acts against the white man , although it is faithfully recorded that he always concluded those tales with the solemn note that God had forgiven him for those " hideous " acts . 
 = = = = Defense of the Wichita II = = = = 
 In August 1874 , Carpenter became involved in fighting at Anadarko Reservation , Wichita , Indian Territory . This fighting is considered the first of many clashes during the Red River War ( 1874 – 75 ) . Carpenter , with Troops H & I was sent to support Fort Sill and by using aggressive patrols engaged several Kiowa and Comanche raiding parties . The relatively peaceful Wichita Indians on the reservation were targets of the hostile Indians because of their increasing positive status under pacification . The 10th were sent to Fort Concho in Texas where they were established on April 17 , 1875 . The exception was Carpenter 's troop stationed at Fort Davis as of May 1 , 1875 . 
 = = = = Victorio Campaign and map making = = = = 
 Carpenter became heavily involved in the Victorio Campaign of 1879 – 80 . Victorio was a warrior and chief of the <unk> band of the Chiricahua Apaches . From January 12 , 1880 to May 12 , 1880 , Carpenter directed scouting missions into the isolated <unk> Mountains bordering the United States with Mexico . The surrounding area on the American side was the high desert of far West Texas . This is where Victorio and other Apaches had been making raids . These scouts helped provide the first reliable maps drawn in the areas of operation . Finding waterholes and mapping the area was a critical step in Victorio campaign . On May 12 , 1880 , when eight Apaches attacked a nearby wagon train . Captain Carpenter and H Company pursued the Apaches to the Rio Grande . There , under orders , Carpenter had to stop at the international border with Mexico . 
 = = = = = Rattlesnake Springs = = = = = 
 Colonel Grierson , commander of the 10th Cavalry , traversed the hot Chihuahuan Desert and then the narrow valleys of the <unk> Mountains , reaching Rattlesnake Springs on the morning of August 6 , 1880 . His cavalrymen and their mounts were worn down from the forced march of over 65 miles in 21 hours . After resting and getting water , Grierson carefully placed his men in ambush positions . Carpenter , with his two cavalry troops , arrived as reinforcements and were posted in reserve a short distance south of the spring . The cavalrymen settled down to wait as Indian scouts brushed away any sign of their presence . 
 A little after two o 'clock in the afternoon , Victorio and his Apaches slowly approached the springs . Victorio somehow sensed danger and halted his men . With the hostile Apaches in their sights appearing ready to bolt , the soldiers did not wait and opened fire on their own initiative ; Victorio 's men scattered and withdrew out of carbine range . Victorio 's people needed water and believing that there were only a few soldiers present , regrouped and attacked immediately . As the battle progressed , Victorio sent his warriors to flank the soldiers . Carpenter charged forward with Companies B and H and a few massed volleys from their carbines sent the hostiles scattering back up the canyon . Stunned by the presence of such a strong force but in desperate need of water , Victorio repeatedly charged the cavalrymen in attempts to reach the spring . Grierson 's cavalry defenders , now bolstered by Carpenter 's two companies , stood firm . The last such attempt to break the soldiers was conducted near nightfall and when it failed , Victorio and his followers withdrew into the westward into the mountains . Carpenter with his two companies remounted in pursuit until darkness halted the effort . 
 On August 7 , Carpenter , with Captain Nolan as second in command , and three companies of troopers headed out to Sulfur Springs to deny that source of water to the Apaches . In the early light of day , Victorio saw a string of wagons rounding a mountain spur to the southeast and about eight miles distant , crawling onto the plain . Victorio sent a band of warriors riding out of the mountains and attacked savagely . The wagons held a load of provisions for Fort Davis with a company of infantry riding in some of the wagons . The warriors were met with rifle fire , as the teamsters circled the wagons in defensive positions . Alerted by his Indian scouts , Carpenter and two companies charged to the rescue . The Apache attack disintegrated as the warriors fled in confusion to the southwest to rejoin Victorio 's main force as it moved deeper into the Carrizo Mountains . Nolan 's ambush was not ready and the scattered warriors were able to avoid them . 
 = = = = = Pursuit of Victorio = = = = = 
 On August 9 , fifteen Texas Rangers with their Indian scouts , located Victorio 's main supply camp on Sierra Diablo . The Rangers joined Carpenter in the attack while Nolan guarded Sulfur Springs . Carpenter 's attack scattered the Indian guards while the troopers secured 25 head of cattle , provisions and several pack animals . Victorio under increasing pressure , short of food and more importantly water , began to head south in two main groups . By August 11 , Carpenter was on the trail in pursuit but , with horses tired and thirsty from the campaign , the chase was slow . Carpenter divided his command , with Nolan with his company and Texas Rangers on one route , while he took the rest of the command on another route . On August 13 , Nolan reached the Rio Grande where Indian scouts reported that Victorio had crossed the border into Mexico the evening before . Carpenter arrived later and ordered the cavalrymen to rest near the river . 
 On October 14 , 1880 , a sharpshooter of the Mexican Army ended Victorio 's life at Cerro Tres Castillos , in the state of Chihuahua , Mexico . He was survived by his warrior sister <unk> who continued fighting . She was captured in 1886 by Buffalo Soldiers of the 9th Cavalry . 
 Over 34 @,@ 420 miles of uncharted terrain were charted from 1875 to 1885 by Carpenter and other officers of the 10th Cavalry in West Texas . They added 300 plus miles of new roads with over 200 miles of telegraph lines . The scouting expeditions took the Buffalo soldiers through some of the harshest and desolate terrain ever documented in the American west . Excellent maps were provided by Carpenter and other officers showing the scarce water holes , mountain passes and grazing areas . These efforts by Carpenter and others of the 10th Cavalry were completed under adverse weather , limited supplies and the primitive equipment of the day . They had to be on the alert for the unexpected hit and run raids from Apaches and other Native American hostiles and bandits of all types . "

 From August 30 , 1878 to May 29 , 1879 , Carpenter , while holding the rank of captain in the Regular Army , but brevetted as a colonel in the 10th Cavalry , served as Commanding Officer of Fort Davis . Later , he served another period of command at the fort , between June 13 to July 27 , 1879 . Carpenter was then transferred to the 5th Cavalry with promotion to major , Regular Army , on February 17 , 1883 . 
 On July 4 , 1888 , on the battlefield of Gettysburg , Carpenter was " court @-@ martialed " for being absent without leave the previous day . He proved that his absence was due to the Secretary of War who , unmindful of Carpenter 's duties as a former member of the Sixth U.S. Cavalry in the Civil War , had neglected to issue orders to Carpenter in time to allow him to reach Fairfield for their 5th annual veteran 's reunion . Major Carpenter , then commanding officer of Fort Myer , was on duty with a contingent of soldiers at the bequest of William Crowninshield Endicott , the Secretary of War , for the 25th anniversary of the Battle of Gettysburg and its Blue & Gray reunions .

 Carpenter served as the first Director of the " Cavalry and Light Artillery School " at Fort Riley , Kansas as a lieutenant colonel , Regular Army , 7th Cavalry ( 1892 – 1897 ) . This school " formed the basis for practical instruction that enabled the officers and men who participated to study the duties of the soldier in garrison , in camp , and on the march . " He also served as President of the Board to <unk> Cavalry Tactics for the United States Army . 
 In 1891 , the United States Army conducted an experiment to integrate Indian soldiers into Regular Army units . While the primary object was to give employment , another was to utilize the talents of warriors from the most dangerous tribes . A significant number were sent to the " Cavalry School " at Fort Riley starting in late 1892 . They received training not only in cavalry tactics , but in hygiene and classes in English . Unfortunately , probably by the lack of patience on part of the United States Army , and partly because of language difficulties and racial discrimination , the experiment failed and was discontinued in 1897 . Carpenter had handpicked Lieutenant Hugh L. Scott to organize and command Troop L ( composed of Kiowa , Comanche , and Apache Indians ) for the 7th Cavalry . Scott commanded Troop L from inception to release of duty . Troop L , noted for their " deportment and discipline " , was the last of these Native @-@ American Troops to be disbanded soon after the " final review " of the Cavalry School 's Director . Carpenter was promoted to lieutenant colonel , Regular Army , 2nd Cavalry on July 28 , 1892 and transferred to the 5th Cavalry on August 28 , 1892 serving at Fort Riley , Kansas . He was transferred to the 7th Cavalry on September 22 , 1894 . He was promoted to colonel , Regular Army , while stationed with the 7th Cavalry on June 2 , 1897 and on May 4 , 1898 , he was commissioned a brigadier general of volunteers for the duration of the Spanish – American War . 
 General Carpenter commanded the 1st Division , 3rd Corps at Chickamauga and afterwards commanded the 3rd Division , 4th Corps at Tampa , Florida . Later , he was ordered to Cuba to occupy the Providence of Puerto Principe with a force consisting of the 8th Cavalry , 15th Infantry and the 3rd Georgia Volunteers . His were the first troops to take station in Cuba after the Battle of Santiago de Cuba . Carpenter was appointed Military Governor of the province and remained in that capacity until June 12 , 1899 when he was honorably discharged and reverted to his regular army rank of colonel . Colonel Carpenter was promoted on October 18 , 1899 , to brigadier general , Regular Army ; he then retired the next day , at his own request , having served honorably for 38 years . 
 = = Retirement = = 
 After retiring from the Army Carpenter went home to Philadelphia but never married or had any children . He updated and completed the book his father Edward Carpenter started on his family 's genealogical research , publishing it in 1912 , regarding his immigrant ancestor Samuel Carpenter . 
 He spent time writing about his Civil War service and his time on the Western Frontier . His work on the May 1864 Richmond Raid , also known as Sheridan ’ s raid , with the resulting Battle of Yellow Tavern where Confederate Army Major General J.E.B. Stuart was mortally wounded is still used as a basic reference . He gave many talks and wrote articles for the <unk> The Grand Army of the Republic was a fraternal organization composed of veterans of the Union Army who had served in the American Civil War .

 = Hurricane Erick ( 2013 ) = 
 Hurricane Erick brought minor impact to the western coastline of Mexico in July 2013 . The fifth tropical cyclone and named storm , as well as the fourth hurricane of the annual hurricane season , Erick originated from a tropical wave that moved off the western coast of Africa on June 18 . The wave tracked swiftly westward with little development , emerging into the eastern Pacific on July 1 . As a result of favorable environmental conditions , the wave developed into a tropical depression on July 4 , and further into Tropical Storm Erick at 0000 UTC on July 5 . Steered generally west @-@ northwest , Erick intensified into a Category 1 hurricane and reached its peak intensity with winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) on July 6 . Its proximity to land and track over increasingly cooler waters caused the storm to deteriorate into a tropical storm the following day , though it remained at such intensity until degenerating into a remnant low early on July 9 . The remnant circulation dissipated a few hours later , southwest of Baja California Sur . 
 In preparation for the cyclone , numerous tropical cyclone warnings and watches were issued for various portions of the coastline of Mexico . Ports were closed and residents in low @-@ lying areas were asked to evacuate to higher grounds . In addition , shipping by means of boat was suspended . Though the center of Erick remained offshore , the outer bands of the system brought gusty winds and isolated heavy rainfall to Western Mexico . In Guerrero , minor flooding was reported in the cities of Acapulco and Puerto Marques . A river overflowed its banks in Nayarit , flooding several cities in the state . Numerous cars , streets , and homes were damaged by flooding . A woman died as she attempted to flee her house , while a man was killed after being swept away by the river . Hundreds of people were rescued by the Mexican military and Nayarit officials . Across Baja California Sur , the storm produced widespread precipitation , leading to flooding . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On June 18 , a tropical wave emerged off the western coastline of Africa and into the eastern Atlantic . Tracking steadily westward , it maintained a small but organized area of convection — shower and thunderstorm activity — along its axis for the next several days . The wave crossed the Lesser Antilles on June 24 and Central America on June 29 , emerging into the eastern Pacific shortly thereafter . During the evening of July 1 , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) began monitoring the system , noting that environmental conditions were expected to become favorable for slow development . The wave interacted with a larger area of low pressure on July 2 , leading to an increase in convective coverage and the formation of a broad low @-@ pressure area . Continuing slowly westward , the system acquired enough organization to be declared a tropical depression at 1200 UTC on July 4 , while centered 205 mi ( 330 km ) southeast of Acapulco , Mexico . Despite the initially exposed center of circulation , a byproduct of moderate wind shear , the depression soon began to organize as convective banding increased and gained more curvature . This led to the classification of Tropical Storm Erick at 0000 UTC on July 5 . 
 Under the influence of a mid @-@ level ridge over the northwestern Caribbean Sea and an upper @-@ level ridge over the southwestern United States , the newly upgraded Erick tracked west @-@ northwest parallel to the coastline of Mexico . A central dense overcast formed by the daylight hours of July 5 , with tight banding noted on satellite . In addition , microwave imagery indicated the formative stages of an eyewall . Initially vertically decoupled , the storm became more vertically aligned throughout the following hours . A ragged eye became intermittently visible on satellite , and Erick was upgraded to Category 1 hurricane status at 0600 UTC , located approximately 105 mi ( 170 km ) west @-@ southwest of Lázaro Cárdenas , Mexico . In conjunction with satellite intensity estimates , it is estimated that Erick attained its peak intensity with maximum sustained winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of 983 mb ( hPa ; 29 @.@ 03 inHg ) at 1200 UTC . Shortly thereafter , its proximity to the coastline of Mexico and track over increasingly cooler waters caused the storm to begin a weakening trend . At 1800 UTC on July 7 , Erick weakened to a tropical storm as its associated convective mass warmed and the eye deteriorated . Wind shear caused the center of circulation to become exposed on July 9 as the system passed just south of Baja California Sur , leading to degeneration into a remnant low @-@ pressure area at 0600 UTC . The remnant vortex persisted for a few more hours , before dissipating over cold sea surface temperatures at 0000 UTC on July 10 .

 Following the system 's designation , a tropical storm watch was issued for the southwestern coastline of Mexico stretching from Acapulco to La Fortuna . By 0300 UTC on July 5 , the watch was extended from Acapulco to Manzanillo , while a tropical storm warning was issued from Lázaro Cárdenas to Manzanillo . Several hours later , the watch was discontinued for the coastline stretching from Acapulco to Lázaro Cárdenas and issued from La Fortuna to Cabo Corrientes . Meanwhile , the warning from Lázaro Cárdenas to Manzanillo was discontinued , with a new warning issued from Zihuatanejo to La Fortuna . All tropical storm watches in effect were discontinued by 0300 UTC the following morning , with the warning being extended from Zihuatanejo to Cabo Corrientes . After being upgraded to a hurricane , Erick prompted the issuance of hurricane watches stretching from Punta San Telmo to Cabo Corrientes . At 1500 UTC on July 6 , a tropical storm watch was issued from Santa Fe to La Paz , though this was upgraded to a warning several hours later . Following many other revisions , all tropical cyclone watches and warnings were discontinued after Erick degenerated into a remnant low early on July 9 . 
 In preparation for the tropical cyclone , an " orange " alert was issued for southern Michoacán , southern Jalisco , and the entire state of Colima , while a " yellow " alert was posted for the rest of the Jalisco coastline . The ports of Acapulco , Zihuatanejo , and <unk> were closed . In fear of flash flooding , residents along low @-@ lying areas of Acapulco were urged to evacuate . Meanwhile , the government of Michoacán ordered the suspension of shipping by boat . 
 Despite remaining offshore , the outer rainbands of the storm affected the southwestern coastline with gusty winds and heavy rainfall , with similar effects farther northwest . In Acapulco and Puerto Marques , the storm was responsible for minor flooding . Elsewhere across the state , damage was minor and mostly due to landslides . Along the coast of Colima , waves up to 9 ft ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) were recorded . Although some flooding was reported across the state , damage was considered minor . 
 Further north , Erick brought extensive flood damage to Nayarit . A 74 @-@ year @-@ old woman died while trying to escape her flooded house , while dozens of vehicles were damaged and several other streets and homes were flooded . One river overflowed its banks , affecting numerous cities . Officials in Nayarit attempted to rescue hundreds of people affected by Hurricane Erick , many of whom waited on streets to be rescued . Dozens of families were directly affected by the storm . Substantial amounts of debris piled up on streets . Residents reported severe economical losses , especially in <unk> , where a disaster declaration was necessary . Offshore , a waterspout was reported . In Tepic , Governor Roberto Sandoval ordered a state of emergency . Although the core of the system remained offshore , a " yellow " alert was issued for Baja California Sur . Heavy rain was recorded over much of the peninsula , resulting in flooding . The ports of La Paz , Cabo San Lucas , and San Jose del Cabo were closed due to high waves . Additionally , a " green " alert was issued for Baja California . In all , two people were killed while two others were missing . About 5 @,@ 500 people were homeless in <unk> . 
 = Mesa Verde National Park = 
 Mesa Verde National Park is a National Park and World Heritage Site located in Montezuma County , Colorado . It protects some of the best preserved Ancestral Puebloan archeological sites in the United States . 
 Created by President Theodore Roosevelt in 1906 , it occupies 52 @,@ 485 acres ( 21 @,@ 240 ha ) near the Four Corners region of the American Southwest , and with more than 4 @,@ 300 sites , including 600 cliff dwellings , it is the largest archeological preserve in the US . Mesa Verde ( Spanish for " green table " ) is best known for structures such as Cliff Palace , thought to be the largest cliff dwelling in North America . 
 Starting c . 7500 BCE , Mesa Verde was seasonally inhabited by a group of nomadic Paleo @-@ Indians known as the Foothills Mountain Complex . The variety of projectile points found in the region indicates they were influenced by surrounding areas , including the Great Basin , the San Juan Basin , and the Rio Grande Valley . Later , Archaic people established semi @-@ permanent rockshelters in and around the mesa . By 1000 BCE , the Basketmaker culture emerged from the local Archaic population , and by 750 CE the Ancestral Puebloans had developed from the Basketmaker culture . 
 The Mesa Verdeans survived using a combination of hunting , gathering , and subsistence farming of crops such as corn , beans , and squash . They built the mesa 's first pueblos sometime after 650 , and by the end of the 12th century , they began to construct the massive cliff dwellings for which the park is best known . By 1285 , following a period of social and environmental instability driven by a series of severe and prolonged droughts , they abandoned the area and moved south to locations in Arizona and New Mexico , including Rio Chama , Pajarito Plateau , and Santa Fe . 
 = = Inhabitants = = 
 = = = Paleo @-@ Indians = = = 
 The first occupants of the Mesa Verde region , which spans from southeastern Utah to northwestern New Mexico , were nomadic Paleo @-@ Indians who arrived in the area c . 9500 BCE . They followed herds of big game and camped near rivers and streams , many of which dried up as the glaciers that once covered parts of the San Juan Mountains receded . The earliest Paleo @-@ Indians were the Clovis culture and Folsom tradition , defined largely by the way in which they fashioned projectile points . Although they left evidence of their presence throughout the region , there is little indication that they lived in central Mesa Verde during this time . 
 After 9600 BCE , the area 's environment grew warmer and drier , a change that brought to central Mesa Verde pine forests and the animals that thrive in them . Paleo @-@ Indians began inhabiting the mesa in increasing numbers c . 7500 , though it is unclear whether they were seasonal occupants or year @-@ round residents . Development of the atlatl during this period made it easier for them to hunt smaller game , a crucial advance at a time when most of the region 's big game had disappeared from the landscape . 
 = = = Archaic = = = 
 6000 BCE marks the beginning of the Archaic period in North America . Archeologists differ as to the origin of the Mesa Verde Archaic population ; some believe they developed exclusively from local Paleo @-@ Indians , called the Foothills Mountain Complex , but others suggest that the variety of projectile points found in Mesa Verde indicates influence from surrounding areas , including the Great Basin , the San Juan Basin , and the Rio Grande Valley . The Archaic people probably developed locally , but were also influenced by contact , trade , and intermarriage with immigrants from these outlying areas . 
 The early Archaic people living near Mesa Verde utilized the atlatl and harvested a wider variety of plants and animals than the Paleo @-@ Indians had , while retaining their primarily nomadic lifestyle . They inhabited the outlying areas of the Mesa Verde region , but also the mountains , mesa tops , and canyons , where they created rockshelters and rock art , and left evidence of animal processing and chert <unk> . Environmental stability during the period drove population expansion and migration . Major warming and drying from 5000 to 2500 might have led middle Archaic people to seek the cooler climate of Mesa Verde , whose higher elevation brought increased snowpack that , when coupled with spring rains , provided relatively plentiful amounts of water . 
 By the late Archaic , more people were living in semi @-@ permanent rockshelters that preserved perishable goods such as baskets , sandals , and mats . They started to make a variety of twig figurines that usually resembled sheep or deer . The late Archaic is marked by increased trade in exotic materials such as obsidian and turquoise . Marine shells and abalone from the Pacific coast made their way to Mesa Verde from Arizona , and the Archaic people worked them into necklaces and pendants . Rock art flourished , and people lived in rudimentary houses made of mud and wood . Their early attempts at plant domestication eventually developed into the sustained agriculture that marked the end of the Archaic period , c . 1000 . 
 = = = Basketmaker culture = = = 
 With the introduction of corn to the Mesa Verde region c . 1000 BCE and the trend away from nomadism toward permanent <unk> settlements , the Archaic Mesa Verdeans transitioned into what archeologists call the Basketmaker culture . Basketmaker II people are characterized by their combination of foraging and farming skills , use of the atlatl , and creation of finely woven baskets in the absence of earthen pottery . By 300 , corn had become the preeminent staple of the Basketmaker II people 's diet , which relied less and less on wild food sources and more on domesticated crops . 
 In addition to the fine basketry for which they were named , Basketmaker II people fashioned a variety of household items from plant and animal materials , including sandals , robes , pouches , mats , and blankets . They also made clay pipes and gaming pieces . Basketmaker men were relatively short and muscular , averaging less than 5 @.@ 5 feet ( 1 @.@ 7 m ) tall . Their skeletal remains reveal signs of hard labor and extensive travel , including degenerative joint disease , healed fractures , and moderate anemia associated with iron deficiency . They buried their dead near or amongst their settlements , and often included luxury items as gifts , which might indicate differences in relative social status . Basketmaker II people are also known for their distinctive rock art , which can be found throughout Mesa Verde . They depicted animals and people , in both abstract and realistic forms , in single works and more elaborate panels . A common subject was the hunchbacked flute player that the Hopi call <unk> . 
 By 500 , CE atlatls were being supplanted by the bow and arrow and baskets by pottery , marking the end of the Basketmaker II Era and the beginning of the Basketmaker III Era . Ceramic vessels were a major improvement over pitch @-@ lined baskets , gourds , and animal hide containers , which had been the primary water storage containers in the region . Pottery also protected seeds against mold , insects , and rodents . By 600 , Mesa Verdeans were using clay pots to cook soups and stews . Year @-@ round settlements first appear around this time . The population of the San Juan Basin increased markedly after 575 , when there were very few Basketmaker III sites in Mesa Verde ; by the early 7th century , there were many such sites in the mesa . For the next 150 years , villages typically consisted of small groups of one to three residences . The population of Mesa Verde c . 675 was approximately 1 @,@ 000 to 1 @,@ 500 people . 
 Beans and new varieties of corn were introduced to the region c . 700 . By 775 , some settlements had grown to accommodate more than one hundred people ; the construction of large , above @-@ ground storage buildings began around this time . Basketmakers endeavored to store enough food for their family for one year , but also retained residential mobility so they could quickly relocate their dwellings in the event of resource depletion or consistently inadequate crop yields . By the end of the 8th century , the smaller hamlets , which were typically occupied for ten to forty years , had been supplanted by larger ones that saw continuous occupation for as many as two generations . Basketmaker III people established a tradition of holding large ceremonial gatherings near community pit structures . 
 = = = Ancestral Puebloans = = = 
 = = = = Pueblo I : 750 to 900 = = = = 
 750 marks the end of the Basketmaker III Era and the beginning of the Pueblo I period . The transition is characterized by major changes in the design and construction of buildings and the organization of household activities . Pueblo I people doubled their capacity for food storage from one year to two and built interconnected , year @-@ round residences called pueblos . Many household activities that had previously been reserved for subterranean pithouses were moved to these above @-@ ground dwellings . This altered the function of pithouses from all @-@ purpose spaces to ones used primarily for community ceremonies , although they continued to house large extended families , particularly during winter months . During the late 8th century , Mesa Verdeans began building square pit structures that archeologists call <unk> . They were typically 3 or 4 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 or 1 @.@ 22 m ) deep and 12 to 20 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 to 6 @.@ 1 m ) wide . 
 The first pueblos appeared at Mesa Verde sometime after 650 ; by 850 more than half of Mesa Verdeans lived in them . As local populations grew , Puebloans found it difficult to survive on hunting , foraging , and gardening , which made them increasingly reliant on domesticated corn . This shift from semi @-@ nomadism to a " sedentary and communal way of life changed ancestral Pueblo society forever " . Within a generation the average number of households in these settlements grew from one to three to fifteen to twenty , with average populations of two hundred people . Population density increased dramatically , with as many as a dozen families occupying roughly the same space that had formerly housed two . This brought increased security against raids and encouraged greater cooperation amongst residents . It also facilitated trade and intermarriage between clans , and by the late 8th century , as Mesa Verde 's population was being augmented by settlers from the south , four distinct cultural groups occupied the same villages . 
 Large Pueblo I settlements laid claim to the resources found within 15 to 30 square miles ( 39 to 78 km2 ) . They were typically organized in groups of at least three and spaced about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) apart . By 860 , there were approximately 8 @,@ 000 people living in Mesa Verde . Within the plazas of larger villages , the Pueblo I people dug massive pit structures of 800 square feet ( 74 m2 ) that became central gathering places . These structures represent early architectural expressions of what would eventually develop into the Pueblo II Era great houses of Chaco Canyon . Despite robust growth during the early and mid @-@ 9th century , unpredictable rainfall and periodic drought led to a dramatic reversal of settlement trends in the area . Many late Pueblo I villages were abandoned after less than forty years of occupation , and by 880 Mesa Verde 's population was in steady decline . The beginning of the 10th century saw widespread depopulation of the region , as people emigrated south of the San Juan River to Chaco Canyon in search of reliable rains for farming . As Mesa Verdeans migrated south , to where many of their ancestors had emigrated two hundred years before , the influence of Chaco Canyon grew , and by 950 Chaco had supplanted Mesa Verde as the region 's cultural center . 
 = = = = Pueblo II : 900 to 1150 = = = = 
 The Pueblo II Period is marked by the growth and outreach of communities centered around the great houses of Chaco Canyon . Despite their participation in the vast Chacoan system , Mesa Verdeans retained a distinct cultural identity while melding regional innovation with ancient tradition , inspiring further architectural advancements ; the 9th century Mesa Verdean pueblos influenced two hundred years of Chacoan great house construction . Droughts during the late 9th century rendered Mesa Verdean dry land farming unreliable , which led to their growing crops only near drainages for the next 150 years . Crop yields returned to healthy levels by the early 11th century . By 1050 the population of the area began to rebound ; as agricultural prosperity increased , people immigrated to Mesa Verde from the south . 
 Mesa Verdean farmers increasingly relied on masonry reservoirs during the Pueblo II Era . During the 11th century , they built check dams and terraces near drainages and slopes in an effort to conserve soil and runoff . These fields offset the danger of crop failures in the larger dry land fields . By the mid @-@ 10th and early 11th centuries , <unk> had evolved into smaller circular structures called kivas , which were usually 12 to 15 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 to 4 @.@ 6 m ) across . These Mesa Verde @-@ style kivas included a feature from earlier times called a <unk> , which is a hole dug in the north of the chamber and symbolizes the Ancestral Puebloan 's place of emergence from the underworld . At this time , Mesa Verdeans began to move away from the post and mud <unk> @-@ style buildings that marked the Pueblo I Period toward masonry construction , which had been utilized in the region as early as 700 , but was not widespread until the 11th and 12th centuries . 
 The expansion of Chacoan influence in the Mesa Verde area left its most visible mark in the form of Chaco @-@ style masonry great houses that became the focal point of many Mesa Verdean villages after 1075 . Far View House , the largest of these , is considered a classic Chaco " outlier , " on which construction likely began between 1075 and 1125 , although some archaeologists argue that it was begun as early as 1020 . The era 's timber and earth unit pueblos were typically inhabited for about twenty years . During the early 12th century , the locus of regional control shifted away from Chaco to Aztec , New Mexico , in the southern Mesa Verde region . By 1150 , drought had once again stressed the region 's inhabitants , leading to a temporary cessation of great house construction at Mesa Verde . 
 = = = = Pueblo III : 1150 to 1300 = = = = 
 A severe drought from 1130 to 1180 led to rapid depopulation in many parts of the San Juan Basin , particularly at Chaco Canyon . As the extensive Chacoan system collapsed , people increasingly migrated to Mesa Verde , causing major population growth in the area . This led to much larger settlements of six to eight hundred people , which reduced mobility for Mesa Verdeans , who had in the past frequently relocated their dwellings and fields as part of their agriculture strategy . In order to sustain these larger populations , they dedicated more and more of their labor to farming . Population increases also led to expanded tree felling that reduced habitat for many wild plant and animal species that the Mesa Verdeans had relied on , further deepening their dependency on domesticated crops that were susceptible to drought @-@ related failure . 
 The Chacoan system brought large quantities of imported goods to Mesa Verde during the late 11th and early 12th centuries , including pottery , shells , and turquoise , but by the late 12th century , as the system collapsed , the amount of goods imported by the mesa quickly declined , and Mesa Verde became isolated from the surrounding region . For approximately six hundred years , most Mesa Verdean farmers had lived in small , mesa @-@ top homesteads of one or two families . They were typically located near their fields and walking distance to sources of water . This practice continued into the mid- to late 12th century , but by the start of the 13th century they began living in canyon locations that were close to water sources and within walking distance of their fields . 
 Mesa Verdean villages thrived during the mid @-@ Pueblo III Era , when architects constructed massive , multi @-@ story buildings , and artisans adorned pottery with increasingly elaborate designs . Structures built during this period have been described as " among the world 's greatest archaeological treasures " . Pueblo III masonry buildings were typically occupied for approximately fifty years , more than double the usable lifespan of the Pueblo II <unk> structures . Others were continuously inhabited for two hundred years or more . Architectural innovations such as towers and multi @-@ walled structures also appear during the Pueblo III Era . Mesa Verde 's population remained fairly stable during the 12th century drought . At the start of the 13th century , approximately 22 @,@ 000 people lived there . The area saw moderate population increases during the following decades , and dramatic ones from 1225 to 1260 . Most of the people in the region lived in the plains west of the mesa at locations such as Yellow Jacket Pueblo , near Cortez , Colorado . Others colonized canyon rims and slopes in multi @-@ family structures that grew to unprecedented size as populations swelled . By 1260 , the majority of Mesa Verdeans lived in large pueblos that housed several families and more than one hundred people . 
 The 13th century saw 69 years of below average rainfall in the Mesa Verde region , and after 1270 the area suffered from especially cold temperatures . Dendrochronology indicates that the last tree felled for construction on the mesa was cut in 1281 . There was a major decline in ceramic imports to the region during this time , but local production remained steady . Despite challenging conditions , the Puebloans continued to farm the area until a severely dry period from 1276 to 1299 ended seven hundred years of continuous human occupation at Mesa Verde . Archeologists refer to this period as the " Great Drought " . The last inhabitants of the mesa left the area c . 1285 . 
 = = = = Warfare = = = = 
 During the Pueblo III period ( 1150 to 1300 ) , Mesa Verdeans built numerous stone masonry towers that likely served as defensive structures . They often incorporated hidden tunnels connecting the towers to associated kivas . Warfare was conducted using the same tools the Mesa Verdeans used for hunting game , including bows and arrows , stone axes , and wooden clubs and spears . They also crafted hide and basket shields that were used only during battles . Periodic warfare occurred on the mesa throughout the 13th century . Civic leaders in the region likely attained power and prestige by distributing food during times of drought . This system probably broke down during the " Great Drought " , leading to intense warfare between competing clans . Increasing economic and social uncertainty during the century 's final decades led to widespread conflict . Evidence of partly burned villages and post @-@ mortem trauma has been uncovered , and the residents of one village appear to have been the victims of a site @-@ wide massacre . 
 Evidence of violence and cannibalism has been documented in the central Mesa Verde region . While most of the violence , which peaked between 1275 and 1285 , is generally ascribed to in @-@ fighting amongst Mesa Verdeans , archeological evidence found at Sand Canyon Pueblo , in Canyons of the Ancients National Monument , suggests that violent interactions also occurred between Mesa Verdeans and people from outside the region . Evidence of the attacks was discovered by members of the Crow Canyon Archaeological Center during the 1990s . The assaults , which also occurred at the national monument 's Castle Rock Pueblo , were dated to c . 1280 , and are considered to have effectively ended several centuries of Puebloan occupation at those sites . Many of the victims showed signs of skull fractures , and the uniformity of the injuries suggest that most were inflicted with a small stone axe . Others were scalped , dismembered , and cannibalized . The anthropophagy ( cannibalism ) might have been undertaken as a survival strategy during times of starvation . The archeological record indicates that , rather than being isolated to the Mesa Verde region , violent conflict was widespread in North America during the late 13th and early 14th centuries , and was likely exacerbated by global climate changes that negatively affected food supplies throughout the continent . 
 = = = = Migration = = = = 
 The Mesa Verde region saw unusually cold and dry conditions during the beginning of the 13th century . This might have driven emigration to Mesa Verde from less hospitable locations . The added population stressed the mesa 's environment , further straining an agricultural society that was suffering from drought . The region 's bimodal precipitation pattern , which brought rainfall during spring and summer and snowfall during autumn and winter , began to fail post @-@ 1250 . After 1260 , there was a rapid depopulation of Mesa Verde , as " tens of thousands of people " emigrated or died from starvation . Many smaller communities in the Four Corners region were also abandoned during this period . The Ancestral Puebloans had a long history of migration in the face of environmental instability , but the depopulation of Mesa Verde at the end of the 13th century was different in that the region was almost completely emptied , and no descendants returned to build permanent settlements . While drought , resource depletion , and overpopulation all contributed to instability during the last two centuries of Ancestral Puebloan occupation , their overdependence on maize crops is considered the " fatal flaw " of their subsistence strategy . 
 The vacating Mesa Verdeans left almost no direct evidence of their migration , but they left behind household goods , including cooking utensils , tools , and clothing , which gave archeologists the impression that the emigration was haphazard or hurried . An estimated 20 @,@ 000 people lived in the region during the 13th century , but by the start of the 14th century the area was nearly uninhabited . Many emigrants relocated to southern Arizona and New Mexico . Although the rate of settlement is unclear , increases in sparsely populated areas , such as Rio Chama , Pajarito Plateau , and Santa Fe , correspond directly with the period of migration from Mesa Verde . Archeologists believe the Mesa Verdeans who settled in the areas near the Rio Grande , where Mesa Verde black @-@ on @-@ white pottery became widespread during the 14th century , were likely related to the households they joined and not unwelcome intruders . Archeologists view this migration as a continuation , versus a dissolution , of Ancestral Puebloan society and culture . Many others relocated to the banks of the Little Colorado River , in western New Mexico and eastern Arizona . While archeologists tend to focus on the " push " factors that drove the Mesa Verdeans away from the region , there were also several environmental " pull factors " , such as warmer temperatures , better farming conditions , plentiful timber , and bison herds , which incentivized relocation to the area near the Rio Grande . In addition to numerous settlements along the Rio Grande , contemporary descendants of the Mesa Verdeans live in pueblos at <unk> , Zuni , Jemez , and Laguna . 
 = = = = Organization = = = = 
 Although Chaco Canyon might have exerted regional control over Mesa Verde during the late 11th and early 12th centuries , most archeologists view the Mesa Verde region as a collection of smaller communities based on central sites and related outliers that were never fully integrated into a larger civic structure . Several ancient roads , averaging 15 to 45 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 to 13 @.@ 7 m ) wide and lined with earthen berms , have been identified in the region . Most appear to connect communities and shrines ; others encircle great house sites . The extent of the network is unclear , but no roads have been discovered leading to the Chacoan Great North Road , or directly connecting Mesa Verde and Chacoan sites . 
 Ancestral Puebloan shrines , called <unk> , have been identified near road segments in the region . Their purpose is unclear , but several C @-@ shaped <unk> have been excavated , and they are thought to have been " directional shrines " used to indicate the location of great houses . 
 = = = = Architecture = = = = 
 Mesa Verde is best known for a large number of well @-@ preserved cliff dwellings , houses built in alcoves , or rock overhangs along the canyon walls . The structures contained within these alcoves were mostly blocks of hard sandstone , held together and plastered with adobe mortar . Specific constructions had many similarities but were generally unique in form due to the individual topography of different alcoves along the canyon walls . In marked contrast to earlier constructions and villages on top of the mesas , the cliff dwellings of Mesa Verde reflected a region @-@ wide trend towards the aggregation of growing regional populations into close , highly defensible quarters during the 13th century . 
 Pueblo buildings were built with stone , windows facing south , and in U , E and L shapes . The buildings were located more closely together and reflected deepening religious celebration . Towers were built near kivas and likely used for lookouts . Pottery became more versatile , including pitchers , ladles , bowls , jars and dishware for food and drink . White pottery with black designs emerged , the pigments coming from plants . Water management and conservation techniques , including the use of reservoirs and silt @-@ retaining dams , also emerged during this period . Styles for these sandstone / mortar constructions , both surface and cliff dwellings , included T @-@ shaped windows and doors . This has been taken by some archaeologists , including Stephen H. Lekson , as evidence of the continuing reach of the Chacoan system . Other researchers see these elements as part of a more generalized Puebloan style and / or spiritual significance , rather than evidence of a continuing specific elite socioeconomic system . 
 While much of the construction in these sites is consistent with common Pueblo architectural forms , including kivas , towers , and pit @-@ houses , the space constrictions of these alcoves necessitated what seems to have been a far denser concentration of their populations . Mug House , a typical cliff dwelling of the period , was home to around 100 people who shared 94 small rooms and eight kivas built against each other and sharing many of their walls ; builders in these areas maximized space in any way they could , with no areas considered off @-@ limits to construction . 
 = = = = Astronomy = = = = 
 Mesa Verdeans used astronomical observations to plan their farming and religious ceremonies , drawing on both natural features in the landscape and masonry structures built for this purpose . Several great houses in the region were aligned to the cardinal directions , which positioned windows , doors , and walls along the path of the sun , whose rays would indicate the passing of seasons . Mesa Verde 's Sun Temple is thought to have been an astronomical observatory . 
 The temple is D @-@ shaped , and its alignment is 10 @.@ 7 degrees off true east @-@ west . Its location and orientation indicate that its builders understood the cycles of both the sun and the moon . It is aligned to the major lunar standstill , which occurs once every 18 @.@ 6 years , and the sunset during the winter solstice , which can be viewed setting over the temple from a platform at the south end of Cliff Palace , across Fewkes Canyon . At the bottom of the canyon is the Sun Temple fire pit , which is illuminated by the first rays of the rising sun during the winter solstice . Sun Temple is one of the largest exclusively ceremonial structures ever built by the Ancestral Puebloans . 
 = = = = Agriculture and water @-@ control systems = = = = 
 Starting in the 6th century , the farmers living in central Mesa Verde cultivated corn , beans , squash , and gourds . The combination of corn and beans provided the Mesa Verdeans with the amino acids of a complete protein . When conditions were good , 3 or 4 acres ( 1 @.@ 2 or 1 @.@ 6 ha ) of land would provide enough food for a family of three or four individuals for one year , providing they supplemented with game and wild plants . As Mesa Verdeans increasingly relied on corn as a dietary staple , the success or failure of crop yields factored heavily into their lives . The mesa tilts slightly to the south , which increased its exposure to the sun . Before the introduction of pottery , foods were baked , roasted , and parched . Hot rocks dropped into containers could bring water to a brief boil , but because beans must be boiled for an hour or more their use was not widespread until after pottery had disseminated throughout the region . With the increased availability of ceramics after 600 , beans became much easier to cook . This provided a high quality protein that reduced reliance on hunting . It also aided corn cultivation , as legumes add much needed nutrients to soils they are grown in , which likely increased corn yields . 
 The most Mesa Verdeans practiced dry farming , which relied on rain to water their crops , but others utilized runoff , springs , seeps , and natural collection pools . Starting in the 9th century , they dug and maintained reservoirs that caught runoff from summer showers and spring snowmelt ; some crops were watered by hand . Archeologists believe that prior to the 13th century , springs and other sources of water were considered shared public resources , but as Mesa Verdeans moved into increasingly larger pueblos built near or around water supplies control was privatized and limited to members of the surrounding community . 
 Between 750 and 800 , Mesa Verdeans began constructing two large water containment structures in canyon bottoms – the <unk> and Box Elder reservoirs . Soon afterward , work began on two more : the Far View and Sagebrush reservoirs , which were approximately 90 feet ( 27 m ) across and constructed on the mesa top . The reservoirs lie on an east @-@ west line that runs for approximately 6 miles ( 9 @.@ 7 km ) , which suggests builders followed a centralized plan for the system . In 2004 , the American Society of Civil Engineers designated these four structures as National Civil Engineering Historic Landmarks . A 2014 geospatial analyses suggested that neither collection nor retention of water was possible in the Far View Reservoir . This interpretation views the structure as a ceremonial space with procession roads in an adaptation of Chacoan culture . 
 = = = = Hunting and foraging = = = = 
 Mesa Verdeans typically harvested local small game , but sometimes organized hunting parties that traveled long distances . Their main sources of animal protein came from mule deer and rabbits , but they occasionally hunted Bighorn sheep , antelope , and elk . They began to domesticate turkeys starting around 1000 , and by the 13th century consumption of the animal peaked , supplanting deer as the primary protein source at many sites . These domesticated turkeys consumed large amounts of corn , which further deepened reliance on the staple crop . Puebloans wove blankets from turkey feathers and rabbit fur , and made implements such as awls and needles from turkey and deer bones . Despite the availability of fish in the area 's rivers and streams , archeological evidence suggests that they were rarely eaten . 
 Mesa Verdeans supplemented their diet by gathering the seeds and fruits of wild plants , searching large expanses of land while procuring these resources . Depending on the season , they collected piñon nuts and juniper berries , weedy goosefoot , <unk> , purslane , <unk> , tansy mustard , globe mallow , sunflower seeds , and yucca , as well as various species of grass and cacti . Prickly pear fruits provided a rare source of natural sugar . Wild seeds were cooked and ground up into porridge . They used sagebrush and mountain mahogany , along with piñon and juniper , for firewood . They also smoked wild tobacco . Because the Ancestral Puebloans considered all material consumed and discarded by their communities as sacred , their midden piles were viewed with reverence . Starting during the Basketmaker III period , c . 700 , Mesa Verdeans often buried their dead in these mounds . 
 = = = = Pottery = = = = 
 Scholars are divided as to whether pottery was invented in the Four Corners region or introduced from the south . Specimens of shallow , unfired clay bowls found at Canyon de Chelly indicate the innovation might have been derived from using clay bowls to <unk> seeds . Repeated uses rendered these bowls hard and impervious to water , which might represent the first fired pottery in the region . An alternate theory suggests that pottery originated in the Mogollon Rim area to the south , where brown @-@ paste bowls were used during the first few centuries of the common era . Others believe pottery was introduced to Mesa Verde from Mexico , c . 300 CE . There is no evidence of ancient pottery markets in the region , but archeologists believe that local potters exchanged decorative wares between families . Cooking pots made with crushed igneous rock tempers from places like Ute Mountain were more resilient and desirable , and Puebloans from throughout the region traded for them . 
 Neutron activation analysis indicates that much of the black @-@ on @-@ white pottery found at Mesa Verde was produced locally . Cretaceous clays from both the Dakota and Menefee Formations were used in black @-@ on @-@ white wares , and Mancos Formation clays for corrugated jars . Evidence that pottery of both types moved between several locations around the region suggests interaction between groups of ancient potters , or they might have shared a common source of raw materials . The Mesa Verde black @-@ on @-@ white pottery was produced at three locations : Sand Canyon , Castle Rock , and Mesa Verde . Archeological evidence indicates that nearly every household had at least one member who worked as a potter . Trench kilns were constructed away from pueblos and closer to sources of firewood . Their sizes vary , but the larger ones were up to 24 feet ( 7 @.@ 3 m ) long and thought to have been shared kilns that served several families . Designs were added to ceramic vessels with a Yucca @-@ leaf brush and paints made from iron , manganese , <unk> , and tansy mustard . 
 Most of the pottery found in 9th century pueblos was sized for individuals or small families , but as communal <unk> expanded during the 13th century , many larger , feast – sized vessels were produced . Corrugated decorations appear on Mesa Verde grey wares after 700 , and by 1000 entire vessels were crafted in this way . The technique created a rough exterior surface that was easier to hold on to than regular grey wares , which were smooth . By the 11th century these corrugated vessels , which dissipated heat more efficiently than smoother ones , had largely replaced the older style , whose tendency to retain heat made them prone to boiling over . <unk> likely developed as ancient potters attempted to mimic the visual properties of coiled basketry . Corrugated wares were made using clay from formations other than Menefee , which suggests that ancient potters selected different clays for different styles . Potters also selected clays and altered firing conditions to achieve specific colors . Under normal conditions , pots made of Mancos shale turned grey when fired , and those made of Morrison Formation clay turned white . Clays from southeastern Utah turned red when fired in a high @-@ oxygen environment . 
 = = = = Rock art and murals = = = = 
 Rock art is found throughout the Mesa Verde region , but its dispersion is uneven and periodic . Some locations have numerous examples ; others have none , and some periods saw prolific creation , while others saw little . Styles also vary over time . Examples are relatively rare on Mesa Verde proper , but abundant in the middle San Juan River area , which might indicate the river 's importance as a travel route and key source of water . Common motifs in the rock art of the region include , anthropomorphic figures in procession and during copulation or childbirth , handprints , animal and people tracks , wavy lines , spirals , concentric circles , animals , and hunting scenes . As the region 's population plummeted during the late 13th century , the subject of Mesa Verdean rock art increasingly shifted to depictions of shields , warriors , and battle scenes . Modern Hopi have interpreted the petroglyphs at Mesa Verde 's Petroglyph Point as depictions of various clans of people . 
 Starting during the late Pueblo II period ( 1020 ) and continuing through Pueblo III ( 1300 ) , the Ancestral Puebloans of the Mesa Verde region created plaster murals in their great houses , particularly in their kivas . The murals contained both painted and inscribed images depicting animals , people , and designs used in textiles and pottery dating back as far as Basketmaker III , c . 500 . Others depict triangles and mounds thought to represent mountains and hills in the surrounding landscape . The murals were typically located on the face of the kiva bench and usually encircled the room . Geometric patterns that resemble symbols used in pottery and zigzag that represent stitches used in basket making are common motifs . The painted murals include the colors red , green , yellow , white , brown , and blue . The designs were still in use by the Hopi during the 15th and 16th centuries . 
 = = Anthropogenic ecology , geography , and climate = = 
 Anthropogenic ecology refers to the human impact on animals and plants in an ecosystem . A shift from medium and large game animals , such as deer , bighorn sheep , and antelope , to smaller ones like rabbits and turkey during the mid @-@ 10th to mid @-@ 13th centuries might indicate that Mesa Verdean subsistence hunting had dramatically altered faunal populations on the mesa . Analysis of pack rat midden indicates that , with the exception of invasive species such as tumbleweed and clover , the flora and fauna in the area have remained relatively consistent for the past 4 @,@ 000 years . 
 Mesa Verde 's canyons were created by streams that eroded the hard sandstone that covers the area . This resulted in Mesa Verde National Park elevations ranging from about 6 @,@ 000 to 8 @,@ 572 feet ( 1 @,@ 829 to 2 @,@ 613 m ) , the highest elevation at Park Point . The terrain in the park is now a transition zone between the low desert plateaus and the Rocky Mountains . 
 The region 's precipitation pattern is bimodal , meaning agriculture is sustained through snowfall during winter and autumn and rainfall during spring and summer . The climate is semi @-@ arid . Water for farming and consumption was provided by summer rains , winter snowfall , and seeps and springs in and near the Mesa Verde villages . At 7 @,@ 000 feet ( 2 @,@ 100 m ) , the middle mesa areas were typically ten degrees cooler than the mesa top , which reduced the amount of water needed for farming . The cliff dwellings were built to take advantage of solar energy . The angle of the sun in winter warmed the masonry of the cliff dwellings , warm breezes blew from the valley , and the air was ten to twenty degrees warmer in the canyon alcoves than on the top of the mesa . In the summer , with the sun high overhead , much of the village was protected from direct sunlight in the high cliff dwellings . 
 = = Geology = = 
 Although the area 's first Spanish explorers named the feature Mesa Verde , the term is a misnomer , as true mesas are almost perfectly flat . Because Mesa Verde is slanted to the south , the proper geological term is cuesta , not mesa . The park is made up of several smaller <unk> located between canyons . Mesa Verde 's slant contributed to the formation of the alcoves that have preserved the area 's cliff dwellings . 
 In the late Cretaceous Period , the Mancos Shale was deposited on top of the Dakota Sandstone , which is the rock formation that can be found under much of Colorado . The beds of the Mancos Shale are " fine @-@ grained sand @-@ stones , mudstones , and shales " which accumulated in the deep water of the Cretaceous Sea . It has a high clay content which causes it to expand when wet leading to sliding of the terrain . On top of this shale , there are three formations in the <unk> group which reflect the changes in depositional environment in the area over time . The first is the Point Lookout Sandstone , which is named for the Point Lookout feature in the park ( elevation <unk> feet ) . This sandstone , which formed in the marine environment of shallow water when the Cretaceous sea was receding , is " massive , fine @-@ grained , cross @-@ bedded , and very resistant " , in its layers reflecting waves and currents that were present during the time of its formation . Its sediments are approximately 400 feet thick , and its upper layers feature fossiliferous invertebrates . 
 Next is the Menefee Formation , the middle formation whose content features interbedded carbonaceous shales , siltstones , and sandstones . These were deposited in semi @-@ marine environments of brackish water , such as swamps and lagoons . Due to its depositional environment and the organic material in its composition , there are thin coal seams running through the Menefee Formation . At the top , this formation is intruded upon by the Cliff House Sandstone . 
 The Cliff House Sandstone is the area 's youngest rock layer . It was formed after the Cretaceous sea had completely receded and as a result has a high sand content from beaches , dunes , etc. and from this receives its characteristic yellow tint to its canyon faces . Like the Point Lookout Sandstone , it is about 400 feet thick . It contains numerous fossil beds of different types of shells , fish teeth , and other invertebrate leftovers from the receded sea . The shale zones in this feature determine where alcoves formed where the Ancestral Puebloans constructed their dwellings . 
 Continuing through the Cretaceous period and into the early Tertiary , there was uplifting in the area of the Colorado Plateau , the San Juan Mountains , and the La Plata Mountains , which led to the formation of the Mesa Verde pediment with the help of erosion . Small channels of water ran across this formation depositing gravel . Later in the tertiary , the last period of uplift and rock tilting towards the south caused these streams to cut rapidly into the rock removing loose sediment and forming the vast canyons seen today . This caused the isolation of the Mesa Verde pediment from surrounding rock . Today , since the climate is more arid , these erosional processes are slowed . 
 = = Rediscovery = = 
 Mexican @-@ Spanish missionaries and explorers Francisco Atanasio Domínguez and Silvestre Vélez de Escalante , seeking a route from Santa Fe to California , faithfully recorded their travels in 1776 . They reached Mesa Verde ( green plateau ) region , which they named after its high , tree @-@ covered plateaus , but they never got close enough , or into the needed angle , to see the ancient stone villages . They were the first white men to travel the route through much of the Colorado Plateau into Utah and back through Arizona to New Mexico . 
 The Mesa Verde region has long been occupied by the Utes , and an 1868 treaty between them and the United States government recognized Ute ownership of all Colorado land west of the Continental Divide . After there had become an interest in land in western Colorado , a new treaty in 1873 left the Ute with a strip of land in southwestern Colorado between the border with New Mexico and 15 miles north . Most of Mesa Verde lies within this strip of land . The Ute wintered in the warm , deep canyons and found sanctuary there and the high plateaus of Mesa Verde . Believing the cliff dwellings to be sacred ancestral sites , they did not live in the ancient dwellings . 
 Occasional trappers and prospectors visited , with one prospector , John Moss , making his observations known in 1873 . The following year , Moss led eminent photographer William Henry Jackson through Mancos Canyon , at the base of Mesa Verde . There , Jackson both photographed and publicized a typical stone cliff dwelling . Geologist William H. Holmes retraced Jackson 's route in 1875 . Reports by both Jackson and Holmes were included in the 1876 report of the Hayden Survey , one of the four federally financed efforts to explore the American West . These and other publications led to proposals to systematically study Southwestern archeological sites . 
 In her quest to find Ancestral Puebloan settlements , Virginia McClurg , a journalist for the New York Daily Graphic , visited Mesa Verde in 1882 and 1885 . Her party rediscovered Echo Cliff House , Three Tier House , and Balcony House in 1885 ; these discoveries inspired her to protect the dwellings and artifacts . 
 = = = The Wetherills = = = 
 A family of cattle ranchers , the Wetherills , befriended members of the Ute tribe near their ranch southwest of Mancos , Colorado . With the Ute tribe 's approval , the Wetherills were allowed to bring cattle into the lower , warmer plateaus of the present Ute reservation during winter . Word of the Ancestral Puebloan great houses had spread , and <unk> , a member of the Ute tribe , told the Wetherills of a special cliff dwelling in Mesa Verde : " Deep in that canyon and near its head are many houses of the old people – the Ancient Ones . One of those houses , high , high in the rocks , is bigger than all the others . Utes never go there , it is a sacred place . " On December 18 , 1888 , Richard Wetherill and cowboy Charlie Mason rediscovered Cliff Palace after spotting the ruins from the top of Mesa Verde . Wetherill gave the ruin its present @-@ day name . Richard Wetherill , family and friends explored the ruins and gathered artifacts , some of which they sold to the Historical Society of Colorado and much of which they kept . Among the people who stayed with the Wetherills and explored the cliff dwellings was mountaineer , photographer , and author Frederick H. Chapin , who visited the region during 1889 and 1890 . He described the landscape and ruins in an 1890 article and later in an 1892 book , The Land of the Cliff @-@ Dwellers , which he illustrated with hand @-@ drawn maps and personal photographs . 
 = = = Gustaf Nordenskiöld = = = 
 The Wetherills also hosted Gustaf Nordenskiöld , the son of polar explorer Adolf Erik Nordenskiöld , in 1891 . Nordenskiöld was a trained mineralogist who introduced scientific methods to artifact collection , recorded locations , photographed extensively , diagrammed sites , and correlated what he observed with existing archeological literature as well as the home @-@ grown expertise of the Wetherills . He removed a lot of artifacts and sent them to Sweden , where they eventually went to the National Museum of Finland . Nordenskiöld published , in 1893 , The Cliff Dwellers of the Mesa Verde . When Nordenskiöld shipped the collection that he made of Mesa Verde artifacts , the event initiated concerns about the need to protect Mesa Verde land and its resources . 
 = = National Park = = 
 In 1889 , Goodman Point Pueblo became the first pre @-@ Columbian archeological site in the Mesa Verde region to gain federal protection . It was the first such site to be protected in the US . Virginia McClurg was diligent in her efforts between 1887 and 1906 to inform the United States and European community of the importance of protecting the important historical material and dwellings in Mesa Verde . Her efforts included enlisting support from 250 @,@ 000 women through the Federation of Women 's Clubs , writing and having published poems in popular magazines , giving speeches domestically and internationally , and forming the Colorado Cliff Dwellers Association . The Colorado Cliff Dwellers ' purpose was to protect the resources of Colorado cliff dwellings , reclaiming as much of the original artifacts as possible and sharing information about the people who dwelt there . A fellow activist for protection of Mesa Verde and prehistoric archeological sites included Lucy Peabody , who , located in Washington , D.C. , met with members of Congress to further the cause . Former Mesa Verde National Park superintendent Robert <unk> communicated his belief that the park might have been far more significant with the hundreds of artifacts taken by Nordenskiöld . 
 By the end of the 19th century , it was clear that Mesa Verde needed protection from people in general who came to Mesa Verde and created or sold their own collection of artifacts . In a report to the Secretary of the Interior , Smithsonian Institution Ethnologist Jesse Walter Fewkes described vandalism at Mesa Verde 's Cliff Palace : 
 Parties of " curio seekers " camped on the ruin for several winters , and it is reported that many hundred specimens there have been carried down the mesa and sold to private individuals . Some of these objects are now in museums , but many are forever lost to science . In order to secure this valuable archeological material , walls were broken down ... often simply to let light into the darker rooms ; floors were invariably opened and buried kivas mutilated . To facilitate this work and get rid of the dust , great openings were broken through the five walls which form the front of the ruin . Beams were used for firewood to so great an extent that not a single roof now remains . This work of destruction , added to that resulting from erosion due to rain , left Cliff Palace in a sad condition . 
 Many artifacts from Mesa Verde are now located in museums and private collections in the USA and across the world . A representative selection of pottery vessels and other objects , for example , is now in the British Museum in London . In 1906 , President Theodore Roosevelt approved creation of the Mesa Verde National Park and the Federal Antiquities Act of 1906 . The park was an effort to " preserve the works of man " and was the first of its kind . The park was named with the Spanish term for green table because of its forests of juniper and piñon trees . 
 = = = Excavation and protection = = = 
 From 1908 to 1922 , Spruce Tree House , Cliff Palace , and Sun Temple ruins were stabilized . Most of the early efforts were led by Jesse Walter Fewkes . During the 1930s and 40s , Civilian Conservation Corps workers , starting in 1932 , played key roles in excavation efforts , building trails and roads , creating museum exhibits and constructing buildings at Mesa Verde . From 1958 to 1965 , Wetherill Mesa Archeological Project included archeological excavations , stabilization of sites , and surveys . With excavation and study of eleven Wetherill Mesa sites , it is considered the largest archeological effort in the US . The project oversaw the excavation of Long House and Mug House . 
 In 1966 , as with all historical areas administered by the National Park Service , Mesa Verde was listed on the National Register of Historic Places , and in 1987 , the Mesa Verde Administrative District was listed on the register . It was designated a World Heritage Site in 1978 . In its 2015 travel awards , Sunset magazine named Mesa Verde National Park " the best cultural attraction " in the Western United States .

 The entrance to Mesa Verde National Park is on U.S. Route 160 , approximately 9 miles ( 14 km ) east of the community of Cortez and 7 miles ( 11 km ) west of Mancos , Colorado . The park covers 52 @,@ 485 acres ( 21 @,@ 240 ha ) It contains 4 @,@ 372 documented sites , including more than 600 cliff dwellings . It is the largest archeological preserve in the US . It protects some of the most important and best preserved archeological sites in the country . The park initiated the Archeological Site Conservation Program in 1995 . It analyses data pertaining to how sites are constructed and utilized . 
 The Mesa Verde Visitor and Research Center is located just off of Highway 160 and is before the park entrance booths . The Visitor and Research Center opened in December 2012 . Chapin Mesa ( the most popular area ) is 20 miles ( 32 km ) beyond the visitor center . Mesa Verde National Park is an area of federal exclusive jurisdiction . Because of this all law enforcement , emergency medical service , and wildland / structural fire duties are conducted by federal National Park Service Law Enforcement Rangers . The Mesa Verde National Park Post Office has the ZIP code <unk> . Access to park facilities vary by season . Three of the cliff dwellings on Chapin Mesa are open to the public . The Chapin Mesa Archeological Museum is open all year . Spruce Tree House is also open all year , weather permitting . Balcony House , Long House and Cliff Palace require tour tickets for ranger @-@ guided tours . Many other dwellings are visible from the road but not open to tourists . The park offers hiking trails , a campground , and , during peak season , facilities for food , fuel , and lodging ; these are unavailable in the winter . 
 = = = Wildfires and culturally modified trees = = = 
 During the years 1996 to 2003 , the park suffered from several wildfires . The fires , many of which were started by lightning during times of drought , burned 28 @,@ 340 acres ( 11 @,@ 470 ha ) of forest , more than half the park . The fires also damaged many archeological sites and park buildings . They were named : Chapin V ( 1996 ) , Bircher and Pony ( 2000 ) , Long Mesa ( 2002 ) , and the Balcony House Complex fires ( 2003 ) , which were five fires that began on the same day . The Chapin V and Pony fires destroyed two rock art sites , and the Long Mesa fire nearly destroyed the museum – the first one ever built in the National Park System – and Spruce Tree House , the third largest cliff dwelling in the park . 
 Prior to the fires of 1996 to 2003 , archeologists had surveyed approximately ninety percent of the park . Dense undergrowth and tree cover kept many ancient sites hidden from view , but after the Chapin V , Bircher and Pony fires , 593 previously undiscovered sites were revealed – most of them date to the Basketmaker III and Pueblo I periods . Also uncovered during the fires were extensive water containment features , including 1 @,@ 189 check dams , 344 terraces , and five reservoirs that date to the Pueblo II and III periods . In February 2008 , the Colorado Historical Society decided to invest a part of its $ 7 million budget into a culturally modified trees project in the National Park .

The exit , a series of toe @-@ holds in a cleft of the cliff , was believed to be the only entry and exit route for the cliff dwellers , which made the small village easy to defend and secure . One log was dated at 1278 , so it was likely built not long before the Mesa Verde people migrated out of the area . It was officially excavated in 1910 by Jesse Nusbaum , one of the first Superintendents of Mesa Verde National Park . Visitors can enter Balcony House through ranger @-@ guided tours .

Many of the rooms were brightly painted . Cliff Palace was home to approximately 125 people , but was likely an important part of a larger community of sixty nearby pueblos , which housed a combined six hundred or more people .

The cliff dwelling features 150 rooms , a kiva , a tower , and a central plaza . Its rooms are not clustered like typical cliff dwellings . Stones were used without shaping for fit and stability . Two overhead ledges contain storage space for grain . One ledge seems to include an overlook with small holes in the wall to see the rest of the village below .

 = Soedjatmoko = 
 Soedjatmoko ( born Soedjatmoko Mangoendiningrat ; 10 January 1922 – 21 December 1989 ) , familiarly called Bung Koko , was an Indonesian intellectual and diplomat . Born to a noble father and mother in Sawahlunto , West Sumatra , after finishing his primary education , he went to Batavia ( modern day Jakarta ) to study medicine ; in the city 's slums , he saw much poverty , which became an academic interest later in life . After being expelled from medical school by the Japanese in 1943 for his political activities , Soedjatmoko moved to Surakarta and practised medicine with his father . In 1947 , after Indonesia proclaimed its independence , Soedjatmoko and two other youths were deployed to Lake Success , New York , to represent Indonesia at the United Nations ( UN ) . They helped secure international recognition of the country 's sovereignty . 
 After his work at the UN , Soedjatmoko attempted to study at Harvard 's Littauer Center for Public Administration ( now the John F. Kennedy School of Government ) ; however , he was forced to resign due to pressure from other work , including serving as Indonesia 's first chargé d 'affaires in London for three months as well as establishing the political desk at the Embassy of Indonesia in Washington , D.C. By 1952 he had returned to Indonesia , where he became involved in the socialist press and joined the Socialist Party of Indonesia . He was elected as a member of the Constitutional Assembly of Indonesia in 1955 , serving until 1959 ; he married <unk> Gandasubrata in 1958 . However , as President Sukarno 's government became more authoritarian Soedjatmoko began to criticise the government . To avoid censorship , he spent two years as a guest lecturer at Cornell University in Ithaca , New York , and another three in self @-@ imposed unemployment in Indonesia . 
 After Sukarno was replaced by Suharto , Soedjatmoko returned to public service . In 1966 he was sent as one of Indonesia 's representatives at the UN , and in 1968 he became Indonesia 's ambassador to the US ; during this time he received several honorary doctoral degrees . He also advised foreign minister Adam Malik . After returning to Indonesia in 1971 , Soedjatmoko held a position in several think tanks . After the Malari incident in January 1974 , Soedjatmoko was held for interrogation for two and a half weeks and accused of masterminding the event . Although eventually released , he could not leave Indonesia for two and a half years . In 1978 Soedjatmoko received the Ramon Magsaysay Award for International Understanding , and in 1980 he was chosen as rector of the United Nations University in Tokyo . Two years after returning from Japan , Soedjatmoko died of cardiac arrest while teaching in Yogyakarta . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Soedjatmoko was born on 10 January 1922 in Sawahlunto , West Sumatra , with the name Soedjatmoko Mangoendiningrat . He was the eldest son of Saleh Mangoendiningrat , a Javanese physician of noble descent from Madiun , and <unk> , a Javanese housewife from <unk> ; the couple had three other children , as well as two adopted children . Soedjatmoko 's younger brother , Nugroho <unk> , went on to work at the United Nations . When he was two years old , he and his family moved to the Netherlands after his father received a five @-@ year scholarship . After returning to Indonesia , Soedjatmoko continued his studies at an elementary school for European called ELS in Manado , North Sulawesi . 
 Soedjatmoko later attended the Surabaya HBS ( secondary school ) and graduated in 1940 . The school introduced him to Latin and Greek , and one of his teachers introduced him to European art ; he later recalled that this introduction had allowed him to see Europeans as more than colonists . He then continued to medical school in Batavia ( modern day Jakarta ) . Upon seeing the slums of Jakarta , he was drawn to the issue of poverty ; this later became an academic interest of his . However , during the Japanese occupation , in 1943 , he was expelled from the city due to his relationship with Sutan Sjahrir – who had married Soedjatmoko 's sister Siti <unk> – and participation in protests against the occupation . 
 After his expulsion , Soedjatmoko moved to Surakarta and studied Western history and political literature , which led to an interest in socialism . Some figure that affected him besides Karl Marx were Ortega y Gasset and Jan Romein . While in Surakarta he also worked at his father 's hospital . After Indonesia proclaimed its independence , Soedjatmoko was asked to become Deputy Head of the Foreign Press Department in the Ministry of Information . In 1946 , at the request of Prime Minister Sjahrir , he and two friends established a Dutch @-@ language weekly , Het <unk> ( Inside ) , as a counter to the Dutch @-@ sponsored Het <unk> ( Outlook ) . The next year , they launched a socialist @-@ oriented journal , Siasat ( Tactics ) , which was published weekly . During this period Soedjatmoko dropped the name Mangoendiningrat , as it reminded him of the feudal aspects of Indonesian culture . 
 = = Work in the US = = 
 In 1947 , Sjahrir sent Soedjatmoko to New York as a member of the Indonesian Republic 's " observer " delegation to the United Nations ( UN ) . The delegation travelled to the United States via the Philippines after a two @-@ month stay in Singapore ; while in the Philippines , President Manuel Roxas guaranteed support of the nascent nation 's case at the United Nations . Soedjatmoko stayed in Lake Success , New York , the temporary location of the UN , and participated in debates over international recognition of the new country . Towards the end of his stay in New York , Soedjatmoko enrolled at Harvard 's Littauer Center ; as , at the time , he was still part of the UN delegation , he commuted between New York and Boston for seven months . After being released from the delegation , he spent most of a year at the Center ; for a period of three months , however , he was chargé d 'affaires – the nation 's first – at the Dutch East Indies desk of the Dutch embassy in London , serving in a temporary capacity while the Indonesian embassy was being established . 
 In 1951 , Soedjatmoko moved to Washington D.C. to establish the political desk at the Indonesian embassy there ; he also became Alternate Permanent Representative of Indonesia at the UN . This busy schedule , demanding a commute between three cities , proved to be too much for him and he dropped out of the Littauer Center . In late 1951 , he resigned from his positions and went to Europe for nine months , seeking political inspiration . In Yugoslavia , he met Milovan Djilas , who impressed him greatly . 
 = = Return to Indonesia = = 
 Upon returning to Indonesia , Soedjatmoko once again became an editor of Siasat . In 1952 , he was one of the founders of Socialist Party daily Pedoman ( Guidance ) ; this was followed by a political journal , Konfrontasi ( Confrontation ) . He also helped to establish the Pembangunan publishing house , which he directed until 1961 . Soedjatmoko joined the Indonesian Socialist Party ( Partai Sosialis Indonesia , or PSI ) in 1955 , and was elected as a member of Constitutional Assembly of Indonesia in the 1955 elections until the dissolution of the assembly in 1959 . He served with the Indonesian delegation at the Bandung Conference in 1955 . Later the same year , he founded the Indonesian Institute of World Affairs and became its Secretary General for four years . Soedjatmoko married <unk> Gandasubrata in 1958 . Together they had three daughters . 
 Towards the end of the 1950s , Soedjatmoko and President Sukarno , with whom he had had a warm working relationship , had a falling out over the president 's increasingly authoritarian policies . In 1960 Soedjatmoko co @-@ founded and headed the Democratic League , which attempted to promote democracy in the country ; he also opposed Sukarno 's Guided Democracy policy . When the effort failed , Soedjatmoko went to the US and took a position as guest lecturer at Cornell University . When he returned to Indonesia in 1962 , he discovered that key members of the PSI had been arrested and the party banned ; both Siasat and Pedoman were closed . To avoid trouble with the government , Soedjatmoko voluntarily left himself unemployed until 1965 , when he became co @-@ editor of An Introduction to Indonesian Historiography .

 After the failed coup d 'état in 1965 and the replacement of Sukarno by Suharto , Soedjatmoko returned to public service . He served as vice @-@ chairman of the Indonesian delegation at the UN in 1966 , becoming the delegation 's adviser in 1967 . Also in 1967 , Soedjatmoko became adviser to foreign minister Adam Malik , as well as a member of the International Institute for Strategic Studies , a London @-@ based think tank ; the following year he became Indonesian ambassador to the United States , a position which he held until 1971 . During his time as ambassador , Soedjatmoko received honorary doctorates from several American universities , including Cedar Crest College in 1969 and Yale in 1970 . He also published another book , Southeast Asia Today and Tomorrow ( 1969 ) . 
 Soedjatmoko returned to Indonesia in 1971 ; upon his return he became Special Adviser on Social and Cultural Affairs to the Chairman of the National Development Planning Agency . That same year , he became a board member of the London @-@ based International Institute for Environment and Development , a position which he held until 1976 ; he also joined the Club of Rome . In 1972 Soedjatmoko was selected to the board of trustees of the Ford Foundation , in which position he served 12 years ; also in 1972 he became a governor of the Asian Institute of Management , a position which he held for two years . The following year he became a governor of the International Development Research Center . In 1974 , based on falsified documents , he was accused of planning the Malari incident of January 1974 , in which students protested and eventually rioted during a state visit by Prime Minister of Japan Kakuei Tanaka . Held for interrogation for two and a half weeks , Soedjatmoko was not allowed to leave Indonesia for two and a half years for his suspected involvement . 
 In 1978 Soedjatmoko received the Ramon Magsaysay Award for International Understanding , often called Asia 's Nobel Prize . The citation read , in part : 
 Encouraging both Asians and outsiders to look more carefully at the village <unk> they would modernize , [ <unk> ] is fostering awareness of the human dimension essential to all development . [ ... ] [ H ] is writings have added consequentially to the body of international thinking on what can be done to meet one of the greatest challenges of our time ; how to make life more decent and satisfying for the poorest 40 percent in Southeastern and southern Asia . 
 In response , Soedjatmoko said he felt " humbled , because of [ his ] awareness that whatever small contribution [ he ] may have made is dwarfed by the magnitude of the problem of persistent poverty and human suffering in Asia , and by the realization of how much still remains to be done . "

 In 1980 Soedjatmoko moved to Tokyo , Japan . In September of that year he began service as the rector of the United Nations University , replacing James M. Hester ; he remained in that position until 1987 . In Japan he published two further books , The Primacy of Freedom in Development and Development and Freedom . He received the Asia Society Award in 1985 , and the Universities Field Staff International Award for Distinguished Service to the Advancement of International Understanding the following year . Soedjatmoko died of cardiac arrest on 21 December 1989 when he was lecturing at Muhammadiyah University of Yogyakarta . 
 = Instinct ( Orphan Black ) = 
 " Instinct " is the second episode of the first season of the Canadian science fiction television series Orphan Black . It first aired in Canada on Space and the United States on BBC America on 6 April 2013 . The episode was written by Graeme Manson and directed by John Fawcett . 
 The plot follows Sarah Manning ( played by Tatiana Maslany ) as she continues to impersonate Beth Childs , a woman who looks identical to Sarah , in order to take Beth 's money after seeing her commit suicide . In the episode , Sarah deals with the aftermath of the death of another identical woman , Katja <unk> , and begins to discover more lookalikes . Maslany plays each of the identical women ; " Instinct " marked the first episode in which more than one of Maslany 's characters was present in a single shot , which necessitated specific planning and technology to film and edit these scenes . The episode received positive reviews from critics , who praised the episode 's plot development and Maslany 's performance . 
 = = Plot = = 
 After Katja is shot , Sarah flees in Beth 's car and receives a call from a woman on Beth 's phone . The woman , after hearing that Katja is dead , instructs Sarah to dispose of the body and retrieve Katja 's briefcase . While burying Katja 's body , Sarah finds a hotel key in her pocket and keeps it . She visits her foster brother Felix 's apartment and discovers that the $ 75 @,@ 000 she stole from Beth 's bank account has been taken by Beth 's detective partner Art . When she returns to Beth 's apartment she is surprised to find Beth 's boyfriend , Paul , who seems confused by Sarah 's demeanour but does not realise that she is not Beth . The next day , Sarah prepares to meet Art , and lies that the $ 75 @,@ 000 belongs to Paul , but Art says he will return the money only after the hearing Beth must attend about a suspicious shooting in which she was involved . 
 Sarah disguises herself as Katja and gains entrance to her hotel room in order to find Katja 's briefcase . The room has been ransacked by the time she arrives but a hotel employee gives her the briefcase , which had been left with security . Inside the briefcase Sarah finds medical images , vials of blood , and evidence of more lookalikes , including a woman named Alison Hendrix , whose address is written on a note . Believing Alison to be the woman on the phone , Sarah drives to her address and follows her van to a soccer field , where she discovers that Alison is another of her lookalikes . Alison confronts Sarah , assuming that she is Beth , and refuses to believe Sarah when she explains that Beth killed herself , telling her to leave and wait for another call . 
 At the police station , pretending to be Beth , Sarah manipulates the resident psychiatrist into approving her return to duty , but Art refuses to give Sarah the money until she is fully reinstated . She receives a call from Alison , who tells her to bring the briefcase to her house that night . When Sarah and Felix arrive at Alison 's house , Alison threatens them with a gun before relenting and introducing Sarah to another lookalike named Cosima . 
 = = Production = = 
 " Instinct " was filmed in a block with the series ' first episode , " Natural Selection " , under the direction of Orphan Black co @-@ creator John Fawcett . It was filmed in Canada , although it is never made clear where in North America the show takes place . The episode refers to the fictional suburb of Bailey Downs , where Alison is said to live , which is a homage to the setting of the 2000 Canadian horror film Ginger Snaps , which was directed by Fawcett . One of the filming locations used for the episode was the office used by the show 's writers , which served as Beth 's psychiatrist 's office . 
 The episode featured one of the first scenes in which Maslany plays multiple characters interacting in the same shot . To construct the scene in which Sarah and Alison meet in the soccer field shed , Maslany and her stunt double Kathryn Alexandre first shot a master version of the scene using a <unk> , a programmable camera crane that can memorise camera movements . Two versions of the scene were then re @-@ filmed without Alexandre , with Maslany playing each of the characters . To simulate Alison placing her hand on Sarah 's shoulder , a grip stand was used in the place of Sarah 's shoulder for Maslany to hold when playing Alison , and to simulate Sarah slapping Alison 's arm away , Maslany slapped the air when playing Sarah and reacted as if she had been hit when playing Alison . The final scene was created through digital compositing , whereby both versions of the scene — with Maslany playing both characters separately — are combined to produce a single shot . Maslany felt that , as one of her early attempts at sharing a scene with herself , she over @-@ thought the process : " I think I was trying too hard to get it right . Nobody 's there when you 're shooting these things , so you overcompensate . "

 Overall , " Instinct " was well received by critics . Caroline Framke of The A.V. Club gave the episode an A – grade , writing that the series " continues to walk a fine line with extraordinary subtlety and confidence " . She gave particular praise to Maslany 's acting , saying that she " handles every curveball , new character , and impersonation upon impersonation with extraordinary deftness " . Tor.com 's Robert H. Bedford commended the way the different storylines were integrated and particularly enjoyed the interactions between Art and Sarah . Den of Geek critic Rob Kemp thought that the episode was well developed and felt that it stood out from " the current crop of TV science fiction " . He praised the serious nature of the episode as well as " the effort that has gone into grounding the show into reality " . Simon Cocks of CultBox gave " Instinct " 4 out of 5 stars , describing it as " riveting television " . He found Maslany 's performance " incredible " and " effortless " , and felt that her scenes with Art at the police station provided the strongest material . In a more mixed review for Twitch Film , Todd Brown opined that " Instinct " sometimes crossed " the line between camp and believability " . He praised the development of the story and the characters but felt that while Maslany 's acting was " remarkably strong as both Sarah and Sarah @-@ Being @-@ Beth her performance as Alison ... feels a bit shrill " . 
 = Pilot ( The X @-@ Files ) = 
 " Pilot " is the pilot episode of the science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . The episode aired on September 10 , 1993 on the Fox network in the United States and Canada , and subsequently aired in the United Kingdom and Ireland on Sky1 . The episode was written by series creator Chris Carter , and directed by Robert Mandel . As the pilot , it would set up the mythology storyline for the series . The episode earned a Nielsen rating of 7 @.@ 9 and was viewed by 7 @.@ 4 million households and 12 @.@ 0 million viewers . The episode itself was generally well received by fans and critics alike , which led to a growing cult following for the series before it hit the mainstream . 
 The pilot introduced the two main characters , Fox Mulder and Dana Scully who were portrayed by David Duchovny and Gillian Anderson respectively . The episode also featured William B. Davis , Charles Cioffi and Zachary Ansley as the recurring characters of the Smoking Man , Scott Blevins and Billy Miles . The Smoking Man would go on to become the series ' signature antagonist , appearing in every season except the eighth . The episode follows FBI Special Agents Mulder and Scully on their first X @-@ File case together , investigating a string of deaths which Mulder believes to be alien experiments . 
 Inspired by Kolchak : The Night Stalker , the series was conceived by Chris Carter in an attempt to " scare people 's pants off " . When creating the characters of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully , Carter decided to play against established stereotypes , making the male character a believer and the female a skeptic , as the latter role had traditionally been a male one on television . Principal photography for " Pilot " took place over fourteen days during March 1993 ; using a budget of $ 2 million , the scenes were filmed in and around the Vancouver area . Vancouver would remain the area for production for the next five years , although production would move to Los Angeles from the beginning of the sixth season at the behest of David Duchovny . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In Bellefleur , Oregon , teenager Karen Swenson is seen fleeing through the forest . When she falls , a dark figure approaches , and they both become enveloped in light . Swenson 's body is later found by Bellefleur detectives , with two small marks on her back . 
 Later , in Washington , D.C. , FBI special agent Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) is summoned to a meeting with Division Chief Scott Blevins ( Charles Cioffi ) and a seemingly anonymous government official , The Smoking Man ( William B. Davis ) . Scully is assigned to work with Special Agent Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) on the X @-@ Files , an obscure FBI section covering purportedly paranormal cases . Blevins has assigned Scully for the implicit purpose of using her scientific knowledge to discredit Mulder 's work , although Blevins never directly tells Scully this and is evasive when she asks if such is his intent . 
 Scully introduces herself to her new partner , who shows her evidence from the Swenson case . He notes that she was the fourth member of her high school class to die under mysterious circumstances . Mulder also notes an unknown chemical compound found on Swenson 's body , as well as similarities between her death and others from across the country . Mulder believes that Swenson 's death is due to extraterrestrial activity . However , the skeptical Scully expresses disbelief in Mulder 's theory . 
 When Mulder and Scully 's plane flies over Bellefleur , it encounters unexplained turbulence . As they drive in the woods near the town , the agents ' car radio malfunctions ; Mulder marks the spot of this event by spray @-@ painting an " X " onto the road . Mulder arranges for the exhumation of the third victim , Ray Soames , despite the protests of Dr. Jay Nemman , the county medical examiner . When Soames ' coffin is opened , a deformed body is found inside , which Scully concludes is not Soames , but an orangutan . However , she finds a metal implant in the body 's nasal cavity . 
 Mulder and Scully visit the psychiatric hospital where Soames was committed before his death and meet two of Soames ' former classmates — the comatose Billy Miles ( Zachary Ansley ) ; and the wheelchair @-@ using Peggy O 'Dell . O 'Dell suffers from a nosebleed during the agents ' visit , and is seen to bear marks similar to Swenson 's . Outside the hospital , Mulder explains to Scully that he believes Miles , O 'Dell , and the victims to be alien abductees . 
 That night , the agents investigate the forest ; Scully discovers strange ash on the ground , leading her to suspect cult activity . However , a local detective arrives and orders them to leave . Driving back to their motel , Mulder and Scully encounter a flash of light at the spot their car had malfunctioned earlier . When the car loses power , Mulder realizes that nine minutes disappeared after the flash , a phenomenon reported by alien abductees . 
 At the motel , Mulder tells Scully that his sister Samantha vanished when he was twelve , which has driven his work in the paranormal . The agents receive an anonymous call telling them that O 'Dell was killed in traffic while on foot . They visit the scene , finding O 'Dell 's body and no wheelchair . They return to find the motel on fire and their evidence destroyed . Nemman 's daughter Theresa contacts the agents for help . She tells them that she has awakened in the middle of the woods several times , though her father and Detective Miles arrive and take her away . 
 Mulder and Scully return to the cemetery to exhume the other victims only to find the graves already dug up and the coffins missing . Mulder realizes that Billy Miles is responsible for bringing the victims to the woods . Returning to the woods , they again encounter Detective Miles , but hear a scream and find Billy nearby with Theresa in his arms . There is a flash of light , and Billy and Theresa are recovered unharmed . 
 Several months later , Miles is put under hypnosis . He recalls how he and his classmates were abducted in the forest as they celebrated their graduation ; they were subjected to tests by the aliens , and killed when the tests failed . Scully provides Blevins with the metal implant , the only remaining piece of evidence . However , she later learns from Mulder that Miles ' case files are missing . Meanwhile , The Smoking Man stores the implant away in a vast evidence room within the Pentagon .

 When conceiving the episode , Chris Carter wanted to " scare people 's pants off " . A noted influence on the episode 's conception was Kolchak : The Night Stalker , a series from the 1970s . This led to an idea of two agents investigating paranormal events . When creating the characters of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully , Carter decided to play against established stereotypes , making the male character a believer and the female a skeptic , as the latter role had traditionally been a male one on television . 
 When casting the actors for the two main parts , Carter had difficulties finding an actor for Scully . When he cast Gillian Anderson for the part , the network wanted to replace her . Carter believed they responded negatively towards the casting because " she didn 't have the obvious qualities that network executives have come to associate with hit shows " . Calling her a " terrific actress " , Carter reacted overall positively towards Anderson 's audition saying " she came in and read the part with a seriousness and intensity that I knew the Scully character had to have and I knew [ ... ] she was the right person for the part " . David Duchovny on the other hand , was met with more positive response from the network , Carter even saying he was an " early favorite " . William B. Davis , who made his first appearance as the recurring villain The Smoking Man in this episode , had originally auditioned for a larger part in the episode , saying " I auditioned for the senior FBI agent who had three lines . I didn 't get that part — I got the part with no lines " .

 Principal photography for " Pilot " took place over fourteen days during March 1993 ; using a budget of $ 2 million . Filming of the episode took place in and around Vancouver , British Columbia . The series would use the area for production for the next five years , although production would move to Los Angeles from the beginning of the sixth season at the behest of David Duchovny . 
 The scene set in the town 's graveyard was shot in Queen Elizabeth Park , marking the first time the location had been used to represent a graveyard ; the location would later be used for the same purpose in the fourth season episode " Kaddish " . The interior shots of the psychiatric hospital were filmed in a disused building owned by Riverview Hospital in Coquitlam , and marked the first time that the crew met with producer R. W. Goodwin . The episode 's final warehouse scene was filmed in a document warehouse belonging to the headquarters of the Canadian television network Knowledge . An office in the same building was also used for the boardroom meeting at the beginning of the episode . The scenes involving the Smoking Man required special permission to be filmed , in order to allow for actor William B. Davis to smoke in a public building . All of the interior shots of the FBI headquarters were filmed in the main newsroom of the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation , as the production crew found that the open plan offices they wished to represent no longer existed , having typically been converted into cubicles . However , it was found that working around the CBC 's broadcast schedule was too unwieldy , and later episodes of the series replicated the location on a sound stage . The forest scenes were shot on location in Lynn Valley , in the Lower Seymour Conservation Reserve — formerly known as the Seymour Demonstration Forest . The crew spent $ 9 @,@ 000 building wooden pathways for equipment , cast and crew to move easily through the area . Additional scenes were filmed at the headquarters for BC Hydro ; whilst Scully 's apartment was represented by a location used only in this episode and the third episode , " Squeeze " — use of this location was discontinued once it became apparent that most reverse angles would show a large car park across the street . 
 Make @-@ up effects artist Toby Lindala was tasked with creating a prop which would allow actress Sarah Koskoff to simulate a nosebleed on @-@ camera , rather than through the use of off @-@ screen make @-@ up and editing tricks . However , during test shots , the prop 's tubing burst , causing the stage blood to begin dripping down Koskoff 's forehead , rather than from her nose . Gillian Anderson has expressed displeasure over the scene in which her character , Dana Scully , visits Fox Mulder in his motel room in her underwear to have him examine a suspicious wound which turns out to be insect bites . The actress felt that the scene was too gratuitous , saying " there really wasn 't a reason for it . The bites could have been on my shoulder or something . " However , Carter has explained that the scene was simply intended to highlight the platonic relationship between the two lead roles .

 Post @-@ production work on the episode was finished by May 1993 , with the final version of the episode being assembled only three hours before its preview screening for the network 's executives . Stock footage of the exterior of the J. Edgar Hoover Building was added to the episode , although later episodes would film new exterior shots using Simon Fraser University as a stand @-@ in location . The climactic abduction scene featuring Billy Miles in a forest clearing featured a swirling vortex of leaves created using computer imagery by the series ' visual designer Mat Beck ; which Carter has described as being more complicated to achieve than the Normandy landings .

 The original script gives more insight into Scully 's visit to Scott Blevins ' office . The scene that introduces Scully in the script is set just before her visit and takes place at the FBI Academy in Quantico , Virginia , where she teaches a small group of trainees about the physiology of homicide , specifically electrocution and death by cattle prod . Her attention is distracted by an agent who enters the room and hands her a note that reads , " Your attendance is required in Washington at 1600 <unk> sharp " . Scully checks her digital watch , which reads 1 : 03 . The majority , at the least , of this scene was actually filmed but the scene was omitted from the final version of the episode . The next scene is that in which Scully reports to the receptionist at FBI headquarters ; the script includes Scully showing her badge to the receptionist and dialogue for the role of the receptionist as she tells Scully , " See Section Chief Blevins . Third floor , violent crime division . " In the final version of the episode , Scully 's badge does not appear in any of the scenes and the receptionist does not speak . 
 Two filmed scenes were cut from the final version of the episode . Both featured Tim Ransom as Scully 's boyfriend Ethan Minette . In the first , Minette and Scully meet , with Scully cancelling plans for a holiday the two had arranged , due to her assignment to the Oregon case . The second scene briefly shows Scully answering a telephone call from Mulder whilst asleep in bed with Minette , though the latter has no dialogue . The addition of Scully 's boyfriend was an attempt by the Fox executives to create the romantic interest that they felt was not there between Mulder and Scully . Chris Carter ultimately found that it was " very easy " to remove the character from the episode , both because his appearances seemed to slow down the scenes in which Mulder and Scully are together and due to the fact that Carter found Scully 's relationship with her FBI partner to actually be more interesting and exciting than her relationship with her boyfriend .

 " Pilot " premiered on the Fox network on September 10 , 1993 , and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC Two on September 19 , 1994 . The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 7 @.@ 9 , with a 15 share , meaning that roughly 7 @.@ 9 percent of all television @-@ equipped households , and 15 percent of households watching television , were tuned in to the episode . It was viewed by 7 @.@ 4 million households and 12 @.@ 0 million viewers . 
 " Pilot " was well received by several of the series ' future crew members . Producer and writer Glen Morgan felt that the episode 's " merging of Silence of the Lambs and Close Encounters of the Third Kind " was impressive ; he also felt that it was the only truly scary series on television at the time . Writer Howard Gordon stated that " the pilot set the tone of the show really successfully " , noting the difficulty inherent in introducing both a series ' premise and its main cast in " forty @-@ eight minutes " and finding that the episode had achieved both , being " a tremendous synthesis of all the parts " . Chris Carter also recounted that the episode 's test screening for Rupert Murdoch and other Fox executives was met with " spontaneous applause " . 
 The episode was generally well received by fans and critics alike . Variety magazine criticized the episode for " using reworked concepts " , but praised the production and noted its potential . Of the acting , Variety stated , " Duchovny 's delineation of a serious scientist with a sense of humor should win him partisans , and Anderson 's wavering doubter connects well . They 're a solid team ... " . Variety also praised the writing and direction : " Mandel 's cool direction of Carter 's ingenious script and the artful presentation itself give TV sci @-@ fi a boost . " The magazine concluded , " Carter 's dialogue is fresh without being self @-@ conscious , and the characters are involving . Series kicks off with drive and imagination , both innovative in recent TV . " Entertainment Weekly noted that Scully " was set up as a scoffing skeptic " in the pilot but progressed toward belief throughout the season . After the airing of just four episodes , the magazine called The X @-@ Files " the most paranoid , subversive show on TV " , noting the " marvelous tension between Anderson — who is dubious about these events — and Duchovny , who has the haunted , imploring look of a true believer " . Keith Phipps , writing for The A.V. Club , praised the episode , rating it an A – . He felt that the episode 's premise worked well to " set a template " for future episodes , and noted that the chemistry between Duchovny and Anderson was " already there " from the outset . Matt Haigh , writing for Den of Geek , reviewed the episode positively , praising the chemistry between the lead roles and the quality of the script . In 2012 , SFX named it the tenth best TV pilot in the science fiction and fantasy genre , saying that it " brought us everything we came to expect from the show " . The plot for " Pilot " was also adapted as a novel for young adults in 1995 by Les Martin , under the title X Marks the Spot . 
 = ODB + + = 
 ODB + + is a proprietary CAD @-@ to @-@ CAM data exchange format used in the design and manufacture of electronic devices . Its purpose is to exchange printed circuit board design information between design and manufacturing and between design tools from different EDA / <unk> vendors . It was originally developed by Valor Computerized Systems , Ltd . ( acquired in 2010 by Mentor Graphics ) as the job description format for their CAM system . 
 ODB stands for open database , but its openness is disputed , as discussed below . The ' + + ' suffix , evocative of C + + , was added in 1997 with the addition of component descriptions . There are two versions of ODB + + : the original ( now controlled by Mentor ) and an XML version called ODB + + ( X ) that Valor developed and donated to the IPC organization in an attempt to merge GenCAM ( IPC @-@ 2511 ) and ODB + + into Offspring ( IPC @-@ <unk> ) . 
 = = Introduction = = 
 Inside almost every electronic device is a PCB onto which the semiconductor and other components are mechanically and electrically connected by soldering . These PCBs are designed using a computer @-@ aided design ( CAD ) system . To physically realize the design , the computerized design information must be transferred to a <unk> computer @-@ aided manufacturing ( CAM ) system . Since the CAD and CAM systems are generally produced by different companies , they have to agree on a CAD @-@ to @-@ CAM data exchange format to transfer the data . ODB + + is one such file format for performing this transfer . Other formats are compared and contrasted below . After the bare board is manufactured , the electronic components are placed and soldered , for example by SMT placement equipment and wave or <unk> soldering . 
 = = File structure = = 
 When in use , ODB + + data is stored in a hierarchy of files and file folders . However , for transmission it is convenient to use common operating system commands that create a single , compressed file that preserves the hierarchy information . For example , on Unix tar and <unk> commands can be used . In ODB + + ( X ) , the database is contained in a single XML file by default . 
 ODB + + covers the specification of not only conductor layer artwork and drill data , but also material stack up , <unk> with test points , component bill of materials , component placement , fabrication data , and dimension data .

 Valor was founded in 1992 and it released ODB in 1995 . It added the + + suffix when component names were added in 1997 . The XML version was developed beginning 2000 , and ended in 2008 with the donation to IPC . Valor was acquired by Mentor in 2010 .

 In the late 1990s it became clear to industry participants that a second @-@ generation data transfer format would be more efficient than the prevalent , first @-@ generation Gerber format . However , it was very difficult to reach a consensus over which of two candidates should be selected : 
 ODB + + : proven but proprietary 
 IPC @-@ 2511 GenCAM : not widely used but open 
 In 2002 , a compromise format , ODB + + ( X ) , was recommended by National Electronics Manufacturing Initiative ( <unk> ; an industry body , subsequently renamed International Electronics Manufacturing Initiative , <unk> ) after a two @-@ year mediation effort between the GenCAM and ODB + + camps . Companies that supported the recommendation at the time included Cadence , Hewlett @-@ Packard , Lucent , <unk> , Mentor ( which acquired Valor some eight years later ) , Nokia and Xerox . But in fact adoption to date has been minimal . As a result , and as detailed below , the industry is still divided . 
 = = = Advocacy = = = 
 Lists of EDA tools that support import and / or export of ODB + + have been compiled by Artwork Conversion Software , Mentor itself , and on the Comparison of EDA packages table . Some companies that have adopted the ODB + + format are advocates for its use . Streamline Circuits reports that ODB + + provides much greater efficiency than the competing Gerber format , stating that " an 8 @-@ layer printed circuit board can take up to 5 hours to plan and tool using Gerber and only 1 hour when using ODB + + . " According to Streamline , manufacturers are adopting it to overcome the limitations of the simpler Gerber format . <unk> Technologies calls ODB + + " the <unk> standard for intelligent data exchange in EDA " In 2002 , Dana Korf of <unk> / SCI called ODB + + " the prevalent non @-@ Gerber format . " Kent <unk> of <unk> , states of ODB + + " ... really we don ’ t need anything else . "

 Ucamco , the developers of the Gerber format , argue that the prevalent Gerber @-@ based flow ( with some additions ) can be as complete and efficient as ODB + + . 
 = = = = Concerns = = = = 
 ODB + + is a proprietary format controlled by Valor and now Mentor , and so , like all proprietary standards , it comes with the risk of vendor lock @-@ in . CAD companies had some concerns about this when ODB + + was controlled by Valor , a CAM company , but these concerns were magnified when a rival CAD company , Mentor , acquired Valor . Although Mentor claims that it " ... openly supports inclusion of ODB + + and updates for other EDA tool vendors , " it used to restrict access to the specification and required a non @-@ disclosure agreement . The application form used to include a requirement to : " ... <unk> a customer need for this integration through references from mutual customers . Provide a recommendation from a Mentor Graphics product division or demonstrate the incremental value of this integration to both Mentor Graphics and the partner company . " Some direct competitors inferred this meant restricted access . This was a source of frustration not only for competitors but also for the Mentor user community . 
 In 2012 , Julian Coates , director of business development at Mentor 's Valor division claimed that , so far , all ODB + + partners , including competitors to Mentor , who have applied for assistance to build and maintain ODB + + interfaces via the ODB + + Solutions Alliance have been accepted without reservation or cost . In addition , the format specification is now openly available via the ODB + + Solutions Alliance without the need for NDA . Membership of the ODB + + Solutions Alliance is free of charge and open to anybody who registers . A no @-@ charge ODB + + Viewer and other software utilities are available to registrants . 
 = = = = Potential resolution = = = = 
 Critics of the proprietary nature of ODB + + point to several more open formats as models for a future consensus format : 
 RS @-@ <unk> ( " extended Gerber format " ) : Although it is nominally proprietary to Ucamco , the specification can be downloaded freely making it de facto an open standard . 
 IPC @-@ 2511 ( " GenCAM " ) which resulted from a donation of certain technologies by <unk> / <unk> to IPC . 
 IPC @-@ <unk> ( " Offspring " ) an attempt to merge GenCAM with ODB + + ( X ) . The specification can be downloaded freely . In 2011 , an industry consortium was created to support it , motivated in part by frustration with the proprietary nature of ODB + + . Cadence Design Systems , <unk> , Artwork Conversion Software and the owners of Gerber format , Ucamco , joined it , but , initially , not Mentor . However , in 2012 , Mentor did join . This , combined with the 2012 announcement by <unk> that it would join the ODB + + Solutions Alliance , creates the possibility that PCB designers will have a choice of format no matter which EDA tool they choose .

 = Thomas Trueblood = 
 Thomas Clarkson Trueblood ( April 6 , 1856 – June 5 , 1951 ) was an American professor of elocution and oratory and the first coach of the University of Michigan golf and debate teams . He was affiliated with the University of Michigan for 67 years from 1884 to 1951 , and was a nationally known writer and speaker on oratory and debate . He founded UM 's Department of Elocution and Oratory as well as the campus debate program . He became the subject of national media attention in 1903 when the Chicago Tribune ran an article stating that he was offering a new " course in love making . " His golf teams won two NCAA National Championships and five Big Ten Conference championships . He was posthumously inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor in 1981 . 
 = = Professor of Elocution and Oratory = = 
 Trueblood was a native of Salem , Indiana . He attended Earlham College in Richmond , Indiana and received an A.M. degree . In 1878 , Trueblood and Robert I. Fulton established the Fulton and Trueblood School of Oratory in Kansas City , Missouri , which became " one of the largest and best known institutions of its kind in the United States . " In 1884 , Trueblood came to Ann Arbor as a lecturer on public speaking , intending to give a six @-@ week course . The next year he was invited back . At the time he also was lecturing at Missouri , Kentucky and Ohio Wesleyan , and working out of Fulton and Trueblood School . Michigan asked him to join the faculty , and he stayed for 67 years . In 1892 , he founded the Department of Elocution and Oratory and became its first chairman . Michigan 's Oratory and Elocution Department was the first such unit in any major university or college in the country . He also established the first credit course in speech at any American university . At the turn of the century , speech and oratory played an important role in American society and academia , so much so that Trueblood was the highest paid professor on the University of Michigan faculty , and students were required to take Trueblood 's courses . 
 In addition , Trueblood organized and coached the competitive debate and oratory contests at Michigan . He established the Northern Oratorical League , and later the Central Debating League , for the purpose of conducting competitive debates among Midwestern Universities , including Michigan , the University of Chicago , Northwestern , Oberlin College , Iowa , and Minnesota . In 1903 , an Iowa newspaper noted : " It was due to his zeal in organization , his success in persuading students to enter the competitive contests , and his skill in drilling them , that has enabled Michigan to take so high a rank in oratory in these league contests , with seven first honors to her credit in ten years , and nine of the twelve victories in debate . " 
 Trueblood also delivered speeches and gave dramatic readings on tours all over the world . One newspaper noted : " As a reader Prof. Trueblood is well known throughout the west . His readings are taken from the best literature , with special attention to Shakespearean work . It is his plan to give the principal scenes of the play , narrating the unimportant parts , thus providing an entertainment acceptable to those who do not attend the theater . " After a performance of Hamlet in 1908 , an Iowa newspaper wrote : " Prof. Trueblood is a man of remarkable personality . His cuttings of the play were taken from the most dramatic parts , giving a wide range of understanding of all the characters . Not only were the different parts interpreted with extremely keen judgment of the most real kind , but the speaker introduced each division with a brief description and delineation of the men and women who appeared . Prof. Trueblood 's manner of speaking and his diction are acquirements of a very high character and he held the interest of his hearers from beginning to end . " 
 Trueblood was president of the National Association of <unk> when they met in June 1899 for their annual convention at Chautauqua Institute , New York . He brought with him Charles Casper Simons , a law student who coached the debate team for Trueblood . Simons had won first honors in a speech contest with his oration on abolitionist John Brown . Knowing that Southern <unk> would be in attendance , Trueblood asked Simons to deliver his tribute to Brown at the conference . One account of the conference states : " The introduction was delivered without much reaction ; but when Simons intoned , ' The South had slain the man , but the spirit which animated him was beyond the reach of earthly power , ' the Southerners were distressed . Simons went on to proclaim that John Brown ' taught the South that a new era had begun , that not by persuasion , threat or rant , but by force was slavery to be exterminated . ' The Southern members of the association walked out of the amphitheater in angry protest . "

 In the early 1900s , Michigan 's athletic teams ( and those throughout the country ) were re @-@ segregated . While George Jewett had played for the Michigan football team in 1890 and 1892 , the next African @-@ American to play on the football team was Willis Ward , forty years later in 1932 . During this period of athletic segregation , an African @-@ American , Eugene Joseph Marshall , was permitted to compete in Trueblood 's debate competitions and won the university debate championship in 1903 . The Ann Arbor Argus reported : " For the first time in the history of American universities , a colored man has won his highest honors in oratory in fair and free competition with all comers . The announcement of his victory will be read with pleasure by all who are working for the betterment of the colored race . " Trueblood entertained Marshall at his home and presented him with the Chicago Alumni Medal . Marshall subsequently placed second in the Midwest regional collegiate competition . 
 = = The Jam Handy incident = = 
 In May 1903 , Trueblood became the subject of national media attention as a result of a newspaper article written by a 17 @-@ year @-@ old freshman student claiming Trueblood was teaching a new " course in lovemaking . " The student , Jam Handy , was a campus correspondent for the Chicago Tribune . In the class , Trueblood taught " the delivery of short extracts from masterpieces of oratory . " One such extract involved a scene from a play in which a man kneels in front of a woman pleading for her hand . In his 1893 textbook Practical Elements of Elocution , Trueblood used the scene to illustrate the " aspirate explosive " form of speech . 
 After watching Trueblood act out the kneeling scene , Handy wrote an article that was published on the front page of the Chicago Tribune on May 8 , 1903 , with a headline stating : " Learn Sly Cupid 's Tricks ; Students at Ann Arbor Take Lessons in Love Making . " The article suggested that Trueblood was instructing his male students on romance rather than oratory technique . The next day , the Chicago Record @-@ Herald published a three @-@ panel cartoon of " Professor Foxy <unk> " dreaming up ways to " teach his class how to properly make love . " Newspapers across the country picked up the story . The Daily Northwestern wrote : " Professor Trueblood of Michigan University has inaugurated a course in love making , his motive being to stimulate interest in his classes . The oratorical students are compelled to kneel and make fervid declarations to lady students . " The Newark Advocate 's headline read : " <unk> Lessons : Novel Course In the University of Michigan ; Sly Cupid 's Tricks Taught . " The Salt Lake Tribune reported : 
 " Lessons in <unk> . The University of Michigan has added a new course to the curriculum , one that may best be styled a course in love making . Prof. Trueblood is the inventor of the novel scheme , and his course , which has been hitherto shunned as one of the toughest at the university , now seems likely to become the most popular on campus ... Early this week he hit upon the successful plan , and now the many visitors who attend his classes are spectators of thrilling love scenes . Fifty times a day Prof. Trueblood is forced to kneel to some maiden and show his pupils the right way to declare their devotion to their sweethearts ... Each budding orator takes his place before a blushing maid , and no matter how smoothly the pair may have progressed in private the professor finds some fault with the public demonstration . ' No , kneel on both knees — now hold her hand , it impresses her more @-@ so , ' and the old professor again kneels and goes through it all over again . " 
 On May 12 , the Chicago Tribune ran a photograph of Trueblood with the caption : " Trueblood has nearly worn out his trousers at the knees , showing young men how to kneel , and has strained his voice and eyes in efforts to show his pupils how to throw fire and passion into their appeals . " 
 The story was an embarrassment for Trueblood and the university . In his memoirs , Handy recalled being summoned to Trueblood 's office : " His desk was piled high with letters ... and clippings ... from around the country ... and he also had a copy of the McCutcheon cartoon . ( He ) was taking all of this as ridicule , although I had publicized the story with sincere enthusiasm for a new advance in education of which I felt the University of Michigan should be proud . " The faculty voted unanimously to suspend Handy for a year for " publishing false and injurious statements affecting the character of the work of one of the Professors . " In addition to the suspension , Handy was charged as a " faker " in the press : 
 Henry J. Handy , the student @-@ correspondent at the University of Michigan who sent a sensational story to the Chicago newspapers , relating how Professor Thomas C. Trueblood had a class in love @-@ making , has been suspended for one year and the story has been branded as a ' fake . ' Handy based the story on an incident that occurred during the rehearsal of a drama , when Professor Trueblood showed one of the students how to kneel to propose . 
 Shortly after the incident , Trueblood left for a trip giving dramatic readings on the West Coast . Handy went on to become a successful public relations man . 
 = = Golf coach = = 
 Trueblood was the faculty tennis champion , but at age 40 his doctor told him to give up the game because it was too strenuous . He took up golf , and enjoyed success in that sport , too . " I took it up in August and in October I won the Ann Arbor Golf Club championship , " he said . In 1901 , Trueblood organized the first Michigan golf team . On October 24 – 25 , 1902 , Michigan defeated the University of Chicago 16 @-@ 12 in " the first intercollegiate golf match held in the West . " 
 In 1921 , golf became a varsity sport , and Trueblood was the school 's first official coach . In 1926 , Trueblood retired as a professor emeritus at age 70 . At that time , he turned his attention full @-@ time to coaching . His coaching record at Michigan was 71 @-@ 9 @-@ 2 . During his 15 official seasons as golf coach , his teams won two NCAA National Championships ( 1934 @-@ 1935 ) and five Big Ten Conference championships ( 1932 @-@ 1936 ) , and were Big Ten runners @-@ up eight times . He coached two NCAA individual champions , John Fischer ( 1932 ) and Chuck Kocsis ( 1936 ) . Trueblood continued as golf coach until he was 80 , when athletic director Fielding H. Yost named him emeritus coach . 
 In 1932 , Chuck Kocsis ( the first golfer inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor ) , enrolled at the university . When a promised alumni pledge to pay his expenses fell through , Trueblood agreed to make a loan ( at five percent interest ) so Kocsis could pay his tuition . The Wolverines with Kocsis won the NCAA championship twice . Kocsis recalled that the team often traveled to tournaments in Trueblood 's car . " Professor Trueblood had a seven @-@ passenger Buick , " Kocsis said . " He designated me as the chauffeur . So if we had a golf match , we 'd all get into the car and go to Chicago , or go to Ohio , wherever we were going to play . " Another teammate recalled the trips in Trueblood 's car : " It wasn 't a very big Buick , as I recall . We rode with six guys . Chuck used to do most of the driving . I remember that trip down to Washington ( for the 1935 national championship at Congressional , which Michigan won ) . We started in the morning and drove all the way down there . Professor Trueblood was a big guy , too . " Trueblood took the team on a side trip to Mount Vernon , where one of the players accidentally bumped the shifter into gear and hit the accelerator as he exited Trueblood 's car . The car lurched forward ; the open door hit something and was torn off its hinges . 
 Ralph M. Cole , a member of the golf team of 1926 @-@ 1928 , later wrote of a humorous incident involving the septuagenarian Coach Trueblood . Cole recalled : " As golf coach he could add very little about the mechanics of the game . But he added one piece of advice which was very helpful when followed , and which he drilled into us at every practice session . It was : ' Up and out in two , boys . ' As any golfer would know , it meant , when hitting a short approach shot , get it close enough to the pin to make the next putt . Now for the humorous part of that admonition . We had played Purdue in Lafayette on a Thursday and were to play Illinois on Friday . The Professor was to call us at 4 : 30 a.m. to catch a 5 : 30 train for Urbana . Well , he got confused on our room number and awakened a man who called the front desk and told the night clerk that there must be some nut calling at 4 : 30 a.m. and shouting , ' Up and out in two boys ! ' We did make the train , anyway . " 
 A.H. Jolly , Jr . , captain of the 1933 golf team , noted : " Truby , as he was referred to when out of earshot , was still a most active and attentive coach . But the only club or clubs I recall seeing him handle in those days , was a Left @-@ Handed Putter ! " 
 = = Death and honors = = 
 Trueblood died in Bradenton , Florida in 1951 at age 95 . At the time , the Associated Press noted : " He pioneered the teaching of speech in the nation 's colleges during his 42 years on the University of Michigan faculty . " His brother , Professor Edwin P. Trueblood , also a speech professor at Earlham College , died earlier the same year . Thomas Trueblood 's obituary reported that he " devised the famous college cheer ' The Locomotive . ' " He devised the University 's famous " locomotive " cheer in 1903 while returning to Ann Arbor on a train from a Big Ten football game . However , other sources indicate that the locomotive cheer began at Princeton in the 1890s . 
 Trueblood 's papers are at the Bentley Historical Library in Ann Arbor . Trueblood has been the subject of two articles by Linda Robinson Walker in the University of Michigan alumni publication Michigan Today . Much of the factual information in this article is distilled from Walker 's articles . 
 In 1921 , students of Professor Trueblood honored him by establishing the Trueblood Fund . Today , the Trueblood Fellowship is open to students majoring in Screen Arts & Cultures . In 1981 , Trueblood was inducted into the University of Michigan Athletic Hall of Honor as part of the fourth induction class . The Trueblood Theater was located in the Henry S. Frieze Building at the University of Michigan School of Music , Theater and Dance and named in Trueblood 's honor . The Trueblood Theater closed its doors in 2006 when the Frieze Building was razed to make room for the North Quad Residential and Academic Complex . 
 A portrait of Trueblood painted in 1920 by Merton <unk> was originally hung first in Alumni Hall ( now the Museum of Art ) and then in the Theater Library in the Frieze Building . In 1998 , the Trueblood portrait was hung at the University of Michigan Golf Course . At the time of the installation , the University Record noted : " Known as ' Chief ' to his teaching associates and ' <unk> ' to his students , Thomas C. Trueblood now resides among U @-@ M 's golf history . "

 Series creator Chris Carter explained that the cast listing for the episode , along with " Patient X " was " longer than most cast lists you 'll ever see on a TV series " . In order to allow for the increased expenses of hiring additional actors , Carter and the producers of the series talked Fox into allowing the episodes to be slightly more expensive because they would lead into the soon @-@ to @-@ be @-@ released X @-@ Files movie . Carter explained , " we convinced them to spend the extra money to do this extra special work because it was all leading up to [ ... ] when the X @-@ Files movie would be released . " In addition , the child he gave the message to was a young boy and the son of production manager J.P. Finn . Rob Bowman originally intended to direct the episode but , due to reshoots , he was unable to do it , resulting in Carter directing . Bowman later recounted , " I was supposed to direct ' The Red and the Black ' [ … ] but we were prepping for the reshoots [ of The X @-@ Files movie ] so I couldn 't do it . [ … ] Chris had to direct this episode . He was so mad at me . " When filming the scene where Mulder and Scully go to a medic station , Carter made homage to the medical drama ER , filming it entirely with a Steadicam . 
 The opening scene was filmed at Grouse Mountain , above the city of Vancouver , Canada . Most of the scenes at the Ruskin Dam were shot approximately 50 miles east of Vancouver , while the abduction sequence involved a full @-@ scale replica of the dam . The various scenes with the Syndicate testing the black oil vaccine on Marita Covarrubias were filmed at an abandoned hospital in Vancouver . Carter commented that they chose it because it had " an interesting observation space above it that we used " , which was difficult to shoot in .

 " The Red and the Black " was a technically difficult episode , which Carter later described , along with " Patient X " , as " the most challenging and logically complex projects of the season . " The scene where Cassandra Spender was elevated into the colonist craft was shot by having a stuntwoman sit in Cassandra 's wheelchair and be lifted upward via a crane , which was removed from the shot during post @-@ production . The lights of the alien spacecraft were shot using a lighting rig combined with computer effects by Special Effects Supervisor Laurie <unk> @-@ George . The crashed alien spacecraft was sixty feet in diameter , twice the length of any other spaceship seen before on the show , and dragged along the ground to create a <unk> . Twenty @-@ five explosions were set off to simulate the saucer crash ; the remains of the wreckage were then burned to create the rest of the footage . The scene took an entire night to film . 
 The opening scene featuring the alien rebels incinerating a group of Russian alien abductees was filmed without actual Russian cars . Picture car coordination <unk> Habgood noted , " I couldn 't get real Russian cars , so I decided to get creative and go seriously European . We burned a couple <unk> , and a BMW 2002 . I 'm sorry we couldn 't get any <unk> . " For the scene after the intro wherein Mulder discovers the charred remains of abductees , the prop and the production design departments had to create specialized fake bodies . Carter later noted that it 's " harder than it looks to create a charred , dead body . " The stage for the alien abduction scene was built from scratch : construction supervisor Rob Maier was tasked with creating a full @-@ scale replica of the Ruskin Dam bridge in order to ease up the shots . The tagline for this episode is " Resist or Serve " . The tagline was later used for The X @-@ Files game , The X @-@ Files : Resist or Serve as well as the official book covering the fifth season of the show . The list of victims viewed by Scully in her hospital room was made up of X @-@ Files staffers .

 " The Red and the Black " premiered on the Fox network in the United States on March 8 , 1998 . This episode earned a Nielsen rating of 12 @.@ 0 , with an 18 share , meaning that roughly 12 @.@ 0 percent of all television @-@ equipped households , and 18 percent of households watching television , were tuned in to the episode . It was viewed by 19 @.@ 98 million viewers . The episode was later included on The X @-@ Files Mythology , Volume 3 – Colonization , a DVD collection that contains episodes involved with the alien Colonist 's plans to take over the earth . 
 Critical reception to the episode was largely positive . The A.V. Club reviewer Zack Handlen gave " The Red and the Black " an A – , and wrote positively of the " galactic war " between the colonists and the rebels that is referenced in the episode , noting that it marked the point where " shit is about to get real " . Despite this , Handlen criticized the series for not following through on its tale of alien war , noting that the premise " never really [ took off ] <unk> least [ … ] I 've never heard anyone refer to [ the last seasons of the show ] as ' the seasons when the The X @-@ Files mythology finally paid off . ' " Handlen , however noted that " The Red and the Black " worked because " the performances are great as always , and because the second part of this two parter rarely feels bogged down or draggy . " Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode three stars out of five . The two called the episode a " typical mythology runaround " and noted that the plot was " complicated but the simpler scenes of confrontation are very well handled . " Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a positive review and awarded it three stars out of four . Vitaris praised the episode 's premise and wrote that it represented " a second half of a two @-@ parter that is as strong as the first half . " 
 A variety of critics praised the hypnotism scene . Robert Shearman called the scene " gorgeous " and praised Gillian Anderson 's acting abilities . Paula Vitaris was extremely impressed with the scene 's blocking , calling the rendition " virtually orgasmic in intensity " and concluded that " Anderson is marvelous " . 
 = Port Authority of New York and New Jersey = 
 The Port Authority of New York and New Jersey ( PANYNJ ) is a joint venture between the U.S. states of New York and New Jersey , established in 1921 through an interstate compact authorized by the United States Congress . The Port Authority oversees much of the regional transportation infrastructure , including bridges , tunnels , airports , and seaports , within the geographical jurisdiction of the Port of New York and New Jersey . This 1 @,@ 500 @-@ square @-@ mile ( 3 @,@ 900 km ² ) port district is generally encompassed within a 25 @-@ mile ( 40 km ) radius of the Statue of Liberty National Monument . The Port Authority is headquartered at 4 World Trade Center . 
 The Port Authority operates the Port Newark @-@ Elizabeth Marine Terminal , which handled the third @-@ largest volume of shipping among all ports in the United States in 2004 and the largest on the Eastern Seaboard . The Port Authority also operates Hudson River crossings , including the Holland Tunnel , Lincoln Tunnel , and George Washington Bridge connecting New Jersey with Manhattan , and three crossings that connect New Jersey with Staten Island . The Port Authority Bus Terminal and the PATH rail system are also run by the Port Authority , as well as LaGuardia Airport , John F. Kennedy International Airport , Newark Liberty International Airport , Teterboro Airport , Stewart International Airport and Atlantic City International Airport . The agency has its own 1 @,@ 600 @-@ member Port Authority Police Department . 
 Although the Port Authority manages much of the transportation infrastructure in the area , most bridges , tunnels , and other transportation facilities are not included . The New York City Department of Transportation is responsible for the Staten Island Ferry and for the majority of bridges in the city . The Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority is responsible for other bridges and tunnels in the area . New York City Transit Authority buses and subways , Metro North and Long Island Rail Road ( all four are divisions of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority ) , and buses , commuter rail , and light rail operated by NJ Transit are also independent of PANYNJ .

 = = History = = 
 The Port of New York and New Jersey comprised the main point of embarkation for U.S. troops and supplies sent to Europe during World War I , via the New York Port of Embarkation . The congestion at the port led experts to realize the need for a port authority to supervise the extremely complex system of bridges , highways , subways , and port facilities in the New York @-@ New Jersey area . The solution was the 1921 creation of the Port Authority under the supervision of the governors of the two states . By issuing its own bonds , it was financially independent of either state ; the bonds were paid off from tolls and fees , not from taxes . It became one of the major agencies of the metropolitan area for large @-@ scale projects . 
 = = = Previous disputes = = = 
 In the early years of the 20th century , there were disputes between the states of New Jersey and New York over rail freights and boundaries . At the time , rail lines terminated on the New Jersey side of the harbor , while ocean shipping was centered on Manhattan and Brooklyn . Freight had to be shipped across the Hudson River in barges . In 1916 , New Jersey launched a lawsuit against New York over issues of rail freight , with the Interstate Commerce Commission ( ICC ) issuing an order that the two states work together , subordinating their own interests to the public interest . The Harbor Development Commission , a joint advisory board set @-@ up in 1917 , recommended that a bi @-@ state authority be established to oversee efficient economic development of the port district . The Port of New York Authority was established on April 30 , 1921 , through an interstate compact between the states of New Jersey and New York . This was the first such agency in the United States , created under a provision in the Constitution of the United States permitting interstate compacts . The idea for the Port Authority was conceived during the Progressive Era , which aimed at the reduction of political corruption and at increasing the efficiency of government . With the Port Authority at a distance from political pressures , it was able to carry longer @-@ term infrastructure projects irrespective of the election cycles and in a more efficient manner . In 1972 it was renamed the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey to better reflect its status as a partnership between the two states . 
 Throughout its history , there have been concerns about democratic accountability , or lack thereof at the Port Authority . The Port District is irregularly shaped but comprises a 1 @,@ 500 @-@ square @-@ mile ( 3 @,@ 900 km2 ) area roughly within a 25 @-@ mile ( 40 km ) radius of the Statue of Liberty . 
 = = = Interstate crossings = = = 
 At the beginning of the 20th century , there were no road bridge or tunnel crossings between the two states . The initial tunnel crossings were completed privately by the Hudson and Manhattan Railroad in 1908 and 1909 ( " Hudson Tubes " ) , followed by the Pennsylvania Railroad in 1910 ( " North River Tunnels " ) . Under an independent agency , the Holland Tunnel was opened in 1927 , with some planning and construction pre @-@ dating the Port Authority . With the rise in automobile traffic , there was demand for more Hudson River crossings . Using its ability to issue bonds and collect revenue , the Port Authority has built and managed major infrastructure projects . Early projects included bridges across the Arthur Kill , which separates Staten Island from New Jersey . The Goethals Bridge , named after chief engineer of the Panama Canal Commission General George Washington Goethals , connected Elizabeth , New Jersey and Howland Hook , Staten Island . At the south end of Arthur Kill , the Outerbridge Crossing was built and named after the Port Authority 's first chairman , Eugenius Harvey Outerbridge . Construction of both bridges was completed in 1928 . The Bayonne Bridge , opened in 1931 , was built across the Kill van Kull , connecting Staten Island with Bayonne , New Jersey . 
 Construction began in 1927 on the George Washington Bridge , linking the northern part of Manhattan with Fort Lee , New Jersey , with Port Authority chief engineer , Othmar Ammann , overseeing the project . The bridge was completed in October 1931 , ahead of schedule and well under the estimated costs . This efficiency exhibited by the Port Authority impressed President Franklin D. Roosevelt , who used this as a model in creating the Tennessee Valley Authority and other such entities . 
 In 1930 , the Holland Tunnel was placed under control of the Port Authority , providing significant toll revenues . During the late 1930s and early 1940s , the Lincoln Tunnel was built , connecting New Jersey and Midtown Manhattan . 
 In 1962 , the bankrupt Hudson & Manhattan Railroad was absorbed by the Port Authority , the Hudson Tubes restyled PATH ( Port Authority Trans @-@ Hudson ) and Hudson & Manhattan Railroad ( Hudson Terminal ) razed for the future World Trade Center .

 In 1942 , Austin J. Tobin became the Executive Director of the Port Authority . In the post @-@ World War II period , the Port Authority expanded its operations to include airports , and marine terminals , with projects including Newark Liberty International Airport and Port Newark @-@ Elizabeth Marine Terminals . Meanwhile , the city @-@ owned La Guardia Field was nearing capacity in 1939 , and needed expensive upgrades and expansion . At the time , airports were operated as loss leaders , and the city was having difficulties maintaining the status quo , losing money and unable to undertake needed expansions . The city was looking to hand the airports over to a public authority , possibly to Robert Moses ' Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority . After long negotiations with the City of New York , a 50 @-@ year lease , commencing on May 31 , 1947 , went to the Port Authority of New York to rehabilitate , develop , and operate La Guardia Airport ( La Guardia Field ) , John F. Kennedy International Airport ( Idlewild Airport ) , and Floyd Bennett Field . The Port Authority transformed the airports into fee @-@ generating facilities , adding stores and restaurants . 
 = = = = World Trade Center = = = = 
 David Rockefeller , president of Chase Manhattan Bank , who envisioned a World Trade Center for lower Manhattan , realizing he needed public funding in order to construct the massive project , approached Tobin . Although many questioned the Port Authority 's entry into the real estate market , Tobin saw the project as a way to enhance the agency 's power and prestige , and agreed to the project . The Port Authority was the overseer of the World Trade Center , hiring the architect Minoru Yamasaki and engineer Leslie Robertson . 
 Yamasaki ultimately settled on the idea of twin towers . To meet the Port Authority 's requirement to build 10 million square feet ( 930 @,@ 000 m ² ) of office space , the towers would each be 110 @-@ stories tall . The size of the project raised ire from the owner of the Empire State Building , which would lose its title of tallest building in the world . Other critics objected to the idea of this much " subsidized " office space going on the open market , competing with the private sector . Others questioned the cost of the project , which in 1966 had risen to $ 575 million . Final negotiations between The City of New York and the Port Authority centered on tax issues . A final agreement was made that the Port Authority would make annual payments in lieu of taxes , for the 40 % of the World Trade Center leased to private tenants . The remaining space was to be occupied by state and federal government agencies . In 1962 , the Port Authority signed the United States Customs Service as a tenant , and in 1964 they inked a deal with the State of New York to locate government offices at the World Trade Center . 
 In August 1968 , construction on the World Trade Center 's north tower started , with construction on the south tower beginning in January 1969 . When the World Trade Center twin towers were completed , the total cost to the Port Authority had reached $ 900 million . The buildings were dedicated on April 4 , 1973 , with Tobin , who had retired the year before , absent from the ceremonies . 
 In 1986 , Port Authority sold rights to the World Trade Center name for $ 10 to an organization run by an outgoing executive , Guy F. <unk> . He in turn made millions of dollars selling the use of the name in up to 28 different states .

 The terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 , and the subsequent collapse of the World Trade Center buildings impacted the Port Authority .

An estimated 1 @,@ 400 Port Authority employees worked in the World Trade Center . Eighty @-@ four employees , including 37 Port Authority police officers , its Executive Director , Neil D.

In rescue efforts following the collapse , two Port Authority police officers , John McLoughlin and Will Jimeno , were pulled out alive after spending nearly 24 hours beneath 30 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) of rubble . Their rescue was later portrayed in the Oliver Stone film World Trade Center . 
 = = = Fort Lee lane closure scandal = = = 
 The Fort Lee lane closure scandal was a U.S. political scandal that concerns New Jersey Governor Chris Christie 's staff and his Port Authority political appointees conspiring to create a traffic jam in Fort Lee , New Jersey as political retribution , and their attempts to cover up these actions and suppress internal and public disclosures . Dedicated toll lanes for one of the Fort Lee entrances ( used by local traffic from Fort Lee and surrounding communities ) to the upper level on the George Washington Bridge , which connects to Manhattan , were reduced from three to one from September 9 – 13 , 2013 . The toll lane closures caused massive Fort Lee traffic back @-@ ups , which affected public safety due to extensive delays by police and emergency service providers and disrupted schools due to the delayed arrivals of students and teachers . Two Port Authority officials ( who were appointed by Christie and would later resign ) claimed that reallocating two of the toll lanes from the local Fort Lee entrance to the major highways was due to a traffic study evaluating " traffic safety patterns " at the bridge , but the Executive Director of the Port Authority was unaware of a traffic study . 
 As of March 2014 , the repercussions and controversy surrounding these actions continue to be under investigation by the Port Authority , federal prosecutors , and a New Jersey legislature committee . The Port Authority 's chairman , David Samson , who was appointed by Governor Christie , resigned on March 28 , 2014 amid allegations of his involvement in the scandal and other controversies . 
 = = Governance = = 
 The Port Authority is jointly controlled by the governors of New York and New Jersey , who appoint the members of the agency 's Board of Commissioners and retain the right to veto the actions of the Commissioners from his or her own state . Each governor appoints six members to the Board of Commissioners , who are subject to state senate confirmation and serve overlapping six @-@ year terms without pay . An Executive Director is appointed by the Board of Commissioners to deal with day @-@ to @-@ day operations and to execute the Port Authority 's policies . Under an informal power @-@ sharing agreement , the Governor of New Jersey chooses the chairman of the board and the deputy executive director , while the Governor of New York selects the vice @-@ chairman and Executive Director . 
 As of March 2014 , the appointed commissioners are as follows : 
 Meetings of the Board of Commissioners are public . Members of the public may address the Board at these meetings , subject to a prior registration process via email . Public records of the Port Authority may be requested via the Office of the Secretary according to an internal Freedom of Information policy which is intended to be consistent with and similar to the state Freedom of Information policies of both New York and New Jersey . 
 Members of the Board of Commissioners are typically business titans and political power brokers who maintain close relationships with their respective Governors . On February 3 , 2011 , Former New Jersey Attorney General David Samson was named new chairman of the Port Authority . 
 Financially , the Port Authority has no power to tax and does not receive tax money from any local or state governments . Instead , it operates on the revenues it makes from its rents , tolls , fees , and facilities . 
 Patrick J. Foye became Executive Director on November 1 , 2011 . Prior to joining the Port Authority , he served as Deputy Secretary for Economic Development for Governor Andrew M. Cuomo .
