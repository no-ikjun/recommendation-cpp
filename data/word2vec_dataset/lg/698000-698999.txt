 Fischer 's career @-@ long stubbornness about match and tournament conditions was again seen in the run @-@ up to his match with Spassky . Of the possible sites , Fischer 's first choice was Belgrade , Yugoslavia , while Spassky 's was Reykjavík , Iceland . For a time it appeared that the dispute would be resolved by splitting the match between the two locations , but that arrangement failed . After that issue was resolved , Fischer refused to appear in Iceland until the prize fund was increased . London financier Jim Slater donated an additional US $ 125 @,@ 000 , bringing the prize fund up to an unprecedented $ 250 @,@ 000 ( equivalent to $ 1 @,@ 414 @,@ 000 in 2015 ) , and Fischer finally agreed to play . 
 Before and during the match , Fischer paid special attention to his physical training and fitness , which was a relatively novel approach for top chess players at that time . He had developed his tennis skills to a good level , and played frequently during off @-@ days in Reykjavík . He had also arranged for exclusive use of his hotel 's swimming pool during specified hours , and swam for extended periods , usually late at night . According to Soviet grandmaster Nikolai <unk> , Fischer " was paying great attention to sport , and that he was swimming and even boxing ... " 
 The match took place in Reykjavík from July to September 1972 and was the first to receive an American broadcast in prime time . Fischer lost the first two games in strange fashion : the first when he played a risky pawn @-@ grab in a drawn endgame , the second by forfeit when he refused to play the game in a dispute over playing conditions . Fischer would likely have forfeited the entire match , but Spassky , not wanting to win by default , yielded to Fischer 's demands to move the next game to a back room , away from the cameras whose presence had upset Fischer . After that game , the match was moved back to the stage and proceeded without further serious incident . Fischer won seven of the next 19 games , losing only one and drawing eleven , to win the match 12 ½ – 8 ½ and become the 11th World Chess Champion . 
 The Cold War trappings made the match a media sensation . It was called " The Match of the Century " , and received front @-@ page media coverage in the United States and around the world . Fischer 's win was an American victory in a field that Soviet players had dominated for the previous quarter @-@ century ; players closely identified with , and subsidized by , the Soviet state . Kasparov remarked , " Fischer fits ideologically into the context of the Cold War era : a lone American genius challenges the Soviet chess machine and defeats it " . Dutch grandmaster Jan <unk> calls Fischer 's victory " the story of a lonely hero who overcomes an entire empire " . Fischer 's sister observed , " Bobby did all this in a country almost totally without a chess culture . It was as if an Eskimo had cleared a tennis court in the snow and gone on to win the world championship " . 
 Upon Fischer 's return to New York , a Bobby Fischer Day was held . He was offered numerous product endorsement offers worth " at least $ 5 million " ( all of which he declined ) . He appeared on the cover of Sports Illustrated with American Olympic swimming champion Mark Spitz . Fischer also made an appearance on a Bob Hope TV special . Membership in the U.S. Chess Federation doubled in 1972 , and peaked in 1974 ; in American chess , these years are commonly referred to as the " Fischer Boom " . Fischer won the ' Chess Oscar ' ( an award , started in 1967 , given to the best chess player , determined through votes from chess media and leading players ) for 1970 , 1971 , and 1972 . This match attracted more worldwide interest than any chess championship before or since . 
 = = = Forfeiture of title = = = 
 Fischer was scheduled to defend his title in 1975 against Anatoly Karpov , who emerged as his challenger . Fischer , who had played no competitive games since his World Championship match with Spassky , laid out a proposal for the match in September 1973 , in consultation with FIDE official Fred Cramer . He made three principal ( non @-@ negotiable ) demands : 
 The match continues until one player wins 10 games , draws not counting . 
 No limit to the total number of games played . 
 In case of a 9 – 9 score , the champion ( Fischer ) retains the title , and the prize fund is split equally . 
 A FIDE Congress was held in 1974 during the Nice Olympiad . The delegates voted in favor of Fischer 's 10 @-@ win proposal , but rejected his other two proposals , and limited the number of games in the match to 36 . In response to FIDE 's ruling , Fischer sent a cable to Euwe on June 27 , 1974 . 
 As I made clear in my telegram to the FIDE delegates , the match conditions I proposed were non @-@ negotiable . Mr. Cramer informs me that the rules of the winner being the first player to win ten games , draws not counting , unlimited number of games and if nine wins to nine match is drawn with champion regaining title and prize fund split equally were rejected by the FIDE delegates . By so doing FIDE has decided against my participation in the 1975 World Chess Championship . Therefore , I resign my FIDE World Chess Championship title . Sincerely , Bobby Fischer . 
 The delegates responded by reaffirming their prior decisions , but did not accept Fischer 's resignation and requested that he reconsider . Many observers considered Fischer 's requested 9 – 9 clause unfair because it would require the challenger to win by at least two games ( 10 – 8 ) . Botvinnik called the 9 – 9 clause " unsporting " . Korchnoi , David Bronstein , and Lev Alburt considered the 9 – 9 clause reasonable . 
 Due to the continued efforts of U.S. Chess Federation officials , a special FIDE Congress was held in March 1975 in Bergen , Netherlands in which it was accepted that the match should be of unlimited duration , but the 9 – 9 clause was once again rejected , by a narrow margin of 35 votes to 32 . FIDE set a deadline of April 1 , 1975 , for Fischer and Karpov to confirm their participation in the match . No reply was received from Fischer by April 3 . Thus , by default , Karpov officially became World Champion . In his 1991 autobiography , Karpov professed regret that the match had not taken place , and claimed that the lost opportunity to challenge Fischer held back his own chess development . Karpov met with Fischer several times after 1975 , in friendly but ultimately unsuccessful attempts to arrange a match since Karpov would never agree to play to 10 . 
 Brian Carney opined in The Wall Street Journal that Fischer 's victory over Spassky in 1972 left him nothing to prove , except that perhaps someone could someday beat him , and he was not interested in the risk of losing . And that Fischer 's refusal to recognize peers also allowed his paranoia to flower : " The world championship he won ... validated his view of himself as a chess player , but it also insulated him from the humanizing influences of the world around him . He descended into what can only be considered a kind of madness " . 
 Bronstein felt that Fischer " had the right to play the match with Karpov on his own conditions " . Korchnoi stated : 
 Was Fischer right in demanding that the world title be protected by a two point handicap – that the challenger would be considered the winner with a 10 – 8 score and that the champion would retain his title in the event of a 9 – 9 draw ? Yes , this was quite natural : the champion deserves this , not to mention the fact that further play to the first win in the event of an even score would be nothing short of a lottery – the winner in that case could not claim to have won a convincing victory . 
 Soviet grandmaster Lev Alburt felt that the decision to not concede to Fischer 's demands rested on Karpov 's " sober view of what he was capable of " . Years later , in his 1992 match against Spassky , Fischer said that Karpov " refused to play against [ him ] under [ his ] conditions " . 
 = = Sudden obscurity = = 
 After the 1972 World Chess Championship , Fischer did not play a competitive game in public for nearly 20 years . In 1977 in Cambridge , Massachusetts , he played three games against the MIT Greenblatt computer program , winning them all . 
 On May 26 , 1981 , while walking in Pasadena , Fischer was arrested by a police patrolman , allegedly because Fischer matched the description of a man who had just committed a bank robbery in the area . Fischer , who alleged that he was slightly injured during the arrest , said that he was held for two days , subjected to assault and various types of mistreatment , and released on $ 1 @,@ 000 bail . Fischer published a 14 @-@ page pamphlet detailing his alleged experiences and saying that his arrest had been " a frame up and set up " . 
 In 1981 , Fischer stayed at the home of grandmaster Peter Biyiasas , where , over a period of four months , he beat Biyiasas seventeen times in a series of speed games . In an interview with Sports Illustrated reporter William Nack , Biyiasas assessed Fischer 's play : 
 He was too good . There was no use in playing him . It wasn 't interesting . I was getting beaten , and it wasn 't clear to me why . It wasn 't like I made this mistake or that mistake . It was like I was being gradually outplayed , from the start . He wasn 't taking any time to think . The most depressing thing about it is that I wasn 't even getting out of the middle game to an endgame . I don 't ever remember an endgame . He honestly believes there is no one for him to play , no one worthy of him . I played him , and I can attest to that . 
 = = 1992 Spassky rematch = = 
 Fischer emerged after twenty years of isolation to play Spassky ( then tied for 96th – 102nd on the FIDE rating list ) in a " Revenge Match of the 20th century " in 1992 . This match took place in Sveti Stefan and Belgrade , Yugoslavia , in spite of a United Nations embargo that included sanctions on commercial activities . Fischer demanded that the organizers bill the match as " The World Chess Championship " , although Garry Kasparov was the recognized FIDE World Champion . Fischer insisted he was still the true World Champion , and that for all the games in the FIDE @-@ sanctioned World Championship matches , involving Karpov , Korchnoi , and Kasparov , the outcomes had been prearranged . The purse for the rematch was US $ 5 million , with $ 3 @.@ 35 million of the purse to go to the winner . 
 According to grandmaster Andrew Soltis : 
 [ The match games ] were of a fairly high quality , particularly when compared with Kasparov 's championship matches of 1993 , 1995 and 2000 , for example . Yet the games also reminded many fans of how out of place Fischer was in 1992 . He was still playing the openings of a previous generation . He was , moreover , the only strong player in the world who didn 't trust computers and wasn 't surrounded by seconds and supplicants . 
 Fischer won the match with 10 wins , 5 losses , and 15 draws . Kasparov stated , " Bobby is playing OK , nothing more . Maybe his strength is 2600 or 2650 . It wouldn 't be close between us " . Yasser Seirawan believed that the match proved that Fischer 's playing strength was " somewhere in the top ten in the world " . 
 Fischer and Spassky gave ten press conferences during the match . Seirawan attended the match and met with Fischer on several occasions ; the two analyzed some match games and had personal discourse . Seirawan later wrote : " After September 23 [ 1992 ] , I threw most of what I 'd ever read about Bobby out of my head . Sheer garbage . Bobby is the most misunderstood , misquoted celebrity walking the face of the earth . " He further wrote that Fischer was not camera shy , smiled and laughed easily , was " a fine wit " and " wholly enjoyable conversationalist " . 
 The U.S. Department of the Treasury warned Fischer before the start of the match that his participation was illegal , that it would violate President George H. W. Bush 's Executive Order <unk> imposing United Nations Security Council Resolution 757 sanctions against engaging in economic activities in Yugoslavia . In response , during the first scheduled press conference on September 1 , in front of the international press , Fischer spat on the U.S. order , saying " this is my reply " . His violation of the order led U.S. Federal officials to initiate a warrant for his arrest upon completion of the match , citing , in pertinent part , " Title 50 USC § § 1701 , 1702 , and 1705 and Executive Order <unk> " . 
 Prior to the rematch against Spassky , Fischer had won a training match against Svetozar Gligorić in Sveti Stefan with six wins , one loss and three draws . 
 = = Life as an émigré = = 
 After the 1992 match with Spassky , Fischer , now a fugitive , slid back into relative obscurity , taking up residence in Budapest , Hungary , and allegedly having a relationship with young Hungarian chess master Zita <unk> . 
 Fischer claimed that standard chess was stale and that he now played blitz games of chess variants , such as Chess960 . He visited with the Polgár family in Budapest and analyzed many games with Judit , Zsuzsa , and <unk> Polgár . 
 From 2000 to 2002 , Fischer lived in Baguio City in the Philippines , residing in the same compound as the Filipino grandmaster Eugenio Torre , a close friend who acted as his second during his 1992 match with Spassky . Torre introduced Fischer to a 22 @-@ year @-@ old woman named Marilyn Young . On May 21 , 2001 Marilyn Young gave birth to a daughter named Jinky Young . Her mother claimed that Jinky was Fischer 's daughter , citing as evidence Jinky 's birth and baptismal certificates , photographs , a transaction record dated December 4 , 2007 of a bank remittance by Fischer to Jinky , and Jinky 's DNA through her blood samples . On the other hand , Magnús Skúlason , a friend of Fischer 's , said that he was certain that Fischer was not the girl 's father . On August 17 , 2010 , it was reported that a DNA test revealed that Jinky Young was not the daughter of Bobby Fischer . 
 = = = Anti @-@ semitic statements = = = 
 Fischer made numerous anti @-@ Jewish statements and professed a general hatred for Jews since at least the early 1960s . Jan Hein Donner wrote that at the time of Bled 1961 , " He idolized Hitler and read everything about him that he could lay his hands on . He also championed a brand of anti @-@ semitism that could only be thought up by a mind completely cut off from reality " . Donner took Fischer to a war museum , which " left a great impression , since [ Fischer ] is not an evil person , and afterwards he was more restrained in his remarks — to me , at least . " 
 Although Fischer described his mother as Jewish in a 1962 interview , he later denied his Jewish ancestry . In 1984 , Fischer denied being a Jew in a letter to the Encyclopaedia Judaica , insisting that they remove his name and accusing them of " fraudulently misrepresenting me to be a Jew [ ... ] to promote your religion " . 
 From the 1980s on , Fischer 's comments about Jews were a major theme in his public and private remarks . He openly denied the Holocaust , and called the United States " a farce controlled by dirty , hook @-@ nosed , circumcised Jew bastards " . Between 1999 and 2006 , Fischer 's primary means of communicating with the public was radio interviews . He participated in at least 34 such broadcasts , mostly with radio stations in the Philippines , but also in Hungary , Iceland , Colombia , and Russia . In 1999 , he gave a radio call @-@ in interview to a station in Budapest , Hungary , during which he described himself as the " victim of an international Jewish conspiracy " . In another radio interview , Fischer said that it became clear to him in 1977 , after reading The Secret World Government by Count <unk> @-@ <unk> , that Jewish agencies were targeting him . Fischer 's sudden reemergence was apparently triggered when some of his belongings , which had been stored in a Pasadena , California storage unit , were sold by the landlord who claimed it was in response to nonpayment of rent . 
 Fischer 's library contained anti @-@ semitic and racist literature such as Mein Kampf , The Protocols of the Elders of Zion , and The White Man 's Bible and Nature 's Eternal Religion by Ben Klassen , founder of the World Church of the Creator . A notebook written by Fischer contains sentiments such as " 8 / 24 / 99 Death to the Jews . Just kill the <unk> ! " and " 12 / 13 / 99 It 's time to start randomly killing Jews " . Despite his views , Fischer remained on good terms with Jewish chess players .

 Shortly after midnight on September 12 , 2001 , Philippines local time ( approximately four hours after the September 11 , 2001 attacks in the U.S. ) , Fischer was interviewed live by Pablo Mercado on the Baguio City station of the Bombo Radyo network . Fischer stated that he was happy that the airliner attacks had happened , while expressing his view on U.S. and Israeli foreign policy , saying " I applaud the act . Look , nobody gets ... that the U.S. and Israel have been slaughtering the Palestinians ... for years . " He also said " The horrible behavior that the U.S. is committing all over the world ... This just shows you , that what goes around , comes around even for the United States . " Fischer also referenced the movie Seven Days in May and said he hoped for a military coup d 'état in the U.S. , " [ I hope ] the country will be taken over by the military , they 'll close down all the synagogues , arrest all the Jews , execute hundreds of thousands of Jewish ringleaders . " In response to Fischer 's statements about 9 / 11 , the U.S. Chess Federation passed a motion to cancel his right to membership in the organization . Fischer 's right to become a member was reinstated in 2007 . 
 = = = Detention in Japan = = = 
 Fischer lived for a time in Japan . On July 13 , 2004 , acting in response to a letter from U.S. officials , he was arrested by Japanese immigration authorities at Narita International Airport near Tokyo for allegedly using a revoked U.S. passport while trying to board a Japan Airlines flight to Ninoy Aquino International Airport in Manila , Philippines . Fischer resisted arrest , claiming to have sustained bruises , cuts and a broken tooth in the process . At the time , Fischer had a passport ( originally issued in 1997 and updated in 2003 to add more pages ) that , according to U.S. officials , had been revoked in November 2003 due to his outstanding arrest warrant for the Yugoslavia sanctions violation . Despite the outstanding arrest warrant in the U.S. , Fischer said that he believed the passport was still valid . The authorities held Fischer at a custody center for 16 days before transferring him to another facility . Fischer claimed that his cell was windowless and he had not seen the light of day during that period , and that the staff had ignored his complaints about constant tobacco smoke in his cell . 
 Tokyo @-@ based Canadian journalist and consultant John <unk> set up the " Committee to Free Bobby Fischer " after meeting Fischer at Narita Airport and offering to assist him . Boris Spassky wrote a letter to U.S. President George H. W. Bush , asking " For mercy , charity " , and , if that was not possible , " to put [ him ] in the same cell with Bobby Fischer " and " to give [ them ] a chess set " . It was reported that Fischer and Miyoko Watai , the President of the Japanese Chess Association ( with whom he had reportedly been living since 2000 ) wanted to become legally married . ( It was also reported that Fischer had been living in the Philippines with Marilyn Young during the same period . ) Fischer applied for German citizenship on the grounds that his father was German . Fischer stated that he wanted to renounce his U.S. citizenship , and appealed to U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell to help him do so , though to no effect . Japan 's Justice Minister rejected Fischer 's request for asylum and ordered him deported . 
 = = = Asylum in Iceland = = = 
 Seeking ways to evade deportation to the United States , Fischer wrote a letter to the government of Iceland in early January 2005 , requesting Icelandic citizenship . Sympathetic to Fischer 's plight , but reluctant to grant him the full benefits of citizenship , Icelandic authorities granted him an alien 's passport . When this proved insufficient for the Japanese authorities , Althing ( the Icelandic Parliament ) , at the behest of William Lombardy , agreed unanimously to grant Fischer full citizenship in late March for humanitarian reasons , as they felt he was being unjustly treated by the U.S. and Japanese governments , and also in recognition of his 1972 match , which had " put Iceland on the map " . 
 After arriving in Reykjavík , Fischer gave a press conference . Fischer lived a reclusive life in Iceland , avoiding entrepreneurs and others who approached him with various proposals . Fischer moved into an apartment in the same building as his close friend and spokesman , Garðar <unk> . Garðar 's wife , <unk> <unk> , was a nurse and later looked after Fischer as a terminally ill patient . Garðar 's two children , especially his son , were very close to Fischer . Fischer also developed a friendship with Magnús Skúlason , a psychiatrist and chess player who later recalled long discussions with Fischer on a wide variety of subjects . 
 On December 10 , 2006 , Fischer telephoned an Icelandic television station and pointed out a winning combination , missed by the players and commentators . In 2005 , some of Fischer 's belongings were auctioned on eBay . Fischer claimed , in 2006 , that those belongings were worth millions of U.S. dollars . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Fischer was eccentric . He made a large number of demands for the playing conditions at his 1972 World Championship match with Spassky . He became more erratic in his years after losing his World Championship title . 
 = = = Religious affiliation = = = 
 Although Fischer 's mother was Jewish , Fischer disavowed having Jewish roots . In an interview in the January 1962 issue of Harper 's , Fischer was quoted as saying , " I read a book lately by Nietzsche and he says religion is just to dull the senses of the people . I agree . " 
 Fischer joined the Worldwide Church of God in the mid @-@ 1960s . The church prescribed Saturday Sabbath , and forbade work ( and competitive chess ) on Sabbath . According to his friend and colleague Larry Evans , in 1968 Fischer felt philosophically that " the world was coming to an end " and he might as well make some money by publishing My 60 Memorable Games ; Fischer thought that the Rapture was coming soon . During the mid 1970s Fischer contributed significant money to the Worldwide Church of God . In 1972 one journalist stated that " Fischer is almost as serious about religion as he is about chess " , and the champion credited his faith with greatly improving his chess . Yet , prophecies by Herbert W. Armstrong went unfulfilled , and the church was rocked by revelations of a series of sex scandals involving Garner Ted Armstrong . Fischer eventually left the church in 1977 , " accusing it of being ' Satanic ' , and vigorously attacking its methods and leadership . " 
 = = = Death , estate dispute , and exhumation = = = 
 On January 17 , 2008 , Fischer died from renal failure at the <unk> Hospital ( National University Hospital of Iceland ) in Reykjavík . He originally had a urinary tract blockage but refused surgery or medications . Magnús Skúlason reported Fischer 's last words as " Nothing is as healing as the human touch . " 
 On January 21 , Fischer was buried in the small Christian cemetery of <unk> church , outside the town of <unk> , 60 kilometres ( 37 mi ) southeast of Reykjavík , after a Catholic funeral presided over by Fr . Jakob Rolland of the diocese of Reykjavík . In accordance with Fischer 's wishes , only Miyoko Watai , Garðar <unk> , and Garðar 's family were present . 
 Fischer 's estate was estimated at 140 million ISK ( about 1 million GBP , or $ 2 million USD ) . It quickly became the object of a legal battle involving claims from four parties , with Miyoko Watai ultimately inheriting what remained of Fischer 's estate after government claims . The four parties were Fischer 's apparent Japanese wife Miyoko Watai , his alleged Filipino daughter Jinky Young and her mother Marilyn Young , his two American nephews Alexander and Nicholas Targ and their father Russell Targ , and the U.S. government ( claiming unpaid taxes ) . 
 According to a press release issued by Samuel <unk> , an attorney representing Jinky Young , the Supreme Court of Iceland ruled , in December 2009 , that Watai 's claim of marriage to Fischer was invalidated because of her failure to present the original copy of their alleged marriage certificate . On June 16 , 2010 , the Court ruled in favor of a petition on behalf of Jinky Young to have Bobby Fischer 's remains exhumed . The exhumation was performed on July 5 , 2010 , in the presence of a doctor , a priest , and other officials . A DNA sample was taken and Fischer 's body was then reburied . On August 17 , 2010 , the Court announced that based on the DNA sample it was determined that Fischer was not the father of Jinky Young . On March 3 , 2011 , an Icelandic district court ruled that Miyoko Watai and Fischer had married on September 6 , 2004 , and that , as Fischer 's widow and heir , Watai was therefore entitled to inherit Fischer 's estate . Fischer 's nephews were ordered to pay Watai 's legal costs , amounting to ISK 6 @.@ 6 million ( approximately $ 57 @,@ 000 ) . 
 = = = Psychology = = = 
 Fischer ’ s views and behavior attracted widespread comment Reuben Fine , psychologist and chess player , who met Fischer many times , said that " Some of Bobby 's behavior is so strange , unpredictable , odd and bizarre that even his most ardent apologists have had a hard time explaining what makes him tick . " and described him as " a troubled human being " with " obvious personal problems " . 
 Valery Krylov , advisor to Anatoly Karpov and a specialist in the " psycho @-@ physiological rehabilitation of sportsmen " , believed Bobby suffered from schizophrenia . Psychologist Joseph G <unk> , from second @-@ hand sources , concludes that " Bobby did not meet all the necessary criteria to reach diagnoses of schizophrenia or Asperger 's Disorder . The evidence is stronger for paranoid personality disorder . " 
 = = Contributions to chess = = 
 = = = Opening theory = = = 
 For most of his career , Fischer was predictable in his use of openings and variations of those openings . Despite this seeming disadvantage , it was very difficult for opponents to exploit this limitation , because Fischer 's knowledge of the openings and variations that he used was extensive . 
 As Black , Fischer would usually play the Najdorf Sicilian against 1.e4 , and the King 's Indian Defense against 1.d4 , only rarely venturing into the Nimzo @-@ Indian ( 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 ) , Benoni , Grünfeld or Neo @-@ Grünfeld . As White , Fischer almost exclusively played 1.e4 throughout his career . 
 Fischer was a master of playing with , and against , the Sicilian Defense . The next most common defense against Fischer 's 1.e4 was the Caro @-@ Kann Defense ( 1.e4 c6 ) , against which Fischer had a good record . Fischer 's worst record was against the French Defense ( 1.e4 e6 ) , especially the Winawer Variation ( 1.e4 e6 2.d4 d5 3.Nc3 Bb4 ) . Fischer maintained that the Winawer was unsound because it exposed Black 's kingside , and that , in his view , " Black was trading off his good bishop with 3 ... Bb4 and ... Bxc3 . " Later on Fischer said : " I may yet be forced to admit that the Winawer is sound . But I doubt it ! The defense is anti @-@ positional and weakens the K @-@ side . " 
 Fischer was renowned for his opening preparation and made numerous contributions to chess opening theory . He was one of the foremost experts on the Ruy Lopez . A line of the Exchange Variation ( 1.e4 e5 2.Nf3 Nc6 3.Bb5 a6 <unk> <unk> 5 @.@ 0 @-@ 0 ) is sometimes called the " Fischer Variation " after he successfully resurrected it at the 1966 Havana Olympiad . Fischer 's lifetime score with the move 5 @.@ 0 @-@ 0 in tournament and match games was eight wins , three draws , and no losses : ( 86 @.@ 36 % ) . 
 Fischer was a recognized expert in the black side of the Najdorf Sicilian and the King 's Indian Defense . He used the Grünfeld Defense and Neo @-@ Grünfeld Defense to win his celebrated games against Donald and Robert Byrne , and played a theoretical novelty in the Grünfeld against reigning World Champion Mikhail Botvinnik , refuting Botvinnik 's prepared analysis over @-@ the @-@ board . In the Nimzo @-@ Indian Defense , the line beginning with 1.d4 Nf6 2.c4 e6 3.Nc3 Bb4 4.e3 b6 <unk> Ba6 was named after him . 
 Fischer established the viability of the so @-@ called Poisoned Pawn Variation of the Najdorf Sicilian ( 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6 6.Bg5 e6 7.f4 Qb6 ) . This bold queen sortie , to snatch a pawn at the expense of development , had been considered dubious , but Fischer succeeded in proving its soundness . Out of ten tournament and match games as Black in the Poisoned Pawn , Fischer scored 70 % , winning five , drawing four , and losing only one : the 11th game of his 1972 match against Spassky . Following Fischer 's use , the Poisoned Pawn Variation became a respected line , utilized by many of the world 's leading players . 
 On the white side of the Sicilian , Fischer made advances to the theory of the line beginning 1.e4 c5 2.Nf3 d6 3.d4 cxd4 4.Nxd4 Nf6 5.Nc3 a6 ( or e6 ) <unk> , which has sometimes been named after him . In 1961 , prompted by a loss the year before to Spassky , Fischer wrote an article entitled " A Bust to the King 's Gambit " for the first issue of the American Chess Quarterly , in which he stated , " In my opinion , the King 's Gambit is busted . It loses by force . " Fischer recommended 1.e4 e5 <unk> <unk> 3.Nf3 d6 , which has since become known as the Fischer Defense , as a refutation to the King 's Gambit . Fischer later played the King 's Gambit as White in three tournament games , winning them all . 
 = = = Endgame = = = 
 Fischer had excellent endgame technique . International Master Jeremy Silman listed him as one of the five best endgame players ( along with Emanuel Lasker , Akiba Rubinstein , José Capablanca , and Vasily Smyslov ) , calling Fischer a " master of bishop endings " . The endgame of a rook , bishop , and pawns against a rook , knight , and pawns has sometimes been called the " Fischer Endgame " because of several instructive wins by Fischer ( with the bishop ) , including three against Mark Taimanov in 1970 and 1971 . 
 = = = Fischer clock = = = 
 In 1988 , Fischer filed for U.S. Patent 4 @,@ 884 @,@ 255 for a new type of chess clock , which gave each player a fixed period at the start of the game and then added a small increment after each completed move . Used in the 1992 rematch between Fischer and Spassky , the " Fischer clock " soon became standard in most major chess tournaments . 
 = = = Fischerandom Chess = = = 
 Fischer heavily disparaged chess as it was currently being played ( at the highest levels ) . As a result , on June 19 , 1996 , in Buenos Aires , Argentina , Fischer announced and advocated a variant of chess called Fischerandom Chess ( later known as Chess960 ) . The goal of Fischerandom Chess was to ensure that a game between two players is a contest between their understandings of chess , rather than their abilities to memorize opening lines or prepare opening strategies . 
 In a 2006 Icelandic Radio interview , Fischer explained his reasons for advocating Fischerandom Chess : 
 In chess so much depends on opening theory , so the champions before the last century did not know as much as I do and other players do about opening theory . So if you just brought them back from the dead they wouldn ’ t do well . They ’ d get bad openings . You cannot compare the playing strength , you can only talk about natural ability . <unk> is enormously powerful . Some kid of fourteen today , or even younger , could get an opening advantage against Capablanca , and especially against the players of the previous century , like Morphy and Steinitz . Maybe they would still be able to <unk> the young kid of today . Or maybe not , because nowadays when you get the opening advantage not only do you get the opening advantage , you know how to play , they have so many examples of what to do from this position ... and that is why I don ’ t like chess any more ... It is all just memorization and prearrangement ... 
 = = = Legacy = = = 
 Kasparov calls Fischer " perhaps the most mythologically shrouded figure in chess " . Some leading players and some of Fischer 's biographers have ranked him as the greatest player who ever lived . Other writers have said that he was arguably the greatest player ever , without reaching a definitive conclusion .

 Fischer 's great rival Mikhail Tal praised him as " the greatest genius to have descended from the chess heavens " . American grandmaster Arthur Bisguier wrote " Robert James Fischer is one of the few people in any sphere of endeavour who has been accorded the accolade of being called a legend in his own time . " Former World Champion Tigran Petrosian stated that Fischer put more time into chess than the entire Soviet team . 
 Biographers David Edmonds and John <unk> wrote : 
 Faced with Fischer 's extraordinary coolness , his opponents [ sic ] assurance would begin to disintegrate . A Fischer move , which at first glances looked weak , would be reassessed . It must have a deep master plan behind it , undetectable by mere mortals ( more often than not they were right , it did ) . The U.S. grandmaster Robert Byrne labeled the phenomenon " Fischer @-@ fear " . Grandmasters would wilt , their suits would crumple , sweat would glisten on their brows , panic would overwhelm their nervous systems . Errors would creep in . Calculations would go awry . There was talk among grandmasters that Fischer hypnotized his opponents , that he undermined their intellectual powers with a dark , mystic , insidious force . 
 Kasparov wrote that Fischer " became the detonator of an avalanche of new chess ideas , a revolutionary whose revolution is still in progress " . In January 2009 , reigning World Champion Viswanathan Anand described him as " the greatest chess player who ever lived " . Serbian grandmaster Ljubomir Ljubojević called Fischer , " A man without frontiers . He didn 't divide the East and the West , he brought them together in their admiration of him . " 
 German grandmaster Karsten Müller wrote : 
 Fischer , who had taken the highest crown almost singlehandedly from the mighty , almost invincible Soviet chess empire , shook the whole world , not only the chess world , to its core . He started a chess boom not only in the United States and in the Western hemisphere , but worldwide . Teaching chess or playing chess as a career had truly become a respectable profession .

 The 139th Boat Race took place on 27 March 1993 . Held annually , the Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing race between crews from the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge along the River Thames . Cambridge , using " cleaver blades " for the first time in the history of the race , won by three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half lengths in a victory that was described in The Times as " crushingly conclusive " . The winning time of 17 minutes exactly was the fourth @-@ fastest time in the event . In winning the event , Cambridge prevented Oxford making it seventeen wins from the last eighteen races and levelling the overall score for the first time since the 1929 race . 
 Oxford 's crew featured two Olympic gold medallists and saw changes in their rowers and cox in the lead @-@ up to the event . The race was umpired by the former Oxford Blue Mark Evans who controversially instigated changes to the start procedure of the race . 
 In the reserve race , Cambridge 's Goldie defeated Oxford 's Isis , while Cambridge won the Women 's Boat Race . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Boat Race is a side @-@ by @-@ side rowing competition between the University of Oxford ( sometimes referred to as the " Dark Blues " ) and the University of Cambridge ( sometimes referred to as the " Light Blues " ) . First held in 1829 , the race takes place on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities ; it is followed throughout the United Kingdom and broadcast worldwide . Oxford went into the race as reigning champions , having won the 1992 race by one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ quarter lengths , with Cambridge leading overall with 69 victories to Oxford 's 68 ( excluding the " dead heat " of 1877 ) . Oxford had won 16 of the previous 17 races , a run interrupted by Cambridge 's seven @-@ length victory in the 1986 race . 
 The first Women 's Boat Race took place in 1927 , but the event did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s . Until 2014 , the contest was conducted as part of the Henley Boat Races , but as of the 2015 race , it is held on the River Thames , on the same day as the men 's main and reserve races . The reserve race , contested between Oxford 's Isis boat and Cambridge 's Goldie boat has been held since 1965 . It usually takes place on the Tideway , prior to the main Boat Race . 
 Cambridge selected cleaver blades for the first time in the history of the race , following the successful use of the oars in the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona . The surface area of the cleaver was approximately 20 % larger than the conventional <unk> blades . Oxford practised with cleaver blades in some of their outings leading up to the race , and were prepared to use them should the weather conditions be suitable , but on the day itself they opted to remain with the <unk> blades . 
 The umpire for the race was the Canadian Olympic gold medallist and former Oxford Blue Mark Evans who had rowed in the 1983 and 1984 races . He caused controversy by instigating a new starting method whereby he would hold the crews for up to ten seconds between the conventional " set " and " go " commands . Evans had umpired the 1991 race in which he had also used his own starting method in preference to the traditional Amateur Rowing Association instructions . In response to any potential delay at the start during which time the boats will be dragged along with the tide , one of the stake @-@ boat men , Bob Hastings , responsible for holding the boats until the " go " command is given stated : " If the boats start to drag I will let go , before I am dragged out of the stake @-@ boat " . Both Alan Inns , former coach and advisor to Cambridge , and Steve Royle , Oxford 's director of rowing , expressed concerns over Evans ' methodology . 
 = = Crews = = 
 The Oxford crew weighed an average of nearly 2 pounds ( 0 @.@ 91 kg ) more per rower than their opponents . Oxford 's Matthew Pinsent was the heaviest rower while Cambridge 's Sinclair Gore was the youngest , aged 19 . Cambridge 's crew featured three returning Blues in Dirk Bangert , David Gillard and James Behrens , while Oxford saw five former Boat Race rowers return . Overall , half of the rowers were non @-@ British ( six nationalities representing Oxford , three representing Cambridge ) and the same number were postgraduates . The Cambridge boat club president Behrens claimed : " All our boat are at Cambridge on academic merit . They came for a particular course ... and they also row . " In contrast , an editorial in The Times claimed : " The performers are no longer ingenuous native undergraduates but supercharged , international , professional rowing machines . " Oxford 's Bruce Robertson ( men 's eight ) and Pinsent ( coxless pair ) were both gold medallists at the Barcelona Olympics . 
 A late change in the Oxford cox saw Samantha Benham replace Gordon Buxton to steer the Dark Blues , becoming the eighth female cox in the history of the race . Oxford 's Royle noted that Buxton 's form had declined in the run @-@ in to the race , while Benham was " handling the pressure a lot better . " Cambridge cox , Martin Haycock , suggested that female coxes were not as accomplished as their male counterparts : " We had one cox who was exceptionally good at giving massages but on the whole ... they 're not aggressive or tough enough . " Oxford also saw a change to their crew in the week preceding the race . Old Etonian undergraduate Ed Haddon ( who had rowed for Isis in 1992 ) was dropped in favour of German Philipp Schuller . Schuller had arrived at Oxford just two months earlier , but rejected suggestions that his late inclusion was symptomatic of the recent influx of " professionals " to the race . Of his selection , he noted : " You can 't have one of the most respected races in the world and then limit it to English people between the ages of 19 and 21 ... on the day we went for whoever would make the boat go fastest . It was done entirely on merit . " Schuller 's compatriot and opponent Dirk Bangert had struggled with the move to <unk> , finding it difficult to adjust his timing : " I nearly didn 't make it . I couldn 't get this rhythm until about three weeks ago and was not sure of my place . " 
 Oxford 's finishing coach was Mike Spracklen who had assisted the Dark Blues in five victorious races , while Cambridge had New Zealander Harry Mahon in charge for the first time , assisted by John Wilson ( who had helped coach Oxford to a win in the 1991 race ) , and Sean Bowden , who was subsequently credited with " being half of the team which first turned Cambridge round " . Oxford 's head coach Patrick Sweeney noted : " If [ Cambridge ] get away , they will be hard to beat . If they don 't , they 're dead meat . " 
 = = Race = = 
 Oxford were strong pre @-@ race favourites , having won 16 of the last 17 races . Cambridge won the toss and elected to start from the Surrey station . Two minutes after the start , and in cold , overcast conditions , Cambridge 's cox Martin Haycock was level with Oxford 's Jo Michels who occupied the number two seat in the Dark Blue boat . Responding to a call to push on , Cambridge were clear upon reaching the Mile Post in record time , and moved in front of Oxford . Further record times were set as the Light Blues passed under Hammersmith Bridge and by Chiswick Steps before they passed the finishing post three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half lengths clear in 17 minutes . It was Cambridge 's first victory since the 1986 race and just their second victory in eighteen years . The winning time was the fourth fastest in the history of the event , surpassed only by Oxford in the 1991 , 1984 and 1976 races , and was Cambridge 's fastest time ever . Cambridge 's victory prevented the overall score from being levelled for the first time since 1929 . 
 In the reserve race , Cambridge 's Goldie won by nine lengths over Isis , their sixth victory in seven years . Cambridge won the 48th Women 's Boat Race by four @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half lengths in a time of 6 minutes and 10 seconds , their fourth victory in five years . 
 = = Reaction = = 
 The journalist David Miller , writing for The Times , described Cambridge 's victory as " crushingly conclusive " . Cambridge 's Malcolm Baker said : " We knew we could do it after about 25 strokes . " Behrens explained " Our strength was that we were more uniform than Oxford . We have proved that you do not have to be an Olympic champion to win the Boat Race . " The Oxford Boat Club president Pinsent conceded : " They put right a lot of mistakes they have made in the past , and they rowed outstandingly well . " Spracklen agreed : " Cambridge got too far away . They were a better boat in that race . All credit to them . " Cambridge 's number two , David Gillard , said " there was a lot of revenge out there " . 
 Writing in The Independent , the journalist Chris Arnot noted that the Cambridge crew had used creatine supplements in order to attempt to enhance their performance . Used extensively at the 1992 Olympics , by athletes including Linford Christie and Sally Gunnell , and given to horses and greyhounds , creatine was believed to provide legal energy @-@ enhancing effects to the crew . 
 = Alanya = 
 Alanya ( Turkish pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ) , formerly Alaiye , is a beach resort city and a component district of Antalya Province on the southern coast of Turkey , in the country 's Mediterranean Region , 138 kilometres ( 86 mi ) east of the city of Antalya . As of Turkey 's 2010 Census , the city had a population of 98 @,@ 627 , while the district that includes the city and its built @-@ up region had an area of 1 @,@ 598 @.@ 51 km2 and 248 @,@ 286 inhabitants . 
 Because of its natural strategic position on a small peninsula into the Mediterranean Sea below the Taurus Mountains , Alanya has been a local stronghold for many Mediterranean @-@ based empires , including the Ptolemaic , Seleucid , Roman , Byzantine , and Ottoman Empires . Alanya 's greatest political importance came in the Middle Ages , with the Seljuk Sultanate of Rûm under the rule of Alaeddin Kayqubad I , from whom the city derives its name . His building campaign resulted in many of the city 's landmarks , such as the Kızıl Kule ( Red Tower ) , Tersane ( Shipyard ) , and Alanya Castle . 
 The Mediterranean climate , natural attractions , and historic heritage make Alanya a popular destination for tourism , and responsible for nine percent of Turkey 's tourism sector and thirty percent of foreign purchases of real estate in Turkey . Tourism has risen since 1958 to become the dominant industry in the city , resulting in a corresponding increase in city population . Warm @-@ weather sporting events and cultural festivals take place annually in Alanya . In 2014 Mayor Adem Murat Yücel , of the Nationalist Movement Party unseated Hasan <unk> , of the Justice and Development Party , who had previously led the city since 1999 . 
 = = Names = = 
 The city has changed hands many times over the centuries , and its name has reflected this . Alanya was known in Latin as Coracesium or in Greek as Korakesion from the Luwian <unk> meaning " point / protruding city " . The Roman Catholic Church still recognizes the Latin name as a titular see in its hierarchy . Under the Byzantine Empire it become known as <unk> or Kalon Oros , meaning " beautiful / fine mountain " in Greek . The Seljuks renamed the city Alaiye ( <unk> ) , a derivative of the Sultan Alaeddin Kayqubad I 's name . In the 13th and 14th centuries , Italian traders called the city <unk> or <unk> . In his 1935 visit , Mustafa Kemal Atatürk finalized the name in the new alphabet as Alanya , changing the ' i ' and ' e ' in Alaiye , reportedly because of a misspelled telegram in 1933 . 
 = = History = = 
 Finds in the nearby <unk> Cave indicate occupation during the Paleolithic era as far back as 20 @,@ 000 BC , and archeological evidence shows a port existed at <unk> , south of the modern city , during the Bronze Age around 3 @,@ 000 BC . A Phoenician language tablet found in the district dates to 625 BC , and the city is specifically mentioned in the 4th @-@ century BC Greek geography manuscript , the <unk> of Pseudo @-@ Scylax . The castle rock was likely inhabited under the Hittites and the Achaemenid Empire , and was first fortified in the Hellenistic period following the area 's conquest by Alexander the Great . Alexander 's successors left the area to one of the competing Macedonian generals , Ptolemy I Soter , after Alexander 's death in 323 BC . His dynasty maintained loose control over the mainly Isaurian population , and the port became a popular refuge for Mediterranean pirates . The city resisted Antiochus III the Great of the neighboring Seleucid kingdom in 199 BC , but was loyal to the pirate Diodotus Tryphon when he seized the Seleucid crown from 142 to 138 BC . His rival Antiochus VII Sidetes completed work in 137 BC on a new castle and port , begun under Diodotus . 
 The Roman Republic fought Cilician pirates in 102 BC , when Marcus Antonius the Orator established a proconsulship in nearby Side , and in 78 BC under Servilius <unk> , who moved to control the Isaurian tribes . The period of piracy in Alanya finally ended after the city 's incorporation into the Pamphylia province by Pompey in 67 BC , with the Battle of Korakesion fought in the city 's harbor . Isaurian banditry remained an issue under the Romans , and the tribes revolted in the fourth and fifth centuries AD , with the largest rebellion being from 404 to 408 . 
 With the spread of Christianity Coracesium , as it was called , became a bishopric . Its bishop <unk> took part in the First Council of Constantinople in 381 , <unk> in the Council of Ephesus in 431 , <unk> in the Council of Chalcedon in 451 , and Nicephorus ( Nicetas ) in the Third Council of Constantinople in 680 . Coracesium was a suffragan of the metropolitan see of Side , the capital of the Roman province of Pamphylia Prima , to which Coracesium belonged . It continued to be mentioned in the <unk> <unk> as late as the 12th or 13th century . No longer a residential bishopric , Coracesium is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see . 
 Islam arrived in the 7th century with Arab raids , which led to the construction of new fortifications . The area fell from Byzantine control after the Battle of Manzikert in 1071 to tribes of Seljuk Turks , only to be returned in 1120 by John II Komnenos . 
 Following the Fourth Crusade 's attack on the Byzantines , the Christian Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia periodically held the port , and it was from an Armenian , Kir Fard , that the Turks took lasting control in 1221 when the Anatolian Seljuk Sultan Alaeddin Kayqubad I captured it , assigning the former ruler , whose daughter he married , to the governance of the city of <unk> . Seljuk rule saw the golden age of the city , and it can be considered the winter capital of their empire . Building projects , including the twin citadel , city walls , arsenal , and Kızıl Kule , made it an important seaport for western Mediterranean trade , particularly with Ayyubid Egypt and the Italian city @-@ states . Alaeddin Kayqubad I also constructed numerous gardens and pavilions outside the walls , and many of his works can still be found in the city . These were likely financed by his own treasury and by the local emirs , and constructed by the contractor Abu ' Ali al @-@ <unk> al @-@ Halabi . Alaeddin Kayqubad I 's son , Sultan <unk> <unk> II , continued the building campaign with a new cistern in 1240 . 
 At the Battle of <unk> <unk> in 1242 , the Mongol hordes broke the Seljuk hegemony in Anatolia . Alanya was then subject to a series of invasions from Anatolian beyliks . Lusignans from Cyprus briefly overturned the then ruling <unk> dynasty in 1371 . The <unk> sold the city in 1427 for 5 @,@ 000 gold coins to the Mamluks of Egypt for a period before General <unk> Ahmed Pasha in 1471 incorporated it into the growing Ottoman Empire . The city was made a capital of a local sanjak in the eyalet of <unk> . The Ottomans extended their rule in 1477 when they brought the main shipping trade , lumber , then mostly done by Venetians , under the government monopoly . On September 6 , 1608 , the city rebuffed a naval attack by the Order of Saint Stephen from the Republic of Venice . 
 Trade in the region was negatively impacted by the development of an oceanic route from Europe around Africa to India , and in the tax registers of the late sixteenth century , Alanya failed to qualify as an urban center . In 1571 the Ottomans designated the city as part of the newly conquered province of Cyprus . The conquest further diminished the economic importance of Alanya 's port . Traveler Evliya Çelebi visited the city in 1671 / 1672 , and wrote on the preservation of Alanya Castle , but also on the dilapidation of Alanya 's suburbs . The city was reassigned in 1864 under Konya , and in 1868 under Antalya , as it is today . During the 18th and 19th centuries numerous villas were built in the city by Ottoman nobility , and civil construction continued under the local dynastic <unk> authorities . Bandits again became common across Antalya Province in the mid @-@ nineteenth century . 
 After World War I , Alanya was nominally partitioned in the 1917 Agreement of <unk> @-@ de @-@ Maurienne to Italy , before returning to the Turkish Republic in 1923 under the Treaty of Lausanne . Like others in this region , the city suffered heavily following the war and the population exchanges that heralded the Turkish Republic , when many of the city 's Christians resettled in Nea Ionia , outside Athens . The Ottoman census of 1893 listed the number of Greeks in the city at 964 out of a total population of 37 @,@ 914 . Tourism in the region started among Turks who came to Alanya in the 1960s for the alleged healing properties of Damlataş Cave , and later the access provided by Antalya Airport in 1998 allowed the town to grow into an international resort . Strong population growth through the 1990s was a result of immigration to the city , and has driven a rapid modernization of the infrastructure . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Located on the Gulf of Antalya on the Anatolian coastal plain of Pamphylia , the town is situated between the Taurus Mountains to the north and the Mediterranean Sea , and is part of the Turkish <unk> , occupying roughly 70 kilometres ( 43 mi ) of coastline . From west to east , the Alanya district is bordered by the Manavgat district along the coast , the mountainous <unk> inland , Hadim and <unk> in the Province of Konya , <unk> in the Province of <unk> , and the coastal <unk> district . Manavgat is home to the ancient cities of Side and Selge . East of the city , the Dim River flows from the mountains in Konya on a south @-@ west route into the Mediterranean . 
 The Pamphylia plain between the sea and the mountains is an isolated example of an Eastern Mediterranean conifer @-@ sclerophyllous @-@ broadleaf forest , which include Lebanon Cedar , evergreen scrub , fig trees , and black pine . The Alanya Massif refers to the area of metamorphic rocks east of Antalya . This formation is divided into three <unk> from lowest to highest , the <unk> , the <unk> , and the <unk> . The similar lithology extends beneath the city in a tectonic window . Bauxite , an aluminum ore , is common to the area north of city , and can be mined . 
 The town is divided east – west by a rocky peninsula , which is the distinctive feature of the city . The harbor , city center , and <unk> Beach , named after the Sultan Kayqubad I , are on the east side of the peninsula . Damlataş Beach , named for the famous " dripping caves " , and <unk> Beach are to the west . The name " Cleopatra " possibly derives from either the Ptolemaic princess ' visit here or the area 's inclusion in her dowry to Mark Antony . Atatürk <unk> , the main boulevard , runs parallel to the sea , and divides the southern , much more touristic side of Alanya from the northern , more indigenous side that extends north into the mountains . <unk> <unk> Caddesi , another major road , encircles the main town to the north . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Alanya has a typical hot @-@ summer Mediterranean climate ( Köppen : Csa ) . Located at the Mediterranean Basin , the subtropical high pressure zone ensures that most rain comes during the winter , leaving the summers long , hot , and dry , prompting the Alanya board of Tourism to use the slogan " where the sun smiles " . Storm cells sometimes bring with them fair weather waterspouts when close to the shore . The presence of the Taurus Mountain in close proximity to the sea causes fog , in turn creating visible rainbows many mornings . The height of the mountains creates an interesting effect as snow can often be seen on them even on hot days in the city below . The sea at Alanya has an average temperature of 21 @.@ 4 ° C ( 71 ° F ) annually , with an average August temperature of 28 ° C ( 82 ° F ) . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 On the peninsula stands Alanya Castle , a Seljuk era citadel dating from 1226 . Most major landmarks in the city are found inside and around the castle . The current castle was built over existing fortifications and served the double purpose of a palace of local government and as a defensive structure in case of attack . In 2007 , the city began renovating various sections of the castle area , including adapting a Byzantine church for use as a Christian community center . Inside the castle is the Süleymaniye mosque and caravanserai , built by Suleiman the Magnificent . The old city walls surround much of the eastern peninsula , and can be walked . Inside the walls are numerous historic villas , well preserved examples of the classical period of Ottoman architecture , most built in the early 19th century . 
 The Kızıl Kule ( Red Tower ) is another well @-@ known building in Alanya . The 108 @-@ foot ( 33 m ) high brick building stands at the harbor below the castle , and contains the municipal ethnographic museum . Sultan Kayqubad I brought the accomplished architect <unk> Ali from Aleppo , Syria to Alanya to design the building . The last of Alanya Castle 's 83 towers , the octagonal structure specifically protected the Tersane ( dockyard ) , it remains one of the finest examples of medieval military architecture . The Tersane , a medieval drydock built by the Seljuk Turks in 1221 , 187 by 131 feet ( 57 by 40 m ) , is divided into five vaulted bays with equilateral pointed arches . The Alara Castle and caravanserai near Manavgat , also built under Kayqubad 's authority , has been converted into a museum and heritage center . 
 Atatürk 's House and Museum , from his short stay in the city on February 18 , 1935 is preserved in its historic state and is a good example of the interior of a traditional Ottoman villa , with artifacts from the 1930s . The house was built between 1880 and 1885 in the " <unk> " ( stuffed eggplant ) style . Bright colors and red roofs are often mandated by neighborhood councils , and give the modern town a pastel glow . Housed in a 1967 Republican era building , The Alanya Museum is inland from <unk> Beach . With its rich architectural heritage , Alanya is a member of the Norwich @-@ based European Association of Historic Towns and Regions . In 2009 , city officials filed to include Alanya Castle and Tersane as UNESCO World Heritage Sites , and were named to the 2009 Tentative List . 
 = = Demographics = = 
 From only 87 @,@ 080 in 1985 , the district has surged to hold a population of 384 @,@ 949 in 2007 . This population surge is largely credited to immigration to the city as a result or byproduct of the increased prominence of the real estate sector and the growth of the housing market bubble . The city itself has a population of 134 @,@ 396 , of which 9 @,@ 789 are European expatriates , about half of them from Germany and Denmark . 17 @,@ 850 total foreigners own property in Alanya . The European expatriate population tends to be over fifty years old . During the summer the population increases due to large numbers of tourists , about 1 @.@ 1 million each year pass through the city . Both Turks and Europeans , these vacationers provide income for much of the population . 
 The city is home to many migrants from the Southeastern Anatolia Region and the Black Sea region . In the first decade of the 21st century , the town has seen a surge in illegal foreign immigrants from the Middle East and South Asia , both to stay and to attempt to enter European Union countries . As of 2006 , 1 @,@ 217 migrants claim residence in Alanya while working abroad . <unk> nomads also live in the Taurus Mountains north of the city on a seasonal basis . Additionally , there is a small African community descendant from imported Ottoman slaves . 
 The city is nearly 99 % Muslim , and although many ancient churches can be found in the district , there are no weekly Christian services . In 2006 , a German language Protestant church with seasonal service opened with much fanfare , after receiving permission to do so in 2003 , a sign of the growing European population in the city . In 2015 , the town began renovations of the Greek Orthodox Agios Georgios Church in the village of <unk> <unk> , and the church has been used for a monthly Russian Orthodox service . Alanya also provides the Atatürk Cultural Center to Christian groups on a regular basis for larger religious ceremonies . 
 = = Education and health = = 
 The city has 95 % literacy , with public and private schools , and a roughly 1 : 24 student @-@ teacher ratio . Rural villages are , however , disadvantaged by the limited number of secondary schools outside the city center . Alantur Primary School , which opened in 1987 , was built and is maintained under the Turkish " Build Your Own School " initiative , supported by the foundation of <unk> <unk> , the founder of <unk> Holding . 
 In 2005 , Akdeniz University of Antalya launched the Alanya Faculty of Business , as a satellite campus that focuses on the tourism industry . The school hosts an International Tourism Conference annually in coordination with Buckinghamshire New University . The city also has plans to open a private university in 2012 . Georgetown University operates an annual study abroad program for American students known as the McGhee Center for Eastern Mediterranean Studies , named for the United States Ambassador to Turkey from 1952 – 53 George C. McGhee , and based in his villa . <unk> University Medical and Research Center of Alanya , a teaching hospital run by <unk> University in Ankara is one of nineteen hospitals in Alanya . Other major hospitals include the 300 @-@ bed Alanya State Hospital and the 90 @-@ bed Private Hayat Hospital . 
 = = Culture = = 
 Alanya 's culture is a subculture of the larger Culture of Turkey . The city 's seaside position is central to many annual festivals . These include the Tourism and Arts Festival , which marks the opening of the tourism season from at the end of May or beginning of June . At the opposite end of the season , the Alanya International Culture and Art Festival is held in the last week of May , and is a notable Turkish festival . Other regular festivals include the Alanya Jazz Days , which has been held since 2002 in September or October at the Kızıl Kule , which is otherwise home to the municipal ethnographic museum . The Jazz Festival hosts Turkish and international jazz musicians in a series of five free concerts . 
 The Alanya Chamber Orchestra , formed of members of the Antalya State Opera and Ballet , gave its inaugural performance on December 7 , 2007 . The International Alanya Stone Sculpture Symposium , begun is 2004 , is held over the month of November . The Alanya Documentary Festival was launched in 2001 by the Alanya Cinémathèque Society and the Association of Documentary Filmmakers in Turkey . <unk> <unk> , Turkish poet and writer , and founder of the Istanbul International Film Festival was born in Alanya , as was actress Sema <unk> . 
 Atatürk 's visit to Alanya is also celebrated on its anniversary each February 18 , centered on Atatürk 's House and Museum . The Alanya Museum is home to archaeology found in and around the city , including a large bronze Hercules statue , ceramics , and Roman limestone ossuaries , as well as historic copies of the Qur 'an . European residents of Alanya also often celebrate their national holidays , such as Norwegian Constitution Day , and the city set up a Christmas market in December 2010 . Iranians also celebrate the Persian New Year , <unk> , in Alanya . 
 = = Government = = 
 Alanya was set up as a municipality in 1872 , electing its first mayor in 1901 . Today , Alanya is governed by a mayor and a municipality council made up of thirty @-@ seven members . Eighteen councilors are from the far @-@ right Nationalist Movement Party , seven are from the center @-@ left Republican People 's Party , and twelve are of the Justice and Development Party ( AK Party ) , which is currently in power in the national government . Mayor Adem Murat Yücel of the Nationalist Movement Party was elected in 2014 by unseating the incumbent Hasan <unk> , who had previously been mayor since 1999 . Elections are held every five years , with the next to be held in March 2019 . Alanya also has a deputy mayor , who often represents the city at its sporting events , and together the mayor and his team represent Alanya in the provincial assembly in Antalya . 
 Alanya District is divided up into 17 municipalities , including the city center , and 92 villages . Alanya is greatly influenced by the provincial government in Antalya , and the national government in Ankara , which appoints a governor for the district , currently Dr. <unk> <unk> . Although Alanya has been part of Antalya Province since the Ottoman Empire , many local politicians have advocated a separate Alanya Province , a position supported by associations of foreign residents . 
 Nationally , in the 2007 election , the province voted with the Justice and Development Party , who were followed closely by the Republican People 's Party and the True Path Party . <unk> <unk> , of the Justice and Development Party , is the only native <unk> Member of Parliament representing Antalya Province in the Grand National Assembly , where he chairs the Committee on Migration , Refugees and Population . <unk> is the current Turkish Foreign Minister and also served as the president of the Parliamentary Assembly of the Council of Europe . 
 = = Economy = = 
 The tourist industry in Alanya is worth just under 1 @.@ 1 billion euros per year , and is therefore the principal industry . The area is further known for its many fruit farms , particularly lemons and oranges , and large harvests of tomatoes , bananas and cucumbers . About 80 @,@ 000 tonnes of citrus fruits were produced in 2006 across 16 @,@ 840 hectares ( 41 @,@ 600 acres ) . The <unk> plum and the avocado are increasingly popular early season fruits where citrus fruits are becoming unprofitable . 
 Despite the seaside location , few residents make their living on the sea , and fishing is not a major industry . In the early 1970s , when fish stocks ran low , a system of rotating access was developed to preserve this sector . This innovative system was part of Elinor Ostrom 's research on economic governance which led to her 2009 Nobel Prize in Economics . In 2007 , locals protested the establishment of some larger chain supermarkets and clothing stores , which have opened branches in Alanya . 
 Beginning in 2003 , with the provisional elimination of restrictions on land purchases by non @-@ nationals , the housing industry in the city has become highly profitable with many new private homes and condominiums being built for European and Asian part @-@ time residents . Sixty @-@ nine percent of homes purchased by foreign nationals in the Antalya Province and 29 @.@ 9 % in all of Turkey are in Alanya . Buyers are primarily individuals , rather than investors . This housing boom put pressure on the city 's many <unk> houses and establishments as property values rise and property sales to locals fall . A height restriction in the city limits most buildings to 21 feet ( 6 @.@ 5 m ) . This keeps high rise hotels to the east and west of the city , preserving the central skyline at the expense of greater tourist potential . The fringes of the city however have seen uncontrolled expansion . 
 = = = Tourism = = = 
 Since the first modern motel was built in 1958 , considered the first year of the tourist industry in Alanya , hotels have raced to accommodate the influx of tourists , and the city as of 2007 claims 157 @,@ 000 hotel beds . Damlataş Cave , which originally sparked the arrival of outsiders because of the cave 's microclimate , with an average temperature of 72 ° F ( 22 ° C ) and 95 % humidity , is accessible on the west side of the peninsula with trails from Damlataş Beach . Many tourists , especially Scandinavians , Germans , Russians , and Dutch , regularly vacation in Alanya during the warmer months . They are drawn to the area because of property prices , warm weather , sandy beaches , access to Antalya 's historic sites , and fine cuisine . 
 Other outdoor tourist activities include wind surfing , parasailing , and banana boating . Attractions include Europe 's largest waterpark , <unk> , and Turkey 's largest go @-@ kart track . Hunting season also attracts some tourist for wild goat , pig and partridge hunting in area nature reserves . 
 For various reasons , tourist seasons after 2005 have been disappointing for Alanya 's tourism industry . Among the reasons blamed were increased PKK violence , the H5N1 bird flu found in Van , and the Mohammad cartoon controversy . Alanya officials have responded with a variety of publicity initiatives , including baking the world 's longest cake on April 26 , 2006 , a Guinness World Record . The economy has also suffered due to investment in more than 20 @,@ 000 surplus properties . Israeli tourists , commonly arriving via cruise ship , have also declined sharply by about 85 % from 2009 to 2011 due in part to strained relations between Turkey and Israel . 
 = = Media = = 
 Alanya has 10 local daily newspapers . One of these is Yeni Alanya , which includes the news and lifestyles magazine Orange and is available in English , German and Turkish . Two native German language newspapers are published in Alanya , the <unk> <unk> Rundschau and Alanya Bote for the community of German speaking residents and visitors .

 = = Transportation = = 
 The D 400 Highway , the Alanya – Mersin Route , connects Alanya from the east and west , encircling it , and linking through the city center via Atatürk <unk> . The <unk> , the Ankara – <unk> Route , runs north – south and reaches the sea 41 kilometres ( 25 mi ) west of the city near Side , connecting with the <unk> . Antalya Airport is 121 kilometres ( 75 mi ) away and connects internationally . The new Antalya <unk> Airport , first begun in 1992 , is only 14 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 0 mi ) from the city , and was expected to have its first regular domestic flights on May 22 , 2010 , although international flights were not expected before the start of the 2011 tourist season . No train routes go to Alanya or Antalya Province , and there are no train stations in the district . 
 There are bus and <unk> systems out of Alanya 's two bus depots , but buses are usually limited to the major roads , and inside the city transportation is by car , taxi , or foot , as many roads in the old town are closed to vehicle traffic . The harbor includes cruise ship piers , and also seasonal ferries and <unk> depart for Kyrenia in the Turkish Republic of Northern Cyprus . Cruise ships docking at Alanya have increased 50 % in 2013 , with 53 estimated to have brought 56 @,@ 000 passengers the end of the year . Further west of the city is the Alanya Marina , which started services in 2008 while still under construction , completing its expansion in 2010 . The 85 @-@ km2 ( 33 @-@ sq @-@ mi ) marina allowed Alanya to participate in the 2008 Eastern Mediterranean Yacht Rally . The city is also investing in a community bicycle program with 150 bicycles and twenty terminals . 
 = = Sports = = 
 Alanya is home to a woman 's basketball team , Alanya <unk> , which started in the first division but was relegated after the 2002 season . The city hosts a Süper Lig soccer team , <unk> . The club was founded in 1948 , and play home games at Milli <unk> Stadium . It played in the Second League between 1988 @-@ 1997 and 2014 @-@ 2016 . The club finally promoted to top level in 2015 @-@ 16 season . In 2007 , the city began constructing a new soccer facility with the intention of hosting winter competitions between major teams . The public Alanya Municipality Sports Facility is located adjacent to Milli <unk> Stadium , which is one of thirteen facilities . 
 Alanya 's waterfront location makes it suitable for certain events , and is perhaps most famous for its annual triathlon , part of the International Triathlon Union series , which has been held every October since 1990 . Marathon swimming competitions have also been connected to the triathlon since 1992 . Building on the triathlon 's success , Alanya hosted a modern pentathlon in 2009 . Alanya is also the regular host of The Turkish Open , part of the <unk> European Beach Volleyball championship tour , which takes place in May . In 2007 , the Turkish Volleyball Federation persuaded the European Volleyball Confederation to build a beach volleyball training facility in Alanya , and make it the exclusive " center of beach volleyball in Europe " . 
 The city is also a frequent host to national events , such as the annual beach handball tournament . Alanya is the traditional finish site of the seven @-@ day Presidential Cycling Tour of Turkey , though organizers reversed the route in 2012 , and started the event in Alanya instead . Other cycling events include the Alanya International Mountain Bike Race . Additionally , the European Cycling Union had its 2010 European road cycling championship and 2010 ordinary congress meeting in Alanya . 
 = = Sister cities = = 
 Since making agreements with Talsi , Trakai , and <unk> in 2006 , Borås in 2007 , and Rovaniemi , <unk> <unk> , and Moscow in 2009 , Alanya increased its number of sister cities to twelve , ten of which are located within the European Union . In 2005 Alanya applied with Sister Cities International for an additional sister city from the United States . The most significant tie is with the city of Nea Ionia , where many of Alanya 's Christians were resettled in 1923 after the Treaty of Lausanne . Soccer teams from sister cities Wodzisław Śląski and Schwechat have also come to train and scrimmage in Alanya . Wodzisław , Schwechat , <unk> , Fushun , and Alanya form a " family " in that most are partnered with the others . During the annual Tourism and Culture Festival , Alanya dedicates the year to focus on one country , and has involved sister cities , such as Trakai when 2009 was declared the " Year of Lithuania , " and Talsi , which was the focus of the 12th annual Tourism Parade in 2012 . 
 = Hu Die = 
 Hu Die ( Chinese : <unk> ; Wade – Giles : Hu Tieh ; 1907 or 1908 – April 23 , 1989 ) , also known by her English name Butterfly Wu , was one of the most popular Chinese actresses during the 1920s and 1930s . She starred in The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple , which started a craze for martial arts films , Sing @-@ Song Girl Red Peony , China 's first sound film , and what is considered her best film , Twin Sisters . She was voted China 's first " Movie Queen " in 1933 , and won the Best Actress Award at the 1960 Asian Film Festival for her performance in Rear Door . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Hu Die was born Hu <unk> ( Chinese : <unk> ; Wade – Giles : Hu <unk> @-@ <unk> ) in Shanghai in 1907 or 1908 , and moved to Guangzhou ( Canton ) when she was nine . Her father then became the general inspector of the Beijing – Fengtian Railway , and she spent much of her adolescence in northern cities including Beijing , Tianjin and <unk> , and learned to speak perfect Mandarin , which later proved to be a great advantage when the Chinese cinema transitioned from silent films to talkies . 
 In 1924 , Hu <unk> moved back to Shanghai with her family . When China ( Zhonghua ) Film School , the country 's first film actor training school , opened , she was the first student to enroll . She adopted the professional name " Hu Die " , meaning " butterfly " , and Butterfly Wu in English ( Wu is the Shanghainese pronunciation of Hu ) . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Hu Die played her first role in the film Success , as a supporting actress . She played her first major role in the film Autumn Stirs <unk> ( Qiu Shan Yuan ) , and fell in love with her co @-@ star Lin <unk> . The relationship did not work out , and the local newspapers were filled with rumours when they broke off their engagement . 
 In 1926 , Hu Die had her big break when she was signed by Tianyi ( Unique ) Film Company , one of the major studios of Shanghai , headed by <unk> Shaw ( Shao <unk> ) . Tianyi catered to the tastes of the common people with rapid production of films . Hu Die starred in 15 films within the two years she worked for Tianyi . Many of them , such as The Traumatic Romance of Liang and Zhu ( 1926 ) and Lady Meng Jiang ( 1927 ) , were popular , but not considered artistically worthy . 
 = = Mingxing Studio = = 
 In 1928 , Hu Die declined to renew her contract with Tianyi , and signed with the rival Mingxing ( Star ) Film Company , led by the shrewd businessman and director Zhang <unk> , and the talented writer Zheng <unk> . She had a salary of $ 1 @,@ 000 a month , a large sum at the time . Her first film with Mingxing was Tower in the White Clouds ( 1928 ) . She befriended her co @-@ star Ruan Lingyu ; the two women would become China 's biggest film stars of the 1930s . Her role as Red Girl in the film The Burning of the Red Lotus Temple ( 1928 ) propelled her to stardom . The film was such a success that the studio made 17 sequels of the same name between 1928 and 1931 . It started a craze for martial arts films , but also attracted criticism from intellectuals when children neglected their schoolwork to study martial arts or devote themselves to martial arts fiction . 
 In 1931 , Hu Die starred in Sing @-@ Song Girl Red Peony ( dir . Zhang <unk> ) , the first Chinese sound film ( although it was sound @-@ on @-@ disc , not sound @-@ on @-@ film ) . Compared with other silent @-@ era film stars , who were mostly southerners with poor Mandarin , Hu Die made the transition to sound with ease . She appeared in more sound films and was able to sing in The Flower of Freedom , a real sound film of much higher quality . 
 Hu Die starred in Twin Sisters ( <unk> Hua , dir . Zheng <unk> ) in 1934 , in which she skilfully played the double role of twin sisters with very different personalities . The film was not only extremely popular but also won critical acclaim . It is generally considered her best film .

 On 18 September 1931 , Hu Die arrived in Tianjin en route to Beijing , where Mingxing was planning to shoot the film Marriage of Tears and Laughter , an adaptation of the novel by Zhang <unk> . On the same day , the Japanese engineered the Mukden Incident , and used it as pretext to launch an invasion of Manchuria . Zhang Xueliang , the " young marshal " who was the head of the northeastern army , ordered his soldiers to retreat rather than fight the Japanese . There was rumour that on the evening that the Japanese took Mukden , Marshal Zhang was dancing with Hu Die in Beijing , a serious charge which threatened to damage her reputation . Hu Die had to purchase space on Shen Bao , Shanghai 's biggest newspaper , to dispel the rumour , which she believed was started by the Japanese media in order to discredit Zhang Xueliang . Her account was corroborated by other Mingxing actors and employees . Years later , memoirs of people close to Zhang Xueliang indicated that he had never met Hu Die in his life , and Zhang was ordered by Chiang Kai @-@ shek not to resist the much stronger enemy .

 In February 1935 , Hu Die was invited to join a Chinese delegation to participate in the Moscow International Film Festival in the Soviet Union . She was the only film star in the delegation , which mainly comprised influential men of the industry . She arrived too late for the festival , but received a warm welcome , and her films Twin Sisters and Orchid in a Remote Valley ( <unk> Lan ) were shown in Moscow and Leningrad . From Moscow she went on to tour Germany , France , England , Switzerland and Italy , receiving significant public attention and VIP treatment from the Europeans , to whom Chinese film stars were novelties . She took many notes and photographs , and published a travelogue after returning to China .

 In 1931 , a cousin introduced Hu Die to Pan Yousheng ( <unk> ) , a young employee of a Shanghai trading firm . Hu Die was careful about her personal life and their relationship progressed slowly until autumn 1935 , when they announced their impending marriage . Their wedding was the most important social event in Shanghai of that year . Famous film stars served as bridesmaids and groomsmen , and child stars were their flower girls and page boys . Hu Die was ready to retire from the film industry , as was customary at the time after an actress ' marriage , but with her husband 's support , she signed a contract with Mingxing to make one film per year . She only made one more film under the new contract , before the Second Sino @-@ Japanese War broke out , and the hard @-@ fought Battle of Shanghai completely destroyed Mingxing and other Shanghai studios in 1937 .

 As the Empire of Japan invaded and occupied Shanghai and much of east China , Hu Die and Pan Yousheng fled to British Hong Kong . Hu Die gave birth to a daughter and a boy during this time . Pan worked for a trading firm in Hong Kong , while she also made two films . After the outbreak of the Pacific War in December 1941 , Hong Kong also fell to the Japanese . The Japanese pressured her to make a documentary film entitled Hu Die Touring Tokyo for their war propaganda , but Hu Die refused to become a collaborator , and secretly escaped to inland Chongqing , the war @-@ time capital of the Republic of China resistance . It was a long and circuitous journey through a war zone . She entrusted her belongings to the underground , and casually walked out of her Hong Kong home one day . Resistance partisans guided her through the New Territories to Guangdong province . She stayed in Shaoguan for a year and a half before leaving for Guilin in Guangxi , and did not reach Chongqing until the end of 1943 . 
 Soon after arriving in Chongqing , Hu Die starred in the film The Road to Nation Building to aid the war effort . While she was filming on location in Guilin , the Japanese launched a major offensive in the area . The film crew lost all their equipment , and had to join the tens of thousands of refugees fleeing the war front on foot . The Road to Nation Building was Hu Die 's only unfinished film , and she later described the incident as " the most tragic moment of my life " . 
 While in Chongqing , Hu Die became connected with the powerful spy master Dai Li . She had been previously introduced to Dai Li in Shanghai by her colleague Xu Lai , who was married to a close friend of Dai Li 's . According to the memoir of Dai Li 's lieutenant Shen <unk> , Hu Die became Dai Li 's mistress during the period .

 Hu Die returned to Shanghai after the surrender of Japan in 1945 . Dai Li was killed in a plane crash in March 1946 . In the midst of the Chinese Civil War , Hu Die again moved with her husband to Hong Kong in 1946 . Pan Yousheng started a company making thermoses with the brand Butterfly , and she actively promoted her namesake product in Hong Kong and Southeast Asia . They lived a few happy years together , until Pan died soon after being diagnosed with liver cancer in 1958 . 
 After her husband 's death , Hu Die returned to the film industry in 1959 , now taking roles as older women , which took her some time to adjust to . She made several films for Shaw Brothers Studio , a successor company of Tianyi , and her performance in Li Han @-@ <unk> 's Rear Door ( <unk> ) won her the Best Actress Award at the Seventh Asian Film Festival held in Tokyo in 1960 . It also won the Best Film Award . 
 Hu Die retired in 1966 , after a career spanning more than four decades . It was said that in 1967 she married an admirer named Zhu <unk> ( or Song <unk> ) , who had given her financial support in the difficult period following Pan Yousheng 's death . She emigrated to Vancouver , Canada in 1975 to join her son . She lived a low @-@ key life and avoided attention by using the name Pan <unk> . She dictated her memoir in 1986 , which first appeared in Taiwan 's United Daily News in serials , and was published in mainland China in 1987 .

In 1966 , Hu <unk> married Li Zongren , who had briefly served as president of the Republic of China , and was 49 years her senior . After Li Zongren died in 1969 , she was persecuted during the Cultural Revolution , and later became a Buddhist nun . 
 = Maya stelae = 
 Maya stelae ( singular stela ) are monuments that were fashioned by the Maya civilization of ancient Mesoamerica . They consist of tall sculpted stone shafts and are often associated with low circular stones referred to as altars , although their actual function is uncertain . Many stelae were sculpted in low relief , although plain monuments are found throughout the Maya region . The sculpting of these monuments spread throughout the Maya area during the Classic Period ( 250 – 900 AD ) , and these pairings of sculpted stelae and circular altars are considered a hallmark of Classic Maya civilization . The earliest dated stela to have been found in situ in the Maya lowlands was recovered from the great city of Tikal in Guatemala . During the Classic Period almost every Maya kingdom in the southern lowlands raised stelae in its ceremonial centre . 
 Stelae became closely associated with the concept of divine kingship and declined at the same time as this institution . The production of stelae by the Maya had its origin around 400 BC and continued through to the end of the Classic Period , around 900 , although some monuments were reused in the Postclassic ( c . 900 – 1521 ) . The major city of Calakmul in Mexico raised the greatest number of stelae known from any Maya city , at least 166 , although they are very poorly preserved . 
 Hundreds of stelae have been recorded in the Maya region , displaying a wide stylistic variation . Many are upright slabs of limestone sculpted on one or more faces , with available surfaces sculpted with figures carved in relief and with hieroglyphic text . Stelae in a few sites display a much more three @-@ dimensional appearance where locally available stone permits , such as at Copán and Toniná . Plain stelae do not appear to have been painted nor overlaid with stucco decoration , but most Maya stelae were probably brightly painted in red , yellow , black , blue and other colours . 
 Stelae were essentially stone banners raised to glorify the king and record his deeds , although the earliest examples depict mythological scenes . Imagery developed throughout the Classic Period , with Early Classic stelae ( c . 250 – 600 ) displaying non @-@ Maya characteristics from the 4th century onwards , with the introduction of imagery linked to the central Mexican metropolis of Teotihuacan . This influence receded in the 5th century although some minor Teotihuacan references continued to be used . In the late 5th century , Maya kings began to use stelae to mark the end of calendrical cycles . In the Late Classic ( c . 600 – 900 ) , imagery linked to the Mesoamerican ballgame was introduced , once again displaying influence from central Mexico . By the Terminal Classic , the institution of divine kingship declined , and Maya kings began to be depicted with their subordinate lords . As the Classic Period came to an end , stelae ceased to be erected , with the last known examples being raised in 909 – 910 . 
 = = Function = = 
 The function of the Maya stela was central to the ideology of Maya kingship from the very beginning of the Classic Period through to the very end of the Terminal Classic ( 800 – 900 ) . The hieroglyphic inscriptions on the stelae of the Classic period site of Piedras Negras played a key part in the decipherment of the script , with stelae being grouped around seven different structures and each group appearing to chart the life of a particular individual , with key dates being celebrated , such as birth , marriage and military victories . From these stelae , epigrapher Tatiana Proskouriakoff was able to identify that they contained details of royal rulers and their associates , rather than priests and gods as had previously been theorised . 
 <unk> David Stuart first proposed that the Maya regarded their stelae as te tun , " stone trees " , although he later revised his reading to <unk> , meaning " banner stone " , from lakam meaning " banner " in several Mayan languages and tun meaning " stone " . According to Stuart this may refer to the stelae as stone versions of vertical standards that once stood in prominent places in Maya city centres , as depicted in ancient Maya graffiti . The name of the modern Lacandon Maya is likely to be a Colonial corruption of this word . 
 Maya stelae were often arranged to impress the viewer , forming lines or other arrangements within the ceremonial centre of the city . Maya cities with a history of <unk> that extended back into the Early Classic preferred to pair their stelae with a circular altar , which may have represented a cut tree trunk and have been used to perform human sacrifice , given the prevalence of sacrificial imagery on such monuments . An alternative interpretation of these " altars " is that they were in fact thrones that were used by rulers during ceremonial events . Archaeologists believe that they probably also served as ritual pedestals for incense burners , ceremonial fires and other offerings . 
 The core purpose of a stela was to glorify the king . Many Maya stelae depict only the king of the city , and describe his actions with hieroglyphic script . Even when the individual depicted is not the king himself , the text or scene usually relates the subject to the king . Openly declaring the importance and power of the king to the community , the stela portrayed his wealth , prestige and ancestry , and depicted him wielding the symbols of military and divine power . Stelae were raised to commemorate important events , especially at the end of a k 'atun 20 @-@ year cycle of the Maya calendar , or to mark a quarter or a half k 'atun . The stela did not just mark off a period of time ; it has been argued that it physically embodied that period of time . The hieroglyphic texts on the stelae describe how some of the calendrical ceremonies required the king to perform ritual dance and bloodletting . At Tikal , the twin pyramid groups were built to celebrate the k 'atun ending and reflected Maya cosmology . These groups possessed pyramids on the east and west sides that represented the birth and death of the sun . On the south side , a nine @-@ <unk> building was situated in order to represent the underworld . On the north side was a walled enclosure that represented the celestial region ; it was left open to the sky . It was in this celestial enclosure that a stela @-@ altar pair was placed , the altar being a fitting throne for the divine king . Calakmul practised a tradition that was unusual in the Maya area , that of raising twin stelae depicting both the king and his wife . 
 The iconography of stelae remained reasonably stable during the Classic Period , since the effectiveness of the propaganda message of the monument relied upon its symbolism being clearly recognisable to the viewer . However , at times a shift in the sociopolitical climate induced a change in iconography . Stelae were an ideal format for public propaganda since , unlike earlier architectural sculpture , they were personalised to a specific king , could be arranged in public spaces and were portable , allowing them to be moved and reset in a new location . An important feature of stelae was that they were able to survive different phases of architectural construction , unlike architectural sculpture itself . With the ability to portray an identifiable ruler bearing elite goods , accompanied by hieroglyphic text and carrying out actions in service of the kingdom , stelae became one of the most effective ways of delivering public propaganda in the Maya lowlands . In 7th @-@ century Copán , king Chan Imix K 'awiil raised a series of seven stelae that marked the boundary of the most fertile land in the Copán valley , an area of approximately 25 to 30 square kilometres ( 9 @.@ 7 to 11 @.@ 6 sq mi ) . As well as marking the boundary , they defined the sacred geometry of the city and referred to important seats of deities in the ceremonial centre of the Copán . 
 = = = Ritual significance = = = 
 Stelae were considered to be invested with holiness and , perhaps , even to contain a divine soul @-@ like essence that almost made them living beings . Some were apparently given individual names in hieroglyphic texts and were considered to be participants in rituals conducted at their location . Such rituals in the Classic Period appear to have included a k <unk> binding ritual , in which the stela was wrapped in bands of tied cloth . This ritual was closely tied to the k 'atun @-@ ending calendrical ceremony . A k <unk> ritual is depicted carved onto a peccary skull deposited as a funerary offering at Copán , the scene shows two nobles flanking a stela @-@ altar pair where the stela seems to have been bound with cloth . The act of wrapping or binding a sacred object was of considerable religious importance across Mesoamerica , and is well attested among the Maya right up to the present day . The precise meaning of the act is not clear , but may be to protect the bound object or to contain its sacred essence . The binding of stelae may be linked to the modern K 'iche ' Maya practice of wrapping small divinatory stones in a bundle . 
 A stela was not just considered a neutral portrait , it was considered to be ' owned ' by the subject , whether that subject was a person or a god . Stela 3 from El Zapote in Guatemala is a small monument dating from the Early Classic period , the front of the stela bears a portrait of the rain god Yaxhal Chaak , " Clear Water Chaak " . The accompanying text describes how the deity Yaxhal Chaak himself was dedicated , not just his image on the stela . This could be taken to imply that the stela was seen as the embodiment of the deity and is also true of those stelae bearing royal portraits , which were seen to be the supernatural embodiment of the ruler they represented . The stela , combined with any accompanying altar , was a perpetual enactment of royal ceremony in stone . David Stuart has stated that stelae " do not simply commemorate past events and royal ceremonies but serve to perpetuate the ritual act into eternity " , thus ascribing a magical effectiveness to stela depictions . In the same vein , stelae bearing royal portraits may have been magically loaded extensions of the royal person ( <unk> ' his self ' ) , extremely powerful confirmations of political and religious authority . Stelae bearing images of multiple people , for instance of several nobles performing a ritual or of a king with his war captives , were likely to be exceptions to this idea of the stela as sacred embodiment of the subject . 
 At times , when a new king came to power , old stelae would be respectfully buried and replaced with new ones , or they might be broken . When a Maya city was invaded by a rival , it was pillaged by the victors . One of the most striking archaeological markers of such an invasion is the destruction of the defeated city 's stelae , which were broken and cast down . At the end of the Preclassic , around 150 AD , this fate appears to have befallen the important city of El Mirador , where most of the stelae were found smashed . 
 = = Manufacture = = 
 Royal artisans were sometimes responsible for sculpting stelae ; in some cases these sculptors were actually the sons of kings . In other cases it is likely that captive artisans from defeated cities were put to work raising stelae for the victors , as evidenced by the sculptural style of one city appearing upon monuments of its conqueror soon after its defeat . This appears to have been the case in Piedras Negras where Stela 12 depicting war captives submitting to the victorious king is carved in the style of <unk> , the defeated city . Archaeologists believe that this may also have been the case with Quiriguá after its surprise defeat of its overlord Copán . 
 Stelae were usually crafted from quarried limestone , although in the Southern Maya area other types of stone were preferred . Volcanic tuff was used at Copán to craft their stelae in three dimensions . Both limestone and tuff were easily worked when first quarried and hardened with exposure to the elements . At Quiriguá a hard red sandstone was used that was unable to reproduce the three @-@ dimensionality of Copán but was of sufficient strength that the kings of the city were able to raise the tallest free @-@ standing stone monuments in the Americas . The Maya lacked beasts of burden and did not employ the wheel ; therefore the freshly quarried blocks of stone had to be transported on rollers along the Maya causeways . Evidence of this has been found on the causeways themselves , where rollers have been recovered . The blocks were sculpted to their final form while still soft and they then hardened naturally with time . Stone was usually quarried locally but was occasionally transported over great distances . Calakmul in Mexico was one of two powerful cities that shaped the political landscape of the Classic Period , the other being Tikal . It imported black slate for one stela from the Maya Mountains , more than 320 kilometres ( 200 mi ) away . Although Calakmul raised the greatest number of stelae known from any Maya city , they were sculpted from poor quality limestone and have suffered severe erosion , rendering most of them illegible . Stelae could be of substantial size ; Quiriguá Stela E measures 10 @.@ 6 metres ( 35 ft ) from the base to the top , including the 3 @-@ metre ( 9 @.@ 8 ft ) buried portion holding it in place . This particular monument has a claim to being the largest free @-@ standing stone monument in the New World and weighs about 59 tonnes ( 65 short tons ) . Stela 1 at Ixkun is one of the tallest monuments in the Petén Basin , measuring 4 @.@ 13 metres ( 13 @.@ 5 ft ) high , not including the buried portion , and is roughly 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) wide and 0 @.@ 39 metres ( 1 @.@ 3 ft ) thick . 
 Maya stelae were worked with stone chisels and probably with wooden mallets . <unk> were fashioned from flint and basalt and were used for shaping the softer rocks used to make stelae , while fine detail was completed with smaller chisels . Originally most were probably brightly painted in red , yellow , black , blue and other colours using mineral and organic pigments . At Copán and some other Maya cities , some traces of these pigments were found upon the monuments . 
 Generally all sides of a stela were sculpted with human figures and hieroglyphic text , with each side forming a part of a single composition . <unk> stelae in the form of plain slabs or columns of stone are found throughout the Maya region . These appear never to have been painted or to have been decorated with overlaid stucco sculpture . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Preclassic origins = = = 
 The Maya sculptural tradition that produced the stelae emerged fully formed and had probably been preceded by sculpted wooden monuments . However the tradition of raising stelae had its origin elsewhere in Mesoamerica , among the Olmecs of the Gulf Coast of Mexico . In the Late Preclassic it then spread into the Isthmus of Tehuantepec and southwards along the Pacific Coast to sites such as Chiapa de Corzo , Izapa and Takalik Abaj where Mesoamerican Long Count calendar dates began to be carved onto the stelae . Although at Izapa the stelae depicted mythological scenes , at Takalik Abaj they began to show rulers in Early Classic Maya posture accompanied by calendrical dates and hieroglyphic texts . It was also at Takalik Abaj and Izapa that these stelae began to be paired with circular altars . By approximately 400 BC , near the end of the Middle Preclassic Period , early Maya rulers were raising stelae that celebrated their achievements and validated their right to rule . At El <unk> in the Salamá Valley of highland Guatemala a carved schist stela ( Monument 1 ) was erected , the badly eroded hieroglyphs appear to be a very early form of Maya writing and may even be the earliest known example of Maya script . It was associated with a plain altar in a typical stela @-@ altar pairing that would become common across the Maya area . Stela 11 from Kaminaljuyu , a major Preclassic highland city , dates to the Middle Preclassic and is the earliest stela to depict a standing ruler . The sculpted Preclassic stelae from Kaminaljuyu and other cities in the region , such as Chalchuapa in El Salvador and Chocolá in the Pacific lowlands , tend to depict political succession , sacrifice and warfare . 
 These early stelae depicted rulers as warriors or wearing the masks and headdresses of Maya deities , accompanied by texts that recorded dates and achievements during their reigns , as well as recording their relationships with their ancestors . Stelae came to be displayed in large ceremonial plazas designed to display these monuments to maximum effect . The raising of stelae spread from the Pacific Coast and adjacent highlands throughout the Maya area . The development of Maya stelae coincides with the development of divine kingship among the Classic Maya . In the southern Maya area , the Late Preclassic stelae impressed upon the viewer the achievements of the king and his right to rule , thus reinforcing both his political and religious power . 
 At the Middle Preclassic city of Nakbe in the central lowlands , Maya sculptors were producing some of the earliest lowland Maya stelae , depicting richly dressed individuals . Nakbe Stela 1 has been dated to around 400 BC . It was broken into pieces , but originally represented two elaborately dressed figures facing each other , and perhaps represents the transference of power from one ruler to his successor , however it also has features that recall the myth of the Maya Hero Twins , and would be the earliest known presentation of them . Around 200 BC the enormous nearby city of El Mirador had started to erect stela @-@ like monuments , bearing inscriptions that appear to be glyphs but that are so far unreadable . A stela has also been discovered at El Tintal , another major Preclassic city in the Mirador Basin . 
 On the Pacific Coast El Baúl Stela 1 features a date in its hieroglyphic text that equates to 36 AD . It depicts a ruler bearing a sceptre or a spear with a double column of hieroglyphic text before him . At Takalik Abaj are two stelae ( Stela 2 and Stela 5 ) depicting the transfer of power from one ruler to another ; they both show two elaborately dressed figures facing each other with a column of hieroglyphic text between them . The Long Count date on Stela 2 dates it to the 1st century BC at the latest , while Stela 5 has two dates , the latest of which is 126 AD . The stela was associated with the burial of a human sacrifice and other offerings . Stela 13 at Takalik Abaj also dates to the Late Preclassic ; a massive offering of more than 600 ceramic vessels was found at its base , together with 33 obsidian prismatic blades and other artefacts . Both the stela and the offering were associated with a nearby Late Preclassic royal tomb . At Cuello in Belize , a plain stela was raised around 100 AD in an open plaza . 
 At the very end of the Preclassic Period , around 100 – 300 AD , cities in the highlands and along the Pacific Coast ceased to raise sculpted stelae bearing hieroglyphic texts . This cessation in the production of stelae was the most dramatic symptom of a general decline in the region at this time . This decline has been linked to the intrusion of peoples from the western highlands combined with the disastrous eruption of the <unk> Volcano that severely affected the entire region . 
 = = = Early Classic = = = 
 In the central Petén lowlands , the rise of individual rule at cities like Tikal required the development of new forms of public imagery . Preclassic imagery had involved largely anonymous , impersonal sculpture as an architectural element . The existing Preclassic Petén styles of architectural sculpture were combined with features of the highland and Pacific Coast tradition to produce the Early Classic Maya stela . Features formerly found on architectural sculpture , such as the giant masks adorning Preclassic pyramids , were adapted for use on stelae . For example , the so @-@ called " Jester God " was transferred to the headdress of the ruler portrayed on Tikal Stela 29 , which bears the oldest Long Count date yet found in the Maya lowlands – equating to 292 AD . At some Maya cities the first appearance of stelae corresponded with the foundation of dynastic rule . 
 The standard form of the Maya stela incorporating art , calendrical dates and hieroglyphic text onto a royal monument only began to be erected in the Maya lowlands after 250 AD . The late 4th century saw the introduction of non @-@ Maya imagery linked to the giant metropolis of Teotihuacan in the Valley of Mexico . This foreign influence is seen at Tikal , Uaxactun , Río Azul and El Zapote , all in the Petén Department of Guatemala . At Tikal this was initiated by the king Yax Nuun Ayiin I , from there it spread to his vassal cities . In the 5th century , this strongly Teotihuacan @-@ linked imagery was abandoned by Yax Nuun Ayiin I 's son Siyaj Chan K 'awiil II , who reintroduced imagery associated with the Pacific Coast and adjacent highlands . Minor references to Teotihuacan continued , for example in the form of Teotihuacan war emblems . His Stela 31 was originally erected in 445 but was later broken from its butt and was found buried in the city centre , almost directly above his tomb . It depicts the crowning of Siyaj Chan K 'awiil II , with his father hovering above him as a supernatural being and is executed in traditional Maya style . On the sides of the stela are carved two portraits of his father in a non @-@ Maya style , dressed as a Teotihuacan warrior , bearing the central Mexican atlatl spear @-@ thrower not adopted by the Maya , and carrying a shield adorned with the face of the Mexican god Tlaloc . The reverse of the stela bears a lengthy hieroglyphic inscription detailing the history of Tikal , including the Teotihuacan invasion that established Yax Nuun Ayiin I and his dynasty . 
 In the Early Classic period the Maya kings began to dedicate a new stela , or other monument , to mark the end of each k 'atun cycle ( representing 7 @,@ 200 days , just under 20 sidereal years ) . At Tikal , the first to do so was king Kan Chitam who ruled in the late 5th century . Stela 9 from the city is the first dated monument raised to mark off a period of time , it was raised in 475 . 
 = = = Late Classic = = = 
 In the Late Classic the sculpted images of rulers on stelae remained much the same as in the Early Classic , appearing in profile in the foreground and filling almost the entire available space , which is delimited by a frame . Imagery associated with the Mesoamerican ballgame started to appear in the Maya lowlands in the Late Classic Period . Maya kings are depicted as warriors wearing costume from the Mexican highlands , including elements such as the foreign god Tlaloc and the <unk> serpent . Such imagery appears in the Late Classic on stelae from Naranjo , Piedras Negras and the Petexbatún cities of Dos Pilas and Aguateca . At Dos Pilas , a pair of stelae represent the king of the city in costume forming a jaguar and eagle pairing , characteristic of the Mexican warrior cult . Stelae were being erected by the Maya across the entire central and southern Maya lowlands by 790 , an area that encompassed 150 @,@ 000 square kilometres ( 58 @,@ 000 sq mi ) . 
 In the north , Coba on the eastern side of the Yucatán Peninsula raised at least 23 large stelae . Although badly eroded their style and texts link them to cities from the Petén Basin . At the southern periphery of the Maya region , Copán developed a new high @-@ relief style of stelae and in 652 the twelfth king Chan Imix K 'awiil arranged a series of these stelae to define the sacred geometry of the city , and to celebrate his royal rule and his ancestors . His son and successor Uaxaclajuun Ub 'aah K 'awiil further developed this new high @-@ relief style of sculpture and erected a series of intricately decorated stelae in the city 's Great Plaza that brought the carving of stelae close to full in @-@ the @-@ round three @-@ dimensional sculpture . Both of these kings focused on their own images on their stelae and emphasised their place in the dynastic sequence to justify their rule , possibly linked to a break in the dynastic sequence with the death of the eleventh king of Copán . 
 After Quiriguá defeated its overlord Copán in 738 , it brought massive blocks of red sandstone from quarries 5 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 1 mi ) from the city and sculpted a series of enormous stelae that were the biggest monolithic monuments ever raised by the Maya . Stela E stands over 10 metres ( 33 ft ) high and weighs more than 60 tons . These stelae were shaped into a square cross @-@ section and were decorated on all four faces . These stelae usually bear two images of the Quiriguá king , on the front and the back , in a lower relief than that found at Copán . They feature highly complex panels of hieroglyphic text that are among the most skillfully executed of all Maya inscriptions in stone . The stelae have weathered well and display fine precision on the part of the sculptors . 
 = = = Terminal Classic = = = 
 The decline in the erection of stelae is linked to the decline in the institution of divine kingship , which began in the Late Preclassic . Originally the stelae depicted the king with symbols of power , sometimes standing over defeated enemies and occasionally accompanied by his wives or his heir . By the Terminal Classic , kings were sharing stelae with subordinate lords , who also played a prominent role in the events depicted . This reflected a decentralisation of power and the bargaining between high @-@ ranking nobles so that the king could maintain power , but led to a progressive weakening of the king 's rule . As the position of the king became weaker and that of his vassals and subordinates became stronger , the latter began to erect their own stelae , a function that was formerly the exclusive preserve of the king himself . Some of these subordinates broke away to form their own petty states , but even this did not last and they also ceased to erect monuments . 
 In the Pasión River region of Petén , rulers began to be portrayed as ballplayers on stelae . Seibal was the first site in the region to depict its rulers thus . Seventeen stelae were erected at Seibal between 849 and 889 , and show a mix of Maya and foreign styles , including a lord wearing the beaked mask of Ehecatl , the central Mexican wind god , with a Mexican @-@ style speech scroll emerging from the mouth . Some of these have a stylistic affinity with the painted murals at Cacaxtla , a non @-@ Maya site in the central Mexican state of Tlaxcala . This hybrid style seems to indicate that the kings of Seibal were Maya lords adapting to changing political conditions by adopting a mix of symbols originating from both lowland Maya and central Mexican sources . Some of the more foreign @-@ looking stelae even bear non @-@ Maya calendrical glyphs . Stelae at <unk> , to the north in the Puuc region of the Yucatán Peninsula , divided the face of the stela into up to three levels , each of which contained a different scene , usually of a lone figure that could be either male or female . The representation of the human figure differed from the formal treatment in the south , and were simplified , coarse representations lacking individuality amongst sociopolitical and religious symbols . 
 As the Classic Maya collapse swept across the Maya region , city after city ceased to erect stelae recording its dynastic achievements . At the important city of Calakmul , two stelae were raised in 800 and three more in 810 , but these were the last and the city fell into silence . At <unk> the last stela was raised in 859 . Stela 11 , dated to 869 , was the last monument to ever be erected at the once great city of Tikal . The last known Maya stelae bearing a Long Count calendrical date are Toniná Monument 101 , which was erected in 909 to mark the k 'atun ending that year , and Stela 6 from <unk> , dated to 910 . 
 = = = Postclassic = = = 
 At Copán ritual offerings were deposited around the city 's stelae until at least 1000 , which may represent the offerings of a surviving elite that still remembered its ancestors , or may be due to highland Maya still regarding the city as a place of pilgrimage long after it had fallen into ruin . At Lamanai in Belize , Classic period stelae were repositioned upon two small Postclassic platforms dating to the 15th or 16th century . At La Milpa , also in Belize , at around the time of Spanish contact in the late 16th century a tiny remnant Maya population started to make offerings of Conquest @-@ period pottery to stelae , perhaps in an effort to invoke the ancestors to help resist the Spanish onslaught . A plain stela in Twin Pyramid Group R at Tikal was removed by the local inhabitants some time during the Postclassic ; its accompanying altar was also moved but abandoned some distance from its original location . Some plain stelae were raised at <unk> in the Petén Lakes region of Guatemala in the Postclassic ; these were perhaps covered in stucco and painted . This may represent a revival of the <unk> @-@ ending ceremonies that occurred in the Classic Period , and reflected ties with the northern Yucatán . 
 = = Discovery = = 
 One of the earliest accounts of Maya stelae comes from Diego Garcia de Palacio , a Spanish colonial official who described six of the stelae at Copán in a letter to king Philip II of Spain written in 1576 . Juan Galindo , governor of Petén , visited Copán in 1834 and noted the sculpted high @-@ relief stelae there . Five years later , American diplomat John Lloyd Stephens and British artist Frederick Catherwood arrived in war @-@ torn Central America and set out for Copán , describing fifteen stelae in Stephens ' Incidents of Travel in Central America , Chiapas and Yucatán , published in 1841 . Stephens and Catherwood noticed the presence of red pigment on some of the Copán stelae . Stephens unsuccessfully attempted to buy the ruins of Quiriguá , and purchased Copán for US $ 50 ( $ 1 @,@ 100 in 2016 ) with the idea of shipping the stelae to New York for display in a new museum . In the event , he was prevented from shipping the monuments down the Copán River by the discovery of impassable rapids and all the stelae remained at the site . While Stephens was engaged on business elsewhere , Catherwood carried out a brief investigation of the stelae at Quiriguá but found them very difficult to draw without a camera lucida due to their great height . Ambrosio Tut , governor of Petén , and colonel Modesto Méndez , the chief magistrate , visited the ruins of Tikal in 1848 accompanied by Eusebio Lara , who drew some of the monuments there . In 1852 Modesto Méndez went on to discover Stela 1 and Stela 5 at Ixkun . English explorer Alfred Maudslay arrived at Quiriguá in 1881 and cleared the vegetation from the stelae , then travelled on to see the stelae at Copán . In the early 20th century , an expedition by the Carnegie Institution led by American Mayanist Sylvanus Morley discovered a stela at Uaxactun . This period marked a change from the efforts of individual explorers to those of institutions that funded archaeological exploration , excavation and restoration .

 Notable collections of stelae on public display include an impressive series of 8th @-@ century monuments at Quiriguá and 21 stelae collected in the sculpture museum at Tikal National Park , both of which are World Heritage Sites in Guatemala . Calakmul , in Mexico , is another World Heritage site that also includes many stelae regarded as outstanding examples of Maya art . Copán in Honduras , also a World Heritage Site , possesses over 10 finely carved stelae in the site core alone . 
 The Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología ( " National Museum of Archaeology and Ethnology " ) in Guatemala City displays a number of fine stelae , including three 9th @-@ century stelae from Machaquilá , an 8th @-@ century stela from Naranjo and other stelae from <unk> , Kaminaljuyu , La Amelia , Piedras Negras , Seibal , Tikal , Uaxactun and Ucanal . The Museo Nacional de Antropología ( " National Museum of Anthropology " ) in Mexico City has a small number of Maya stelae on display . The San Diego Museum of Man in California contains replicas of the stelae from Quiriguá that were made in 1915 for the Pacific @-@ California Exhibition . 
 Many Maya archaeological sites have stelae on display in their original locations , in Guatemala these include , but are not limited to , Aguateca , Dos Pilas , El Chal , Ixkun , Nakum , Seibal , Takalik Abaj , Uaxactun , and Yaxha . In Mexico , stelae may be seen at Yaxchilan , and the site museum at Toniná . 
 = = Looting = = 
 Stelae have become threatened in modern times by plundering for sale on the international art market . Many stelae are found in remote areas and their size and weight prevents them from being removed intact . Various methods are used to cut or break a stela for easier transport , including power saws , chisels , acid and heat . When a monument is well preserved , the looters attempt to cut off its face for transport . Even when successful , this results in damage to inscriptions on the sides of the stela . At worst , this method results in complete fragmentation of the stela face with any recoverable sculpture removed for sale . <unk> fragments of well known monuments have been purchased by American museums and private collectors in the past . When such monuments are removed from their original context , their historical meaning is lost . Although museums have justified their acquisition of stelae fragments with the argument that such objects are better preserved in an institution , no stela has been sold in as good a condition as it was in its original location . After 1970 there was a sharp drop in Maya stelae available on the New York art market due to the ratification of a treaty with Mexico that guarantees the return of stolen pre @-@ Columbian sculpture that was removed from the country after the ratification date . In the early 1970s some museums , such as that of the University of Pennsylvania , responded to international criticism by no longer purchasing archaeological artefacts that lack a legally documented history , including place of origin , previous owners and an export license . Harvard University also instituted a similar policy in the early 1970s . 
 In 1972 , the initially well preserved Stela 5 at Ixkun was smashed into pieces by looters , who heated it until it shattered and then stole various pieces . A number of remaining fragments of the monument were rescued by archaeologist Ian Graham and transferred to the mayor 's office in Dolores , Petén , where they were eventually used as construction material before once again being recovered , this time by the Atlas Arqueológico de Guatemala in 1989 , and moved to their archaeological laboratory . At the nearby site of <unk> , 7 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 4 @.@ 7 mi ) from Ixkun , most of the stelae were robbed before the site 's existence was reported to the Guatemalan authorities . By the time archaeologists visited the site in 1985 only 2 stelae remained . 
 In 1974 , a dealer in pre @-@ Columbian artefacts by the name of Hollinshead arranged for the illegal removal of Machaquilá Stela 2 from the Guatemalan jungle . He and his co @-@ conspirators were prosecuted in the United States under the National Stolen Property Act and they were the first people to be convicted under this act with reference to national patrimony laws . The act states : 
 " whoever transports , transmits , or transfers in interstate or foreign commerce any goods ... of the value of $ 5 @,@ 000 or more , knowing the same to have been stolen , converted or taken by fraud ... [ s ] hall be fined under this title or imprisoned not more than ten years , or both ... " [ w ] <unk> receives , possesses , conceals , stores , <unk> , sells , or disposes of any goods .. . which have crossed a State or United States boundary after being stolen , unlawfully converted , or taken , knowing the same to have been stolen , unlawfully converted , or taken ( is subject to fine or imprisonment ) . " 
 The act was originally intended to discourage the handling of stolen property but several courts have judged that the National Stolen Property Act is sufficiently broad in scope to apply to goods crossing into the United States from a foreign nation , and is therefore applicable in the case of stolen cultural property . 
 Under Guatemalan law , Maya stelae and other archaeological artefacts are property of the Guatemalan government and may not be removed from the country without its permission . In the case of Machaquilá Stela 2 , the monument was well known before it was stolen and its illegal removal was easy to prove . The stela itself was cut into pieces , with the face being sawn off and moved to a fish packing factory in Belize , where it was packed into boxes and shipped to California . There it was seized by the Federal Bureau of Investigation after being offered for sale to various institutions . The stolen portion of the stela was returned to Guatemala and is now in storage at the Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología in Guatemala City . 
 Looting has been linked to the economic and political stability of the possessing nation , with levels of looting increasing during times of crisis . It also appears that art collectors have stelae , or portions of them , stolen to order by browsing archaeological books and catalogues for desirable pieces . Examples of this may be found at Aguateca and El Perú , both in Guatemala 's Petén department , where only the better preserved hieroglyphs and human faces were cut away . 
 = Alone ( The X @-@ Files ) = 
 " Alone " is the nineteenth episode of the eight season and the 180th episode overall of the science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . The episode first aired in the United States on May 6 , 2001 on Fox , and subsequently aired in the United Kingdom on Sky1 on June 14 , 2001 . It was written and directed by executive producer Frank Spotnitz . " Alone " earned a Nielsen household rating of 7 @.@ 5 and was viewed by 12 @.@ 7 million viewers . It received mixed to positive reviews from television critics . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents John Doggett ( Robert Patrick ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) — as well as ex @-@ FBI agent Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) — who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . In this episode , Doggett is paired with an enthusiastic young agent named Leyla Harrison who knows everything about the X @-@ Files , when Scully goes on maternity leave . Harrison 's apotheosis of Mulder and Scully leads to Doggett learning a thing or two . But when Harrison and Doggett disappear , Mulder defies orders in an attempt to find them . 
 " Alone " marked the directorial debut of Spotnitz , who had been a writer on the show for several years . In addition , the episode would be the last Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week episode to feature an appearance by David Duchovny as Fox Mulder . The character of Leyla Harrison was named after an X @-@ Files fan who died of cancer in 2001 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In Ellicott , New York , Arlen Sacks is killed by an unknown creature that sprays venom on its victims , and his son Gary goes missing . In the meantime , at the FBI headquarters , Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) , preparing for maternity leave , packs up her belongings at the X @-@ Files office . Scully finds a medallion commemorating the Apollo 11 space flight that was given to her for her birthday by Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) . Scully gives John Doggett ( Robert Patrick ) the medallion , explaining that it symbolizes teamwork . After Scully leaves , Special Agent Leyla Harrison arrives and tells Doggett that she is his new partner . The two are soon assigned to investigate Sacks ' bizarre murder . 
 At the crime scene , Doggett and Harrison search for clues . Doggett finds evidence of the venom , which is sent to an FBI lab for analysis . Harrison explains to Doggett that in her previous job she processed Mulder and Scully 's travel expenses during their time on the X @-@ Files , and has thus gained an encyclopedic knowledge of their investigations . Following a wooded trail from the crime scene , Doggett and Harrison stumble upon an upscale mansion and make their way inside . A strange creature clinging to the wall secretly observes their every move . Doggett discovers a study full of biology journals and a copy of the anthropologist Richard Leakey 's book The Sixth Extinction . Doggett pulls out his gun , sensing that something is amiss , and finds Harrison in the hallway . He then instructs Harrison to position herself outside while he tries to flush the creature out of the house . Moments after Doggett instructs Harrison to stand guard he hears gun shots being fired . Rushing outside , he cannot find Harrison anywhere in the yard . He walks farther to the edge and falls through a trap door at the edge of the front lawn . 
 During an autopsy , Scully correctly deduces that Arlen was blinded by reptile venom . Meanwhile , Doggett and Harrison , having fallen into old bootlegger tunnels below the mansion grounds , encounter the creature and are sprayed with venom , temporarily blinding them . The two find Gary Sacks in dire need of medical attention nearby . Noting Doggett and Harrison 's absence , Mulder searches the area around the mansion for clues and encounters the owner , Herman Stites , who identifies himself as a biologist . Mulder soon leaves the area as Stites notices Doggett about to escape the tunnels and knocks him back in . Mulder waits in his car in Stites ' driveway until dark , telling Scully that he found the Apollo medallion near Stites ' estate and is convinced Doggett is somewhere nearby . He spots the creature and chases it to the mansion where it climbs up to a second floor . Mulder follows the creature into the house and down into the tunnels , where he encounters Harrison and Doggett . With the creature approaching , Mulder tells the still @-@ blinded Doggett to open fire at him on his command . The blinded Doggett then shoots the creature as it leaps at Mulder ; the deceased creature then turns into Stites . 
 Later , Scully and Mulder meet Doggett , who has now fully recovered , at the hospital . He tells them that Harrison will make a full recovery as well but that she is transferring herself off of the X @-@ Files . Mulder attempts to give Doggett the Apollo medallion , but Doggett insists that it be given to Harrison instead . Mulder and Scully then present it to Harrison together , who accepts it in awe .

 = = = Writing and directing = = = 
 The episode was written by executive producer Frank Spotnitz , and marked his directorial debut . Because of his position as both the writer of the episode and the director , Spotnitz later noted that it was hard to achieve perfection when filming the episode . However , he did note that , as both the writer and director , he had more creative control than usual . Originally Spotnitz did not have plans to direct the episode but was encouraged to do so by David Duchovny ; Duchovny reminded Spotnitz that it would be the last Monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ Week ( stand alone ) episode to feature his character , Fox Mulder . After production and shooting was finalized , the rough cut of " Alone " was nine minutes over time and in order to compensate for the time , various sections were cut during final editing . Robert Patrick was very pleased with Spotnitz 's work , stating , " You 're talking about some incredibly intelligent individuals , and they were very willing to let you , as an artist , discover what they were trying to do with the role . That 's a wonderful environment to work in . " 
 For the episode , Gillian Anderson 's character Dana Scully was written off as a member of The X @-@ Files office , since the next season would mark the creation of the " new " X @-@ Files with Robert Patrick and Annabeth Gish taking over for Duchovny and Anderson . Because of this change , Spotnitz called " Alone " the last of the " old " X @-@ Files stand @-@ alone episodes . As with many other episodes , Duchovny did not want his character to have all the answers , giving the reason that it looked too easy for him . Duchovny and Spotnitz later had a long discussion on how to remove the scenes or tweak them . Unfortunately , because the episode was the last stand @-@ alone episode to feature the character of Fox Mulder , Duchovny did not care as much as " usual " about creating a " mystery " for the episode . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 Walter Skinner ( Mitch Pileggi ) appeared in the episode only because Spotnitz did not want to miss the opportunity to direct an episode of The X @-@ Files that featured his character . However , because the episode was over time , Spotnitz ended up editing a large majority of his more " prominent " scenes out . In addition , another section that was scripted but ultimately cut was a scene between Anderson and Duchovny . Jolie Jenkins ' character , Leyla Harrison , was created and named in memory of a The X @-@ Files internet fan and prolific writer of fan fiction of the same name , who died of cancer on February 10 , 2001 . Jenkins ' characterization , according to Spotnitz , brought out the " Clint [ Eastwood ] " of Robert Patrick 's character John Doggett and her performance was called " near perfection " by Spotnitz during the audio commentary for this episode . 
 Due to Harrison 's extensive knowledge of the X @-@ Files , the episode contains several references to previous episodes . While looking through her desk drawer , Scully finds the merged coin from the sixth season entry " Dreamland " ; the Apollo 11 space flight medallion , which was given to her by Mulder in the fourth season episode " Tempus Fugit " ; and her dog Queequeg 's name tag , which she was given in the third season episode " Clyde Bruckman 's Final Repose " . While investigating , Harrison mentions a liver @-@ eating mutant that produced bile and died under an escalator , a reference to Eugene Victor Tooms , who appeared in the first season episodes " Squeeze " and " Tooms " ; aliens that shed their skin and leave behind a residue similar to mucus , a reference to the alien from " The Beginning " ; and subterranean men in Florida who took people underground , as featured in " Detour " . While searching through Stites ' house , Doggett finds a book entitled The Sixth Extinction , a potential reference to the seventh season episode of the same name . In the episode 's final scene , Harrison asks Mulder how he and Scully managed to return to America after escaping from a spaceship in Antarctica , a reference to an event that took place at the end of the 1998 X @-@ Files feature film .

 " Alone " debuted on Fox on May 6 , 2001 in the United States . The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 7 @.@ 5 , meaning that it was seen by 7 @.@ 5 % of the nation 's estimated households . The episode was viewed by 7 @.@ 56 million households , and 12 @.@ 7 million viewers . The episode ranked as the 35th most @-@ watched episode for the week ending May 6 . On June 14 , 2001 , the episode premiered in the United Kingdom and Ireland on Sky1 and received 480 @,@ 000 viewers making it the sixth most watched episode that week , behind Star Trek : Voyager and The Simpsons . Fox promoted the episode with the tagline " Don 't watch alone . " 
 The episode was met with mixed to positive reviews . Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode an " A – " , applauded Duchovny 's apparent energy to be acting on the series once again . However , he felt that the " <unk> " of the episode resulted in many scenes coming off as too on @-@ the @-@ nose or strained . Television Without Pity gave the episode a B – rating but slightly criticized the way Fox was using Duchovny , sardonically writing , " I don 't know if you 're aware of this , but David Duchovny stars in The X @-@ Files . Did you know that ? Because they 've really been keeping it under wraps at Fox . " John Keegan from Critical Myth gave the episode a 7 out of 10 rating . Keegan called the episode a " homage to fandom " and described the tone as " warm [ and ] fuzzy . " Because of this , he concluded that " [ o ] verall , this was an episode that dealt with the emotional needs of the audience in a way that was less effective than it might have been . " 
 Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , rated the episode three and a half stars out of five and called it " an exercise in nostalgia " . The two called the episode " touching " and noted that many of the in @-@ jokes in the script , such as Harrison asking the agents how they got back from Antarctica , were " very funny " . Shearman and Pearson , however , did slightly critique the way the X @-@ Files were presented noting that the case was comparatively a " rather low @-@ key humdrum affair " . Tom Kessenich , in his book Examinations , gave the episode a positive review , writing , " The future of The X @-@ Files is unsettled , but ' Alone ' served as a pleasant reminder of what has come before and why the journey to this point has , for the most part , been so wonderful . " 
 Not all reviews were positive . Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a largely negative review and awarded it one star out of four . She derided the plot , writing " Why ? Who knows ? Who cares ? " Vitaris further criticized the episode incorporation of the fandom and suggested that some of the questions asked by Harrison were meant to be " making fun " of " fannish questions " . 
 = Quiriguá = 
 Quiriguá ( Spanish pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ) is an ancient Maya archaeological site in the department of Izabal in south @-@ eastern Guatemala . It is a medium @-@ sized site covering approximately 3 square kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 sq mi ) along the lower Motagua River , with the ceremonial center about 1 km ( 0 @.@ 6 mi ) from the north bank . During the Maya Classic Period ( AD 200 – 900 ) , Quiriguá was situated at the juncture of several important trade routes . The site was occupied by 200 , construction on the acropolis had begun by about 550 , and an explosion of grander construction started in the 8th century . All construction had halted by about 850 , except for a brief period of reoccupation in the Early Postclassic ( c . 900 – c . 1200 ) . Quiriguá shares its architectural and sculptural styles with the nearby Classic Period city of Copán , with whose history it is closely entwined . 
 Quiriguá 's rapid expansion in the 8th century was tied to king K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat 's military victory over Copán in 738 . When the greatest king of Copán , Uaxaclajuun Ub 'aah K 'awiil or " 18 @-@ Rabbit " , was defeated , he was captured and then sacrificed in the Great Plaza at Quiriguá . Before this , Quiriguá had been a vassal state of Copán , but it maintained its independence afterwards . The ceremonial architecture at Quiriguá is quite modest , but the site 's importance lies in its wealth of sculpture , including the tallest stone monumental sculpture ever erected in the New World . 
 = = Name and location = = 
 The archaeological site of Quiriguá is named after the nearby village of the same name , and is located a little over 200 km ( 120 mi ) northeast of Guatemala City ; it lies in the municipality of Los <unk> in the department of Izabal and has an elevation of 75 m ( 246 ft ) above mean sea level . 
 Positioned on the north bank of the lower reaches of the Motagua River , Quiriguá is situated at the point where the valley broadens into a flood plain , which has exposed the site to periodic flooding over the centuries . Although the river passed close to the site during the period of the city 's occupation , it has since changed course and now flows 1 km ( 0 @.@ 6 mi ) south of the ceremonial centre . Quiriguá is 48 km ( 30 mi ) north of Copán , and is located 15 @.@ 7 km ( 9 @.@ 8 mi ) north @-@ west of the international border with Honduras . 
 The local bedrock is a hard red sandstone , which the inhabitants used in the construction of monuments and architecture . This local sandstone is very strong and not prone to shearing or fracturing , allowing the sculptors at Quiriguá to erect the tallest freestanding stone monuments in the Americas . Quiriguá was built directly over the Motagua Fault and the city suffered damage in ancient times as a result of major earthquakes . 
 = = Population = = 
 Although the Quiriguá elite were clearly Maya in ethnicity , the site lies on the southern periphery of the Mesoamerican area and the population was at least bi @-@ ethnic , with ethnic Maya in a minority . The majority of the population belonged ethnically to the less complex Intermediate Area lying beyond the eastern border of Mesoamerica . The population density of the site has been estimated at 400 to 500 per square kilometer ( 1040 to 1300 per square mile ) in the centre of the city during the Late Classic with an estimated peak population of 1200 – 1600 ; surveys have revealed an average of 130 structures per square kilometer ( 338 per square mile ) at the site , compared with 1449 structures / km2 ( <unk> per square mile ) in central Copán . The low population density indicates that Quiriguá served as the focus for a dispersed rural population . 
 The population levels of the Quiriguá valley increased rapidly after the successful rebellion against Copán in 738 , although it was never a heavily populated site . In the 9th century there was a severe decline in population , culminating in the abandonment of the city . 
 = = Economy = = 
 The Motagua River flows down from the western Guatemalan highlands , and Quiriguá was ideally positioned to control the trade of uncut jade , the majority of which was found in the middle reaches of the Motagua Valley , as well as controlling the flow of other important commodities up and down the river such as cacao , which was produced as a local cash crop . Although cacao was produced for trade , maize remained the primary local crop due to its central role in the Maya diet . In addition , maize probably formed an important component in the site 's tribute payments to its overlords at Copán , a city that was exhausting its own local resources . Although little jade has been recovered from the site , there is evidence for trade in obsidian originating from the <unk> source situated near the upper reaches of the Motagua . 
 In the Classic Period , the location of the site would have placed Quiriguá on a crossroads between the trading route from the highlands to the Caribbean coast and the route from Copán to the major cities of the Petén Basin . 
 = = Known rulers = = 
 As recorded on hieroglyphic inscriptions at Quiriguá , all dates are AD . Maya inscriptions for rulers sometimes include reference to a number ( " hel @-@ number " or count , named after its main glyph ) that are believed to specify the position of that ruler in the sequence of dynastic succession to the rulership of the site . Thus a hel @-@ number of five indicates the ruler was fifth in the line of dynastic succession . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early history = = = 
 There is evidence that Quiriguá was occupied as early as the Late Preclassic ( 400 BC – AD 200 ) . Although no structures have been securely dated to this period , a number of Late Preclassic artifacts have been recovered , including 63 figurines and a chert blade . Early Classic ceramics from Quiriguá are similar to finds at both Copán and Chalchuapa in El Salvador , while jade hunchback figurines from the same period resemble those found in central Honduras and in the Guatemalan highlands . These early finds demonstrate the participation of Quiriguá in the wider southeastern Maya region from the Late Preclassic onwards . 
 A combination of hieroglyphic texts from Tikal , Copán and Quiriguá , together with architectural styles and chemical tests of the bones of the founder of the Copán dynasty all suggest that Quiriguá and Copán were founded by elite colonists from the great city of Tikal as a part of its expansion into the southeastern border area of the Maya region . The recorded history of Quiriguá starts in 426 , in the Early Classic ( c . 200 – c . 600 ) ; according to hieroglyphic inscriptions at other sites , on 5 September of that year K 'inich Yax K 'uk ' Mo ' was enthroned as king of Copán . Just three days later he installed " Tok Casper " , the first known king of Quiriguá , upon the throne . From this it is evident that right from the beginning of its recorded history Quiriguá was subservient to its southern neighbour , and was founded to bring the lucrative trade route of the Motagua River under the control of Copán and , indirectly , of Tikal . During the next few centuries , about which little is known , the ceremonial architecture at Quiriguá was limited to the hilltop Group A and a broad earthen platform on the valley floor . It is recorded that a stela , as yet undiscovered , was erected in 455 by <unk> Yohl K 'inich , the second king of Quiriguá . An early monument records the supervision of a ritual in 480 by the then overlord from Copán , demonstrating Quiriguá 's continued status as a vassal of that city . A hieroglyphic text dating to 493 mentions two further kings of Quiriguá , but interruptions in the text make the reading and decipherment of their names particularly difficult . 
 There are close parallels between the 5th @-@ century architecture and monuments of Quiriguá and Uaxactun in the northern Petén , a site that fell under the domination of Tikal in the late 4th century . The similarities show that Quiriguá remained strongly aligned with the great Tikal alliance network . 
 = = = Hiatus and recovery = = = 
 Quiriguá suffered a hiatus from the turn of the 6th century that lasted through to the middle of the 7th century . This may be linked to the Tikal hiatus of the Middle Classic caused by Tikal 's defeat by Calakmul . There is evidence that Quiriguá suffered an attack by unknown enemies in this period , as demonstrated by the apparently deliberate defacement of Stela U and Monument 26 , characteristic of damage inflicted by invading warriors . No monuments were erected during this hiatus , which lasted from 495 to 653 . 
 In the 6th or early 7th century a natural disaster caused a devastating flood of the Motagua Valley and buried the surface of the site under a deep layer of silt , completely changing the landscape . Only those buildings that stood above the mud continued in use , including group A , saved by its hilltop location . The earthen platform on the valley floor also continued in use , at least those parts of it that stood above the silt , and it was one of the site 's smaller complexes that grew to become the new centre of Quiriguá , as represented by the monuments visible to this day . 
 A revival can be identified by the dedication of the first new monument in a century and a half , raised by the otherwise unknown king , K 'awiil Yopaat , in 653 . Continued contact with Copán is evident , as well as longer distance contacts , possibly with Caracol in Belize . At about the same time major construction work was undertaken in the acropolis , including the building of the site 's first ballcourt . 
 = = = Apogee = = = 
 Quiriguá traditionally had been subordinate to its southern neighbour , Copán , and in 724 Uaxaclajuun Ub 'aah K 'awiil , king of Copán , installed K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat upon Quiriguá 's throne as his vassal . As early as 734 , however , K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat had shown that he was no longer an obedient subordinate of Copán when he started to refer to himself as k 'ul ahaw , holy lord , instead of using the lesser term ahaw , subordinate lord ; at the same time he began to use his own Quiriguá emblem glyph . These early assertions of independence can only have been made if Quiriguá had managed to form an external alliance . 
 Indeed , this local act of rebellion appears to have been part of the larger political struggle between the two Maya " superpowers " , the great cities of Tikal and Calakmul . In 736 , only two years later , K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat received a visit from Wamaw K 'awiil , the high king of distant Calakmul , while Copán was one of Tikal 's oldest allies . The timing of this visit by the king of Calakmul is highly significant , falling between the accession of K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat to the throne of Quiriguá as a vassal of Copán and the outright rebellion that was to follow . This strongly suggests that Calakmul sponsored Quiriguá 's rebellion in order to weaken Tikal and to gain access to the rich trade route of the Motagua Valley . It is likely that contact with Calakmul had been initiated soon after K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat acceded to the throne , since Quiriguá experienced rapid growth soon after , suggesting that Quiriguá already was receiving external support . 
 In 738 the interlinked fortunes of Quiriguá and Copán took a stunning change of direction when K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat , reigning lord of Quiriguá , captured the powerful , but elderly 13th king of Copán , Uaxaclajuun Ub 'aah K 'awiil , who had installed him on his throne in 725 . This coup does not seem to have affected either Copán or Quiriguá physically , there is no evidence that either city was attacked at this time and the victor seems not to have received any detectable tribute . Quiriguá seems rather to have gained its independence and the control of important trade routes . An inscription at Quiriguá , although difficult to interpret , suggests that the capture took place on 27 April 738 , when Quiriguá seized and burned the wooden images of Copán 's patron deities . All of this seems to imply that K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat managed to somehow ambush Uaxaclajuun Ub 'aah K 'awiil , rather than to have defeated him in outright battle . In the Classic Period the statues of Maya deities often were carried into battle on palanquins , facilitating their capture in the event of defeat . It has been suggested that the king of Copán was attempting to attack another site in order to secure captives for sacrifice , and was ambushed by K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat and his Quiriguá warriors . 
 The captured lord was taken back to Quiriguá and on 3 May 738 he was decapitated in a public ritual . The sacrificial offering of the blood of such a powerful overlord greatly enhanced the standing of Quiriguá and its royal family throughout the region and it proclaimed Quiriguá as the new capital of the south @-@ eastern Maya region . After this , Quiriguá engaged in a major monument @-@ building programme , closely mimicking the sculptural style of Copán , possibly using captured Copán sculptors to carry out the work . The population of Quiriguá and of other sites in the valley rapidly increased after the events of 738 , although Quiriguá was always a small centre and its total population probably never exceeded 2 @,@ 000 . 
 In the Late Classic ( c . 600 – c . 900 ) , alliance with Calakmul frequently was associated with the promise of military support . The fact that Copán , a much more powerful city than Quiriguá , failed to retaliate against its former vassal implies that it feared the military intervention of Calakmul . Calakmul itself was far enough away from Quiriguá that K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat was not afraid of falling directly under its power as a full vassal state , even though it is likely that Calakmul sent warriors to help in the defeat of Copán . The alliance instead seems to have been one of mutual advantage , Calakmul managed to weaken a powerful ally of Tikal while Quiriguá gained its independence . 
 In 718 , the city of Xkuy – an as yet undiscovered site – was attacked and burned by Copán under the leadership of king Uaxaclajuun Ub 'aah K 'awiil . After the king of Copán was sacrificed in 738 , Xkuy seems to have become a loyal vassal of Quiriguá and in 762 K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat supervised the accession of " <unk> Jaguar " to the subservient city 's throne . 
 K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat , who had so dramatically changed the destiny of his city , died on 27 July 785 . Zoomorph G is his memorial stone and it describes how he was buried 10 days later in the 13 <unk> House , a building that has not been identified . The great king was succeeded by " Sky Xul " , a king whose name has not been properly identified . " Sky Xul " became the reigning lord of Quiriguá 78 days after the death of K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat , who is thought to have been his father . His reign lasted from 10 to 15 years and was a period of continued activity . In most of the Maya region cities already were suffering terminal decline , engulfed by the Classic Maya collapse , but in Quiriguá " Sky Xul " dedicated three great zoomorph sculptures and two altars , considered marvels of Maya <unk> . " Sky Xul " died some time between 795 and 800 . 
 = = = Decline and collapse = = = 
 Little is known of " Jade Sky " , who succeeded " Sky Xul " and was the last recorded ruler of Quiriguá . The city 's power already was waning , as evidenced by the two stunted stelae erected during his reign , which indicate that the kingdom no longer had access to the kind of resources needed to produce monuments of a similar quality to those of his predecessors . " Jade Sky " did build two of the largest structures in the acropolis , however . 
 Quiriguá apparently retained its independence from Copán and continued to flourish until the beginning of the 9th century . Relations between the two cities had improved somewhat by 810 , when king Yax Pasaj Chan Yopaat of Copán visited Quiriguá in order to carry out a k 'atun @-@ ending ritual . However , 810 was also the year when the last hieroglyphic texts were raised at Quiriguá , although a reduced level of construction continued in the city centre . After this , Quiriguá falls into silence , engulfed by the greater phenomenon of the Classic Maya collapse – it had lost its reason for existence when trade no longer flowed along the Motagua ; within a few years Quiriguá was all but deserted and sites throughout the Motagua Valley suffered severe decline or abandonment . 
 = = = Postclassic = = = 
 In the early Postclassic Period ( c . 900 – c . 1200 ) , Quiriguá was occupied by peoples closely linked to the Caribbean coastal areas of the Yucatán Peninsula and Belize , perhaps due to Chontal Maya control of a trade network that included the Yucatán coast and the Motagua Valley . During their brief reoccupation of the site they made substantial additions to the acropolis complex . Finds associated with their occupation include a reclining <unk> sculpture and ceramics from the east coast of Yucatán , artifacts that demonstrate a close link with the distant city of Chichen Itza . Some copper bells and ornaments were recovered from Quiriguá , they are among the earliest finds of metal artifacts in the Maya area . They have been dated to either the Terminal Classic ( c . 800 – c . 950 ) or the Early Postclassic . 
 = = = Modern history = = = 
 The first European visitor to publish an account of Quiriguá was English architect and artist Frederick Catherwood , who reached the ruins in 1840 . The previous landowner , by the surname of Payés , had related the existence of the ruins to his sons and to Carlos <unk> , a Jamaican Englishman resident in Guatemala . The elder Payés had recently died and passed the land to his sons and , since neither <unk> nor Payés ' sons had visited the land containing the ruins , they invited John Lloyd Stephens and Catherwood to join them on their first trip to the site . Stephens had other duties to attend to , but Catherwood was able to accompany the Payés brothers to Quiriguá . Due to adverse conditions he was only able to stay a short time at the ruins , but made drawings of two of the stelae , which were published with a short account of Catherwood 's visit in John Lloyd Stephens 's book Incidents of Travel in Central America , Chiapas , and Yucatan in 1841 . Quiriguá was the first site that Stephens and Catherwood could claim to have discovered themselves . A longer account of the ruins was made in 1854 by Dr. Karl Scherzer . 
 Explorer and archaeologist Alfred Maudslay visited Quiriguá for three days in 1881 ; they were the first pre @-@ Columbian ruins that he saw and they were sufficiently impressive to inspire him to take up a permanent interest in Central American archaeology . He was able to return on three further occasions , the last being in 1894 , and he made the first efforts to clear the monuments before recording them . He carried out a very thorough examination and made a photographic record of all visible monuments , carried out some minor excavations , made paper and plaster molds of the hieroglyphic inscriptions and surveyed the principal sculptures ; these molds were then shipped to the Victoria and Albert Museum , with casts being transferred to the British Museum . 
 In 1910 , the United Fruit Company bought Quiriguá and all the land for a great distance around the site for banana production ; they set aside 75 acres ( 30 ha ) around the ceremonial centre as an archaeological park , leaving an island of jungle among the plantations . More archaeological work was carried out from 1910 to 1914 by Edgar Lee Hewett and Sylvanus Morley for the School of American Archaeology in Santa Fe . <unk> of the stelae of Quiriguá made from Hewitt 's plaster casts of the originals were exhibited at the Panama @-@ California Exposition in San Diego , California , in 1915 . The casts are still on display at the San Diego Museum of Man in their " Maya : Heart of Sky , Heart of Earth " exhibition . The Carnegie Institution conducted several intermittent projects at Quiriguá from 1915 through 1934 . Aldous Huxley , writing after visiting the site in the early 1930s , noted that Quiriguá 's stelae commemorated " man 's triumph over time and matter and the triumph of time and matter over man . " Quiriguá was among the first Maya archaeological sites to be studied intensively , although little restoration was carried out and the ruins once again became overgrown with jungle . 
 Quiriguá was declared a National Monument in 1970 under Ministerial Accord 1210 , this was followed on 19 June 1974 by its declaration as an Archaeological Park under Governmental Accord 35 @-@ 74 . 
 From 1974 through 1979 , an extensive archaeological project was conducted at Quiriguá sponsored by the University of Pennsylvania , the National Geographic Society , and the Guatemalan Instituto de Antropología e Historia . Directed by Robert Sharer and William R. Coe , the project excavated the acropolis , cleaned the monuments , and studied outlying groups . It was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1981 , and in 1999 UNESCO approved one @-@ off funding of US $ 27 @,@ 248 for " emergency assistance for the rehabilitation of the archaeological site of Quiriguá " . One of the site 's stelae is depicted on the Guatemalan 10 centavo coin . 
 The 34 @-@ hectare ( 84 @-@ acre ) area included within the Archaeological Park of Quiriguá has been developed for tourism with the construction of a car park , site museum , and sanitation facilities and is open to the public on a daily basis .

 After Quiriguá 's pivotal victory over Copán in 738 , K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat rebuilt the main group in the image of Copán itself . Thus , the acropolis , palace , and ballcourt all lie at the southern end of the Great Plaza . The ceremonial centre is laid out around three plazas , the northernmost is the Great Plaza . This plaza measures 325 m ( 1 @,@ 066 ft ) from north to south and is the largest plaza in the whole Maya region . At the southern end of the Great Plaza is the Ballcourt Plaza , surrounded on three sides by structures associated with the acropolis . The Acropolis Plaza is a fully enclosed plaza within the acropolis itself . The area to the west of the Ballcourt Plaza was probably the riverside docking area and there is evidence that the southern part of the Great Plaza was a marketplace . A number of ceramic @-@ lined wells have been excavated close to the site core , these were all built in the 8th century and although some continued in use into the 9th century , none are known to have been built that late . 
 1A @-@ 1 is an enormous platform forming the northern part of the Great Plaza . It measures 100 by 85 metres ( 328 by 279 ft ) and rises 0 @.@ 5 metres ( 20 in ) above the level of the southern part of the plaza . It forms the northern portion of the Great Plaza , being built by K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat when he extended the plaza northward . The platform was built from river cobbles and was paved with stone slabs . Platform 1A @-@ 1 supported the stelae A , C , D , E and F and Zoomorph B. The platform was built in two phases over about 20 years . 
 1A @-@ 3 is a large mound marking the northern edge of the Great Plaza . It originally measured 82 @.@ 5 by 20 metres ( 271 by 66 ft ) and was 7 metres ( 23 ft ) high . A 63 @-@ metre ( 207 ft ) wide stairway climbed the southern face of the structure from the plaza . The structure was later extended to the north but this second phase of construction was never finished . 
 The acropolis is the largest architectural complex at Quiriguá , it lies at the southern limit of the ceremonial centre of the city . It is a complex construction , with new buildings and features being added over time . Construction of the acropolis began in 550 and continued through to 810 when the site was abandoned . The acropolis was a palace complex used primarily as an elite residence and for administrative purposes . The acropolis complex includes structures 1B @-@ 1 , 1B @-@ 2 , 1B @-@ 3 , 1B @-@ 4 , 1B @-@ 5 and 1B @-@ 6 . Excavations of the acropolis encountered the fallen remains of corbel arches , but none are still standing . 
 1B @-@ <unk> is also known as the K 'inich Ahau Wall . It was a free @-@ standing wall over 23 metres ( 75 ft ) long and 1 @.@ 5 metres ( 5 ft ) thick , it stood on top of the western platform of the acropolis . The western side of the wall overlooked the river and bore five alternating mosaic masks representing solar deities and serpents with human arms . These masks were supported by a frieze consisting of two concentric ovals flanked by serpent heads . The wall was completed around 750 , during the reign of K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat . 
 1B @-@ <unk> Excavations at the acropolis discovered a completely buried ballcourt under the structures on the western side of the Acropolis Plaza , a rare example of a ballcourt having been built over by subsequent construction , in this case by K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat . This was the first ballcourt at the site and dates to the middle of the 7th century . It was built with blocks of rhyolite . This ballcourt is a close copy of the ballcourts at Copán , being built in the same style , to the same dimensions , and with the same orientation . The ballcourt was buried when K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat built the massive western platform to restrict access to the acropolis . 
 1B @-@ 1 is a structure which forms the southern limit of the Acropolis Plaza , a broad stairway leads down to the plaza from the northern side of the building . The lower walls of the structure are still standing and it has three entrances , each of which opens onto a small chamber . Each of the three chambers has a hieroglyphic step on the back wall leading to another small chamber . Originally the building had an external band of hieroglyphs . Both the exterior and internal glyphs bear the last known date recorded at Quiriguá , falling in June 810 . This building was built during the reign of " Jade Sky " . 
 1B @-@ 2 also lies south of the Acropolis Plaza , in the southwest corner . It is smaller than structure 1B @-@ 1 , which it adjoins , and its lower walls also are still standing . It was a small residential building that was elaborately decorated with sculptured stonework . This structure was probably the residence of K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat . 
 1B @-@ 3 and 1B @-@ 4 are structures on the west side of the Acropolis Plaza , only the lower walls remain . Between these two structures is an older free @-@ standing wall . This wall has a westward facing mosaic frieze that bears damaged and now headless depictions of <unk> Ahau , the sun god . 
 1B @-@ 5 lies to the north of the Acropolis Plaza , at the south @-@ eastern corner of the Ballcourt Plaza . This structure was accessed via a broad stairway from the Acropolis Plaza to the south , which rises to a single entrance opening onto seven interconnected chambers . This is the largest building at Quiriguá and its walls are still standing . It was built during the reign of " Jade Sky " . 
 1B @-@ 6 lies to the east of the Acropolis Plaza and contained an ancestral shrine , reflecting a long established tradition first seen at Tikal . Located under the building was a tomb lined with slabs of schist , which contained an elite burial . The remains probably belonged to a male , the teeth were inlaid with jade , and a bead of the same material had been placed in the mouth . Associated ceramic offerings date this tomb to the Early Classic . 
 1B @-@ 7 is a ballcourt , built by K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat to replace the ballcourt buried under his expansion of the acropolis . The ballcourt lies in the Ballcourt Plaza , to which it gives its name , to the northwest of the acropolis . The ballcourt has an east – west orientation that is unusual in the Maya region , where ballcourts traditionally are aligned north – south . 
 3C @-@ 1 is a broad earthen platform on the valley floor , it dates to the middle of the Classic Period and is one of the earlier constructions at the site , parts of it continuing in use after a catastrophic flood . 
 3C @-@ 7 is a group dating to the Early Classic . It is on the floodplain some distance to the north of the acropolis . 
 3C @-@ 8 is another Early Classic group located to the north of the acropolis . 
 Locus 011 and Locus 057 may have been <unk> , they were situated at the points where the Quiriguá and the <unk> rivers entered the Motagua Valley and may have been used to control passing traffic on these routes . Locus 057 was situated on one of the most probable routes to Copán and may have been a <unk> to look out for enemy warriors after the defeat of Copán by K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat . 
 Locus 122 and Locus 123 are groups located on the floodplain south of the river . Locus 122 , although unexcavated , is a compound consisting of a pyramidal mound and a NE – SW oriented plaza , similar to some Preclassic complexes in the highlands , for which reason it is presumed to date from that period . 
 Groups A , B and C lie at a distance of one to three miles from the site core . 
 Group A is a hilltop complex roughly dating to the early Classic Period . A stela found in this group dates to 493 . 
 Group B , also known as Group 7A @-@ 1 , is to the north of the site core . It is the location of the badly eroded Stela S , which was moved here from the Great Plaza in ancient times . 
 Group C has an <unk> stela . 
 = = = Monuments = = = 
 The monuments at Quiriguá include unusually large stelae elaborately carved from single blocks of red sandstone , brought from quarries 5 kilometres ( 3 mi ) away . The characteristics of this hard rock allowed the local sculptors to produce low @-@ relief sculptures enhanced by three @-@ dimensional faces , in contrast with the contemporary two @-@ dimensional sculpture of the Petén region . After the defeat and execution of the king of Copán in 738 , the sculptural style of Quiriguá closely resembled that of its former overlord . The enormous stelae at <unk> originally would have been visible from the Motagua River , which once flowed past the west side of the Great Plaza , announcing the new @-@ found power of the city to passing traders . The monuments include long panels of glyphic text that are considered among the most complex and beautiful of all Maya stone inscriptions . A characteristic of these texts is the use of full @-@ figure glyphs in which the normal bar and dot number glyphs of Maya script are replaced with exquisitely carved representations of the deities . However , by the latter part of the 8th century Quiriguá had developed an original style with the production of boulders elaborately sculpted into the forms of composite mythological animals bearing elements of toads , jaguars , crocodiles , and birds of prey ; these sculptures are referred to as <unk> and were completed by two later kings after the death of K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat in 785 . 
 There also are various altars and sculptures used as decoration in the facades of buildings ; most Quiriguá monuments have a grand formal monumentality that is rather stiff compared to the naturalistic grace of the art of some other Maya sites . Traces of red pigment have been found on some of the monuments and most of the monuments were likely to have been painted red , the colour of birth , sacrifice , and renewal . 
 Stela A was erected in 775 by K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat . Stela A and Stela C form a pair and were both dedicated on 29 December 775 . 
 Zoomorph B was dedicated in 780 by K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat , it is a multi @-@ ton boulder sculptured into a half @-@ crocodile half @-@ mountain beast . The hieroglyphic text on this monument consists entirely of full @-@ figure glyphs . Traces of red pigment have been found on this zoomorph , which is 4 metres ( 13 ft ) long . A dedication cache was found buried in a pit under Zoomorph B , it included seven flint blades between 14 and 46 cm ( 5 @.@ 5 and 18 @.@ 1 in ) in length . 
 Stela C was erected in 775 by K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat . The hieroglyphic text contains references to 455 and <unk> Yohl K 'inich , an early king . The stela also bears a reference to the date 13 @.@ 0 @.@ 0 @.@ 0 @.@ 0 4 <unk> 8 <unk> 'u ( 13 August 3114 BC ) . This date is recorded throughout the entire Maya area as the beginning of the current creation , when the deities were placed in order . Stela C forms a pair with Stela A and was dedicated on the same date . 
 Stela D dates to 766 , during the reign of K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat . It is distinguished by the relatively rare , extravagant , full @-@ figure anthropomorphic versions of Maya hieroglyphics on the upper parts of its sides , which are particularly well preserved . Stela D is roughly 6 metres ( 20 ft ) in height . 
 Stela E stands in the northern half of the Great Plaza . This stela was dedicated on 24 January 771 by K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat . Its total shaft measures 10 @.@ 6 metres ( 35 ft ) in height , including the buried portion holding it in place , which measures just under 3 metres ( 10 ft ) . This enormous monolith is the largest stone ever quarried by the ancient Maya and weighs approximately 65 tons , it may even be the largest free @-@ standing worked monolith in the New World . In 1917 this stela , already tilting away from vertical , finally fell over completely after heavy rains , although it remained unbroken . In 1934 an attempt was made to raise the stela using a winch and steel cables , during which the cables snapped and the monolith fell and was broken into two pieces , which have since been joined back together using concrete . This stela bears portraits of K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat on its front and back . 
 Stela F is an enormous 7 @.@ 3 @-@ metre ( 24 ft ) high monolith carved from sandstone . It bears representations of K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat on its north and south sides and hieroglyphic inscriptions on its east and west sides . It dates to 761 and when it was raised it was the tallest monument ever erected by the Maya ; it was only surpassed when Stela E was erected 10 years later . 
 Zoomorph G is the memorial monument to K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat , dedicated during the reign of " Sky Xul " . It shows the face of the dead king emerging from the maw of an enormous jaguar . The text of this monument describes the death and burial of Quiriguá 's greatest king . 
 Stela H dates to 751 , during the reign of K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat . Its glyphs are arranged in a rare mat pattern , copied from Copán . The stela is executed in the wrap @-@ around style . A flint blade was found buried under the stela butt , buried as an offering when the stela was dedicated . The hieroglyphic inscriptions on Stela H are badly damaged . 
 Stela J was erected by K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat in 756 and is carved in the wrap @-@ around style . It stands 5 metres ( 16 ft ) high and is located in the southern part of the Great Plaza . The dedicatory cache consisted of a house @-@ shaped clay box with unknown contents . 
 Altar L is fairly crudely worked and dates to 653 . The text bears the name of king K 'awiil Yopaat and also mentions " Smoke Imix " , the 12th king of Copán . The altar is a rhyolite disk 1 metre ( 39 in ) in diameter and 0 @.@ 25 metres ( 10 in ) thick . The sculptural style of this altar is unique , and shows affinities with the distant site of Caracol in Belize . 
 Altar M this modest monument is the earliest known monument dedicated by K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat . The importance of this monument lies in its text , in which this preeminent king of Quiriguá claimed the title of k 'uhul ajaw , holy lord , and began his bid for independence from Copán . This rhyolite sculpture was dedicated on 15 September 734 and has the form of a monstrous head , possibly that of a crocodilian . 
 Altar N is another small rhyolite sculpture stylistically similar to Altar M. This sculpture has the form of a turtle shell with a skeletal head with a mirror on its forehead emerging sideways from one end and an elderly figure from the other . This is a representation of the <unk> deity Pawatun ( God N ) , a prominent underworld deity . 
 Zoomorph O is a crocodile @-@ mountain hybrid monster , dedicated in 790 by king " Sky Xul " . It is accompanied by an altar depicting a lightning god . It is located in the Ballcourt Plaza , just south of the ballcourt itself . 
 Zoomorph P ( which explorer Maudslay nicknamed The Great Turtle ) was dedicated in 795 by " Sky Xul " and is a masterpiece of Mesoamerican art . It weighs around 20 tons . On one side it depicts a larger @-@ than @-@ life portrait of " Sky Xul " himself seated cross @-@ legged in the open jaws of an enormous crocodile @-@ mountain hybrid monster . The design of this zoomorph is incredibly intricate and the whole monument is covered with skilfully executed sculpture . It is located in the Ballcourt Plaza , just south of the ballcourt . Zoomorph P is accompanied by an altar depicting an unidentified deity leaping from a split in the earth . A hieroglyphic text on the zoomorph describes the founding of Quiriguá under the supervision of the king of Copán . Traces of red pigment have been found on this monument , suggesting that it was originally painted red . 
 Altar Q and Altar R are two small rhyolite disks that probably served as ballcourt markers for the earliest ballcourt , the buried Structure 1B @-@ <unk> Together with a third stone they would have marked the central axis of the ballcourt . They both bear seated cross @-@ legged figures carved in shallow relief . 
 Stela S is the earliest surviving monument of K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat , it dates to 746 . It was originally located in the northern half of the Great Plaza but was moved to an outlying group in ancient times . It is heavily eroded , some of the damage may have been inflicted by the process of moving it . It was fashioned from sandstone and bears the figure of K 'ak ' Tiliw Chan Yopaat on the front , the other three sides being covered by hieroglyphic text . Unfortunately , due to the heavy erosion most of the text is illegible . Stela S is 2 @.@ 8 metres ( 9 ft ) high ( not including the part of the stela buried in the ground ) and the dimensions of the base are 1 @.@ 6 metres ( 5 @.@ 2 ft ) by 1 @.@ 2 metres ( 3 @.@ 9 ft ) , making it the earliest of the huge stelae that were to characterise Quiriguá , although it is significantly smaller than those that were to follow . 
 Stela T was dedicated in 692 by an unknown ruler . It is a badly eroded schist sculpture bearing mostly unreadable glyphs accompanying a poorly preserved figure . The stela is conservative in style , being similar to the much older Stela U. 
 Stela U comes from Group A and bears a heavily eroded portrait of a king in wrap @-@ around style ( extending over three sides of the stela ) . This style originated in Tikal and indicates contact with the central Petén region . This stela has an identifiable date , corresponding to 18 April 480 , and a reference to a ritual taking place that was supervised by the king of Copán . This stela is carved from schist and is broken in two pieces , being snapped off at the knees – apparently deliberately during an attack by unknown enemies . It was originally 2 @.@ 7 metres ( 9 ft ) in height . 
 Monument 25 is a plain round column carved from schist . It is about 2 @.@ 5 metres ( 8 ft ) long and 0 @.@ 6 metres ( 2 ft ) in diameter . It was found in Locus 011 . 
 Monument 26 is a stela in wrap @-@ around style found close to structure 3C @-@ 1 . A date corresponding to 493 is contained in the hieroglyphic text on its back , this text mentions the third and fourth rulers of Quiriguá but their names are currently unreadable . It is carved from schist and was originally 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) high but the stela was broken in ancient times , apparently deliberately . It was broken off at the knees and the left eye of the ruler 's portrait was scratched away , damage characteristic of that inflicted by invading warriors . Only two pieces have been recovered , an upper section measuring 1 metre ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) and a lower section measuring 0 @.@ 6 metres ( 2 ft ) . 
 Monument 29 and Monument 30 are heavily eroded columnar sculptures fashioned from schist , each measuring a little over 1 m in length . They were found together in a modern drainage ditch to the north and northwest of the ceremonial centre of Quiriguá . They apparently were sculptures of <unk> or monkeys standing on pedestals with their hands clasped on their chests . It is thought on stylistic grounds that these two monuments date to the Late Preclassic .

 = William D. Boyce = 
 William Dickson " W. D. " Boyce ( June 16 , 1858 – June 11 , 1929 ) was an American newspaper man , entrepreneur , magazine publisher , and explorer . He was the founder of the Boy Scouts of America ( BSA ) and the short @-@ lived Lone Scouts of America ( LSA ) . Born in Allegheny County , Pennsylvania , he acquired a love for the outdoors early in his life . After working as a schoolteacher and a coal miner , Boyce attended Wooster Academy in Ohio before moving to the Midwest and Canada . An astute businessman , Boyce successfully established several newspapers , such as The Commercial in Winnipeg , Manitoba and the Lisbon Clipper in Lisbon , North Dakota . With his first wife , Mary Jane Beacom , he moved to Chicago to pursue his entrepreneurial ambitions . There he established the Mutual Newspaper Publishing Company and the weekly Saturday Blade , which catered to a rural audience and was distributed by thousands of newspaper boys . With his novel employment of newsboys to boost newspaper sales , Boyce 's namesake publishing company maintained a circulation of 500 @,@ 000 copies per week by 1894 . Boyce strongly supported worker rights , as demonstrated by his businesses ' support of labor unions and his concern for his newsboys ' well @-@ being . 
 By the early years of the 20th century , Boyce had become a multi @-@ millionaire and had taken a step back from his businesses to pursue his interests in civic affairs , devoting more time to traveling and participating in expeditions . In 1909 , he embarked on a two @-@ month trip to Europe and a large photographic expedition to Africa with photographer George R. Lawrence and cartoonist John T. McCutcheon . Over the next two decades , Boyce led expeditions to South America , Europe , and North Africa , where he visited the newly discovered tomb of King Tutankhamun . 
 Boyce learned about Scouting while passing through London during his first expedition to Africa in 1909 . According to somewhat fictionalized legend , Boyce had become lost in the dense London fog , but was guided back to his destination by a young boy , who told him that he was merely doing his duty as a Boy Scout . Boyce then read printed material on Scouting , and on his return to the United States , he formed the B.S.A. From its start , Boyce focused the Scouting program on teaching self @-@ reliance , citizenship , resourcefulness , patriotism , obedience , cheerfulness , courage , and courtesy in order " to make men " . After clashing over the Scouting program with the first Chief Scout Executive James E. West , he left the B.S.A. and founded the <unk> in January 1915 , which catered to rural boys who had limited opportunities to form a troop or a patrol . In June 1924 , five years before Boyce 's death , a merger was completed between the B.S.A. and the struggling <unk> Boyce received many awards and memorials for his efforts in the U.S. Scouting movement , including the famed " Silver Buffalo Award " . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Boyce was born on June 16 , 1858 in New Texas , Pennsylvania — now Plum Borough — to a Presbyterian farm couple , David and Margaret Jane Bratton Boyce . The <unk> had three children : William Dickson , Mary , and John . During his rural childhood , Boyce acquired a love for the outdoors . He began teaching school at the age of 16 and then worked briefly as a coal miner . He returned to teaching before joining his sister at Wooster Academy in Ohio , which — according to school records — he attended from 1880 to 1881 . It is uncertain if he graduated or was expelled . He then worked as a teacher , lumberjack , secretary , and salesman in the Midwest and Canada before settling in Chicago , where he quickly became known as a persuasive and shrewd salesman and learned business quickly . His books on business , travel , and expeditions often used the phrase " We pushed on . " On January 1 , 1884 , Boyce married Mary Jane Beacom ( 1865 – 1959 ) , whom he had known since his Pennsylvania childhood . Boyce called her Betsy , but to many her nickname was " Rattlesnake Jane " because she matched his skill in poker , was an expert shot , and rode horses cross saddle . They had one son and two daughters : Benjamin Stevens ( 1884 – 1928 ) , Happy ( 1886 – 1976 ) and Sydney ( 1889 – 1950 ) . Boyce 's personal activities included hunting , yachting , Odd Fellows , Freemasonry , Shriners , golf , country clubs and the Chicago Hussars — an independent equestrian military organization . 
 In 1903 , Boyce purchased a four @-@ story mansion on 38 acres ( 15 ha ) in Ottawa , Illinois , which became the center of his family and social activities . Thereafter , he showed little interest in Chicago and its social activities ; he would only go there on business . Boyce and Mary led increasingly separate lives and eventually divorced , which was reported on the front page of the Chicago Tribune because of the prominence he had attained by that time . The divorce was finalized in a Campbell County , South Dakota court in September 1908 ; his wife 's property settlement was close to $ 1 million ( USD ) . 
 After the divorce was finalized , Boyce courted Virginia Dorcas Lee , a vocalist from Oak Park , Illinois , who was 23 years his junior and the eldest child of Virginia and John Adams Lee , a former Lieutenant Governor of Missouri . Both Virginia 's parents and Boyce 's son Ben opposed the relationship . In May 1910 , after the planned marriage was announced , an infuriated Ben scuffled with his father outside the Blackstone Hotel and Boyce sustained a facial wound . Ben was arrested for disorderly conduct and fined $ 5 and court costs . Two days later , Boyce and Virginia married and went to Europe on an extended honeymoon . Almost immediately , there was speculation amongst family members and in newspapers about problems within the marriage . On April 9 , 1911 , Boyce and Virginia had a daughter , whom they named Virginia . A few months later , in December 1911 , Boyce signed an agreement to support and educate their infant daughter . After Boyce 's wife filed for divorce in March 1912 , she moved to Santa Barbara , California , with their daughter and her parents . Boyce did not contest the divorce and arranged for a $ 100 @,@ 000 settlement . Years later , the elder Virginia married Richard Roberts , a New York banker , and moved with her and Boyce 's daughter to Greenwich , Connecticut . The younger Virginia took the surname Roberts . She did not meet her natural father , Boyce , until she was eight years old . 
 Ben married Miriam Patterson of Omaha , Nebraska , on June 11 , 1912 . Both Boyce and his first wife attended the ceremony . At this time Boyce 's first wife , Mary , exchanged some of her Chicago property for the home in Ottawa , which sparked speculation that she and Boyce might reconcile . The next year they remarried on June 14 , 1913 , in Ottawa . They then departed on a honeymoon to Alaska , Hawaii , the Philippines , Panama , and Cuba , with their daughter Happy , son Ben , and his wife Miriam . 
 = = Business enterprises = = 
 As Boyce traveled , he often started a newspaper wherever he went . His first venture into commercial publishing was compiling a city directory . He also worked briefly for a publisher in Columbus , Ohio , and a newspaper publisher in Kensington , Pennsylvania , part of Philadelphia . He then boarded a train for Chicago and worked as a secretary and salesman for " Western " magazine . Restless again , he moved to Saint Paul , Minnesota , and sold advertisements for a publisher for a short time and then spent a month in Fargo , North Dakota , and Grand Forks , North Dakota . Further north in Canada , in Winnipeg , Manitoba , he and local resident James W. Steen co @-@ founded " The Commercial " in 1881 , a newspaper that lasted for 70 years . He sold his share of " The Commercial " to his partner in 1882 and returned to Fargo where he became a reporter . In December 1882 , Boyce moved to Lisbon , North Dakota , where he bought the Dakota Clipper . 
 Beginning in December 1884 , Boyce managed reporters and news releases at the " Bureau of Correspondence " at the six @-@ month @-@ long World 's Industrial and Cotton Centennial Exposition in New Orleans , Louisiana . Countries from all over the world sent displays . Boyce was responsible for providing news stories on events and displays to over 1 @,@ 200 newspapers around the country . He returned to North Dakota after the Exposition concluded , but by early 1886 he had moved back to Chicago . He often returned in North Dakota for publishing business deals and <unk> and duck @-@ hunting vacations . 
 In Chicago , he founded the Mutual Newspaper Publishing Company in 1886 which provided advertisements and articles to over 200 newspapers . In 1887 , he established the weekly " Saturday Blade " , an illustrated newspaper aimed at rural audiences and sold by thousands of newsboys — an innovation at the time . By 1892 , the Saturday Blade had the largest circulation of any weekly newspaper in the United States . Boyce 's detailed reports of his foreign travels provided articles for the " Saturday Blade " and were reprinted in books by atlas / map publisher Rand McNally . The success of the " Saturday Blade " spawned the W. D. Boyce Publishing Company , which Boyce used to buy or start several newspapers and magazines . In 1892 , Boyce bought out the " Chicago Ledger " , a fiction weekly publication . In January 1903 he founded the international " Boyce 's Weekly " , which advocated worker 's rights . Boyce 's prominence as a supporter of labor attracted labor / union leaders such as John Mitchell of the United Mine Workers and Henry Demarest Lloyd as writers and editors for " Boyce 's Weekly " . Eight months later , " Boyce 's Weekly " was consolidated with the " Saturday Blade . " Boyce also established the selected subject / topical newspapers " Farm Business " in 1914 and " Home Folks Magazine " in 1922 . Dwindling sales led to the 1925 merger of the " Blade " and " Ledger " into the monthly " Chicago Blade & Ledger " , which was published until 1937 . As Boyce 's enterprises grew , he insisted on looking after the welfare of about 30 @,@ 000 delivery boys , who were key to his financial success . Working with them may have helped him gain an understanding of America 's youth . Boyce felt that delivering and selling newspapers taught a youth important responsibilities such as being polite , reading human nature , and handling money . Boyce 's focused determination was evident in the advice he gave to young men : " There are many obstacles to overcome , but toil , grit and endurance will help you to overcome them all . Help yourself and others will help you . " and " whatever trade you have selected ; never swerve from that purpose a single moment until it is accomplished " . 
 In 1891 , Boyce began working on his own 12 @-@ story office building at 30 North Dearborn Street , known as the " Boyce Building " , it was designed by architect Henry Ives Cobb . Even 20 years later , this building was recognized as the most expensive building ( in terms of dollars per cubic foot ) in Chicago . In 1907 , Boyce consolidated his business operations into another office building , also known as the Boyce Building , at 500 – 510 North Dearborn Street . A new four @-@ story office building — designed by the architectural firm of Daniel Burnham — was built on this location in 1912 and expanded during 1913 – 14 with an additional six stories . This building was later listed on the National Register of Historic Places on February 29 , 1996 , maintained by the United States Department of the Interior and its National Park Service . 
 At a time when women had trouble finding work and workers were often oppressed , Boyce felt their rights were important : his businesses employed many women and he supported labor unions . His newspapers often carried stories about the " nobility of labor " . His businesses were able to pay out wages and benefits during the Panic of 1893 , a time when many businesses were laying off workers and cutting wages . During the Pullman Strike of the Pullman Palace Car Company in 1894 , which spread to 20 companies in over half the states , Boyce called Eugene V. Debs , the socialist labor national leader of the American Railway Union , a " great labor leader " and industrialist George Pullman , inventor of the railroad passenger and sleeping car , the man " who caused all the trouble " ( then current labor and social / political strife of the 1890s ) . In 1901 when the Boyce Paper Manufacturing Company in Marseilles , Illinois , burned down , he paid the workers immediately and then hired them back as construction workers to rebuild the paper mill so they would not lose income . Yet , he was also protective of his money . In late 1894 , when two of his workers were injured by a fallen smokestack and won $ 2 @,@ 000 each in a court judgment , Boyce appealed the case all the way to the Supreme Court of Illinois , and lost . He was also persistent in getting what he wanted ; in 1902 , he sued the Marseilles Land and Power Company for not supplying enough water power to his mills and won a $ 65 @,@ 300 judgment . By 1903 , the Marseilles Land and Power Company fell into receivership and Boyce bought the company up . 
 Boyce hired his son , Ben , when he was 20 years old , giving him high @-@ level positions in his water and power businesses in and around Marseilles and Ottawa . However , their relationship was often strained by Boyce 's high expectations and Ben 's carelessness with his funds in activities such as betting on horse races . 
 During June – August 1906 , the government proposed quadrupling the postage rate for second @-@ class mail , which included newspapers , from one cent to four cents per pound . In response , Boyce proposed buying the Post Office Department for $ 300 million ( USD ) , claiming that he would reduce postal rates by half , eliminate chronic deficits by applying business methods to postal operations , establish a rural postal express , pay rent to the United States Department of the Treasury for postal buildings , and return profits over seven percent . This offer was rejected by the government , but it did halt their planned second @-@ class postage rate increase . 
 Boyce was a multi @-@ millionaire by the early 1900s and by 1909 became more interested in civic affairs and less in finance . He also began to travel , often as part of hunting expeditions . He leased hunting lodges at Fort Sisseton , South Dakota , where he had hunted as a young man . He often hosted friends and relatives , especially his son , for activities such as hunting , fishing , dinner , poker , and plentiful liquor . These changes may have been in part caused by the destruction of his Ottawa mansion by fire in early 1908 , which was soon rebuilt , followed three months later by the sale of his Marseilles paper mill due to a new law that prevented railroads from negotiating with shippers , and his September 1908 announcement that he and his wife , Mary Jane , were separating . 
 In 1914 Boyce bought two more newspapers , the " Indianapolis Sun " , which he renamed the " Indianapolis Daily Times " , and the " Inter Ocean Farmer " , which he renamed " The Farming Business " . By 1920 , the majority of Americans lived in cities instead of rural areas . Lone Scout , " Saturday Blade " , and " Chicago Ledger " all focused on rural customers and began to falter . Boyce launched " Home Folks Magazine " in an attempt to regain customers . By June 1925 , sales had slipped so much that he merged the latter two titles into the " Blade and Ledger " , which caused sales to rise again . This encouraged Boyce to start " Movie Romances " , one of the first tabloid magazines about movie star romances . 
 Boyce 's success in the publishing business lay in his ability to organize the administration of a business and delegate details to subordinates . He eventually amassed a fortune of about $ 20 million USD . Boyce 's life paralleled Theodore Roosevelt 's in many ways : Both men were products of the Progressive Era , internationally prominent , had concern for children , supported Scouting , were adventurers and outdoorsmen , ( modern @-@ day " environmentalists " ) , and were interested in civic reform . Although Boyce admired and sought to surpass Roosevelt , his only foray into politics was the 1896 Republican primary for a United States Representative ( congressman ) in the U.S. House of Representatives — a bitterly fought campaign which he lost to first @-@ term incumbent George E. Foss . In all likelihood , Boyce met Roosevelt at the Union League Club of Chicago , of which the former had become a member in 1891 . His ambivalent attitude towards government was a common one of the general public during the Progressive Era . However , Boyce 's Republican credentials and monetary contributions earned him an invitation to the presidential inauguration and ball of newly elected successor to " T.R. " , the 27th President , William Howard Taft in March 1909 . 
 = = Expeditions = = 
 Boyce financed an expedition of the explorer Frederick Schwatka to Alaska in 1896 . Schwatka discovered gold near Nome and Boyce reported this success in his newspapers , which led him to finance other Schwatka expeditions as well as those of other adventurers , including a failed expedition to the Yukon River in 1898 . Boyce soon began to carry out his own expeditions . When the United States entered the Spanish – American War in 1898 , Boyce set sail for Cuban waters aboard the ship Three Friends . The nature of the activities of Boyce and this ship are unknown . 
 In March 1909 , Boyce embarked on a two @-@ month trip to Europe , which included a visit to his daughters , who were in Rome . On returning to America , Boyce organized a photographic expedition to Africa with the innovative aerial photographer George R. Lawrence . Boyce met with safari organizers and outfitters and provisioned his expedition in London and Naples . His son Benjamin and Lawrence 's son Raymond were part of the expedition . Cartoonist John T. McCutcheon joined the expedition while they were sailing from Naples to Africa . The group disembarked at Mombasa , Kenya , and was in Nairobi by September . After hiring local porters and guides , the entire expedition totaled about 400 people , about three @-@ fourths of whom were servants . It required 15 train cars to move the people and equipment to the area the expedition was going to explore near <unk> and Lake Victoria . The expedition was a failure because a telephoto lens was neither brought nor subsequently procured , the hot air balloons were not suitable for the conditions on the plains of East Africa , and the cameras were so large and noisy to move into position that the animals were scared away . The members of the expedition had to resort to buying photographs of big game animals from shops in cities such as Nairobi . The expedition did manage to successfully hunt several species of big game animals . 
 In December 1910 , Boyce led a nine @-@ month , 50 @,@ 000 @-@ mile ( 80 @,@ 000 km ) expedition to South America that was extensively reported in his newspapers . In late January 1915 , Boyce sailed to England because of his concern over World War I. He received permission from the American Legation in Switzerland to travel into Germany and Austria for six weeks to report on the industrial and commercial effects of the war on those countries . He sent extensive reports to his newspapers and returned home around April – May . 
 In late 1922 , Boyce departed on another expedition to Africa , this time for six months . Morocco reminded him of the Dakotas , Kansas , Texas , Florida , and Arizona . In Egypt he visited the tomb of Tutankhamun , which had been discovered just a few months earlier . His expedition then went to Luxor and sailed up the Nile River to Edfu , where the houses had no roofs and while he was there it rained and hailed for the first time in decades . Boyce stated that between his two expeditions to Africa , he had shot at least one of every game animal . 
 = = Scouting = = 
 As Boyce 's interest in philanthropy grew , he turned to his childhood experiences in the outdoors as a resource , but could not find a way to channel his charitable ideas and dreams until a fateful stop to England while en route to what became the failed photographic expedition to Africa . Events in London on the way to and from this expedition would lead to the founding of the Boy Scouts of America ( BSA ) , one of many civic and professional organizations formed during the Progressive Era to fill the void of citizens who had become distended from their rural roots . Many youth organizations such as the Woodcraft Indians and Sons of Daniel Boone formed in America in the early 1900s focusing on outdoor character @-@ building activities . The writings and adventures of Theodore Roosevelt contributed to these movements , with their outdoor , nature , and pioneer themes . By the time of his 1922 expedition to Africa , Boyce was so well respected in Scouting that French Boy Scouts in Algeria saluted him and offered to escort him along a trail when they found out he was the founder of BSA and LSA in America . 
 = = = Unknown Scout legend = = = 
 According to legend , Boyce was lost on a foggy street in London in 1909 when an unknown Scout came to his aid , guiding him back to his destination . The boy then refused Boyce 's tip , explaining that he was merely doing his duty as a Boy Scout . Soon thereafter , Boyce met with Robert Baden @-@ Powell , who was the head of the Boy Scout Association at that time . Boyce returned to America , and , four months later , founded the Boy Scouts of America on February 8 , 1910 . He intended to base the program around American Indian lore . This version of the legend has been printed in numerous BSA handbooks and magazines . There are several variations of it , including ones that claim Boyce knew about Scouting before this encounter and that the Unknown Scout took him to Scout headquarters . 
 In actuality , Boyce stopped in London en route to a safari in British East Africa . It is true that an unknown Scout helped him and refused a tip . But this Scout only helped him cross a street ; he did not take him to the Scout headquarters and Boyce never met Baden @-@ Powell . Upon Boyce 's request , the unknown Scout did give him the address of the Scout headquarters , where Boyce went and picked up a copy of Scouting For Boys and other printed material on Scouting . He read this while on safari and was so impressed that instead of making his return to America an around @-@ the @-@ world trip via San Francisco , he returned to the Scout headquarters in London . He volunteered to organize Scouting in America and was told that he could use their manual . While Boyce 's original account does not mention fog , a 1928 account says there was fog . <unk> report no fog on that day in London . 
 = = = Boy Scouts of America = = = 
 The Boy Scouts of America was incorporated on February 8 , 1910 , but it struggled from shortages of cash and leadership in the beginning . Boyce personally donated $ 1 @,@ 000 a month to keep the organization running on the condition that boys of all races and creeds be included , which was at odds with his own expressed belief in the superiority of whites . He was not interested in directing the organization , and turned over the running of the organization to Edgar M. Robinson of the YMCA , who proceeded to recruit the permanent executive board of the BSA . The much @-@ needed leadership and management arrived when the Sons of Daniel Boone and Woodcraft Indians merged with the BSA . 
 Boyce felt that Scouting 's emphasis on outdoor activity was crucial in producing the type of leaders that America needed because youth reared in cities had too much done for them , whereas those from the country had to learn to do things for themselves . Scouting was focused on teaching self @-@ reliance , citizenship , resourcefulness , patriotism , obedience , cheerfulness , courage , and courtesy in order " to make men " . 
 = = = Lone Scouts of America = = = 
 Boyce clashed with James E. West , the BSA 's Chief Scout Executive , over a program for boys who lived too far from town to join a troop . Boyce offered to publish a magazine for the BSA , as long as it was published in Chicago . The National Executive Board of the BSA turned this offer down and shortly thereafter Boyce ceased being active in administrative activities of the BSA , though he remained a staunch supporter of the program . As a result of this and his desire to serve boys who had limited opportunities as he himself did when he was young , Boyce started a new Scouting @-@ related venture : the Lone Scouts of America ( LSA ) on January 9 , 1915 . Reliance on Native American themes gave LSA a distinct Native American flavor : Lone Scouts could form small groups known as " tribes " , the tribe 's treasurer was known as the " wampum @-@ bearer " , and LSA taught boys to respect the environment . Boyce 's annual contribution to the LSA grew to $ 100 @,@ 000 . In both the BSA and the LSA , Boyce was a manager and had little direct contact with the Boy Scouts . Upon his return from reporting on World War I , Boyce immediately began expanding the LSA by starting Lone Scout magazine and hiring Frank Allan Morgan , a noted Chicago Scoutmaster , to lead the LSA . By November 1915 , the LSA had over 30 @,@ 000 members . Warren conferred upon Boyce the title Chief Totem . Youths could join the LSA simply by mailing in some coupons and five cents . By 1916 , the BSA and the LSA were in direct competition for members . In the summer of 1917 , during his annual Dakota hunt , the Gros Ventres Indian tribe made Boyce an honorary chief with the name " Big Cloud " during a three @-@ day ceremony . With America at war , Boyce agreed to the creation of a Lone Scout uniform in late 1917 . Though he had a uniform made for himself , he stipulated that no Lone Scout was required to purchase one . 
 Boyce felt that Lone Scout was the best magazine he had ever done . Lone Scout was so popular that it could not handle all the material that was submitted , so many local and regional Tribe Papers were started . By 1922 , Boyce 's newspaper business was suffering and Lone Scout was losing money — it switched from a weekly to a monthly . Boyce 's racial prejudice was revealed when the racial tensions in Chicago increased in the 1920s . The LSA issued a formal proclamation in late 1920 that it would only accept whites and in 1922 changed the masthead of Lone Scout from " A Real Boys ' Magazine " to " The White Boys Magazine " . 
 The fortunes of the LSA had begun to decline by 1920 when Boyce hired the first professional editor for Lone Scout , George N. Madison . Madison discovered that the LSA 's membership roster was wildly inaccurate : it was full of duplications and inactive members . The reported 490 @,@ 000 Lone Scouts in 1922 was a vastly inflated number . Boyce finally accepted West 's annual offer to merge with the BSA in April 1924 , with the merger formalized on June 16 , 1924 . Some Lone Scouts did not transfer to the BSA , but the BSA continued Lone Scouting as a separate division for another decade , gradually losing its unique programs . Present day Lone Scouts use the standard Cub Scouting and Boy Scouting programs and activities , but are not part of a pack or troop on a regular basis because of factors such as distance , weather , time , disability or other difficulties . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Benjamin Boyce died in 1928 of a heart embolism . His father did not arrive home until after his son 's death . Boyce was so saddened over his son 's death that his own health suffered . One of Boyce 's last efforts was to publish his son 's letters from his South Seas expeditions : Dear Dad Letters from New Guinea . Boyce died from bronchial pneumonia on June 11 , 1929 , in Chicago and was buried in his adopted hometown of Ottawa , Illinois , on June 13 , 1929 , in the Ottawa Avenue Cemetery , with West delivering the eulogy . Boy Scouts maintained an honor guard with an American flag in a heavy rainstorm in two @-@ hour shifts at his Ottawa home and 32 Boy Scouts were chosen as honorary pallbearers . BSA officials sent his widow a telegram that said the entire American nation owed him a debt of gratitude . A statue that commemorates his contribution to the Boy Scouts of America was placed near his grave on June 21 , 1941 , which West dedicated . 
 Boyce was recognized with the Silver Buffalo Award in 1926 , the first year it was awarded , for his efforts in starting the BSA . He was the third recipient , after Baden @-@ Powell and the Unknown Scout . During the BSA 's 50th anniversary in 1960 , 15 @,@ 000 Scouts and several of Boyce 's descendants gathered in Ottawa for a Boyce Memorial weekend . Illinois governor William Stratton delivered the key address and Bridge Street was renamed Boyce Memorial Drive . In 1985 , about 2 @,@ 500 Scouts attended a 75th anniversary pilgrimage in Ottawa , attended by his last surviving child , Virginia , and the Union League of Chicago named Boyce its first Hall of Fame member . Boyce had been a member from 1891 until he died . On December 6 , 1997 , a Scouting museum opened in Ottawa . The W. D. Boyce Council of the BSA is named in his honor . A Pennsylvania State Historical Marker located on Boyce Campus of Community College of Allegheny County in Monroeville , Pennsylvania , recognizes his achievements to Scouting . Not far from the marker is a county park , Boyce Park , that was named for him . A medallion of Boyce is near the White House as part of the The Extra Mile – Points of Light Volunteer Pathway . In 2005 , the BSA introduced the William D. Boyce New Unit Organization Award , presented to the organizer of any new Scouting unit .

 = Bill Lange = 
 William Alexander " Bill " Lange ( / <unk> / ; June 6 , 1871 – July 23 , 1950 ) , also known as " Little Eva " , was an American Major League Baseball center fielder , who played his entire seven @-@ year career for the Chicago Colts and Orphans from 1893 to 1899 . During his time in the Majors , he once led the National League in stolen bases , and was among the seasonal leaders in several other offensive categories including home runs , and batting average . 
 Lange was noted for having a combination of great speed and power , especially for his size . His 6 @-@ foot @-@ 1 @-@ inch ( 1 @.@ 85 m ) , 190 @-@ pound ( 86 kg ) frame was considered large for his era . He is best known for retiring from baseball during the prime of his career to get married , as his future father @-@ in @-@ law forbade his daughter to marry a baseball player . Despite the short @-@ lived marriage , he refused all offers to return as a player . 
 He became a successful businessman after his retirement from baseball . In addition to his success in real estate and insurance , he became a leading figure in Major League Baseball 's efforts to generate interest in the game worldwide . He was enlisted by the leading baseball figures of the day to assist in establishing leagues in several European countries , that could eventually compete against American teams , while also scouting for undiscovered talent . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Born in the Presidio District of San Francisco , California , he ran away from home while still in grammar school to live with his brother in Port Townsend , Washington . It was from there that he moved up to play Minor League Baseball for the Seattle Reds of the Northwestern Baseball League in the early 1890s . When the Northwestern League folded , Lange return the Bay area to play for the Oakland Colonels of the California League . He played one season for the Colonels , then was signed by the Chicago Colts of the National League . 
 = = Major League career = = 
 Lange made his Major League debut on April 27 , 1893 for the Colts , and enjoyed a successful inaugural Major League season . He scored 92 times , hit eight home runs , had 88 runs batted in ( RBIs ) , while also finishing seventh in stolen bases with 47 , and batted .281 . This was the only time he batted under .300 during his Major League career . In the field that season , he played at second base , in right field and center field . He did not start playing center field exclusively until the following season . Lange continued his success in 1894 by raising his batting average to .328 and finishing fifth in the league with 65 stolen bases . 
 Lange achieved his highest league rankings in 1895 . His .389 batting average was fifth in the league and is still the top individual season average in Chicago Cubs 's history . He also finished second in the league in stolen bases with 67 , fifth in home runs with 10 , fifth in on @-@ base percentage with .456 , hit 16 triples , scored 120 runs , and batted in 98 RBIs . 
 Lange had several notable moments during the 1896 season . On July 4 , he stole five bases in one game against the Louisville Colonels , although it was two stolen bases short of the record of seven set by George Gore and Billy Hamilton . During a game on August 31 , he entered baseball lore with a feat that he never actually performed . The game was scoreless in the bottom of the 10th inning when Lange made a diving catch in center field to keep the game scoreless . Later in the inning , Chicago 's first baseman , George Decker attempted to field a thrown ball from third baseman Barry McCormick , but it bounced off and broke his wrist instead . In an effort to get Decker to the hospital adjacent the ballpark , his teammates knocked down several wooden slats of the outfield fence to expedite his journey . However , the two events were confused and it became legend that Lange had crashed through the fence making that acrobatic catch in tenth . Lange finished the season with a .326 batting average , while also stealing 84 bases , second in the league , and finished eighth in league with 16 triples . 
 His success continued into the 1897 season , as he batted .340 , scored 119 runs , and led the league in stolen bases for the only time in his career . His production dropped his last two seasons in the Majors as his runs scored fell to 79 in 1898 and 81 in 1899 , although he still kept his batting averages of .319 and .325 respectively . 
 While he was very popular , his career as a baseball player was not without controversy . He was ejected from a game on at least two occasions , one of which occurred on May 23 , 1897 when he had an on @-@ field fight with Washington Senators second baseman John O 'Brien . On September 16 , 1899 , in a game against the Brooklyn Superbas , umpire Ed <unk> called the game because of darkness with Brooklyn up by two runs . Lange , and other Chicago player surrounded <unk> and proceeded to " knock him around " , with Lange notably " tweaking " the umpire 's ear . 
 = = Retirement = = 
 Lange finished his career on October 15 , 1899 , having announced a few days earlier his intention to retire after the season . His team played a doubleheader that day , winning 7 – 0 against the St. Louis Perfectos , then losing to the Louisville Colonels later that day in a game shortened by darkness . 
 He retired from the game at age 28 , during the prime of his career , so he could marry a woman whose father forbade her to marry a baseball player . In the eyes of the 19th century public , baseball players were popular , but were often looked upon as low class . Lange 's future wife was from his hometown of San Francisco , and her family was very well @-@ to @-@ do . Also , with the prospect of entering into the world of real estate and insurance , he could make much more money than he did as a ball player . Though the marriage ended in a divorce a short time later , he would not take any offers to return to Major League Baseball , despite Chicago 's salary offer of $ 3 @,@ 500 that would have made him the highest paid player in the league . Although his career lasted only seven years , he finished as the decade leader among 1890s Chicago players in batting average , on @-@ base percentage , slugging percentage , and stolen bases . 
 = = Post @-@ career = = 
 Lange became successful in both real estate and insurance in his hometown of San Francisco after he retired from baseball . Lange is also credited in several sources , as being the person who discovered future Chicago Cubs first baseman , manager , and Hall of Famer , Frank Chance , after having watched him play for the local Fresno , California team during the off @-@ season of 1897 . Lange had recommended Chance to the team owner , Jim Hart , but Hart disputed this claim , saying that Henry Harris had recommended Chance to him while Harris was an owner of a San Francisco team in the fall of 1897 . 
 In 1907 , the California State League , a minor league , was declared by organized baseball to be an " outlaw " league . Organized baseball accused the league of harboring players from the Majors Leagues who had violated the reserve clause to join a number of their teams . The league had become a rival to the already established Pacific Coast League ( PCL ) , who , after being an " outlaw " league themselves , had signed the National Agreement with organized baseball , agreeing that they would not harbor blacklisted or banned players from the Major Leagues . A national commission decided that the best way to deal with this situation was to dissolve this outlaw league . They did this by lifting the blacklist on any player already in the State League , which would create competition among all known leagues , for these players . This commission enlisted Lange , who used his influence with the sports editors in the local area to speed up the process . The attempt worked as the PCL successfully lured the Sacramento , California team into joining their league , with many of the players soon to follow . 
 Later , John McGraw of the New York Giants enlisted Lange as his chief European baseball scout , hoping to discover any hidden talent in that untapped market . In 1919 , Ban Johnson , the American League president enlisted Lange as his chief organizer of baseball teams in Europe , mainly in England , France , Belgium , and Italy . Johnson 's plan was for Lange to evaluate talent and establish an International Baseball League that could compete against the American League pennant winning team in an effort to generate greater interest in the game . Lange became part of the board of directors at the YMCA , which helped fund the expedition . Additionally , Washington Senators owner Clark Griffith donated $ 40 @,@ 000 worth of equipment to assist in supplying the new league . 
 Lange died at the age of 79 in his hometown of San Francisco , and is interred at the Holy Cross Cemetery in Colma , California . Two of his nephews played Major League ball as well , Ren , and George " Highpockets " Kelly . George later gained induction into the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1973 . 
 = New York State Route 141 = 
 New York State Route 141 ( NY 141 ) is a north – south state highway in Westchester County , New York , in the United States . It extends for 3 @.@ 49 miles ( 5 @.@ 62 km ) from an interchange with NY 9A in the hamlet of Hawthorne to an intersection with NY 117 in the village of Pleasantville . The route has a very short overlap with NY 100 west of Hawthorne and connects to the southbound direction of the Taconic State Parkway by way of a partial interchange in Hawthorne . Most of NY 141 is a two @-@ lane road that serves residential and commercial areas ; however , the southwesternmost 0 @.@ 2 miles ( 0 @.@ 3 km ) is a four @-@ lane divided highway . 
 NY 141 was established in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York , extending from Hawthorne to Pleasantville as it does today . At one time , the route extended as far south as the hamlet of Eastview 2 @.@ 5 miles ( 4 @.@ 02 km ) southwest of Hawthorne . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 141 begins at a trumpet interchange with NY 9A on the western edge of the hamlet of Hawthorne , located within the town of Mount Pleasant . This junction also serves as the south end of NY 9A 's overlaps with NY 100 . NY 141 initially heads to the northeast as an independent route , following the two ramps not carrying either direction of NY 100 . After just 0 @.@ 1 miles ( 0 @.@ 2 km ) , all four ramps merge into a four @-@ lane divided highway , creating a short overlap between NY 141 and NY 100 . The divided highway ends at Brighton Avenue , the first road that it intersects . NY 100 splits from NY 141 here , following Brighton Avenue southward while NY 141 heads southeastward along the two @-@ lane Broadway , passing through a lightly developed commercial area . After one block , the route intersects Bradhurst Avenue , here a state @-@ maintained street serving as a one @-@ block spur of NY 100 . 
 Just east of Bradhurst Avenue , NY 141 connects to the Taconic State Parkway by way of a partial interchange . The junction has only two connections ; the first links NY 141 to the southbound parkway , while the second leads from the northbound direction of the parkway to NY 141 via West Cross Street . Continuing eastward , the highway passes under the parkway and enters the commercial center of Hawthorne . Here , NY 141 crosses over the Metro @-@ North Railroad before turning northward onto Elwood Avenue . Over the next 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) , NY 141 closely parallels the railroad 's Harlem Line , serving its Hawthorne station as the road heads north . After three blocks , the road and railroad turn to the northeast and begin to run alongside the Saw Mill River Parkway . Elwood Avenue ends shortly after the curve , giving way to Commerce Street . 
 As Commerce Street , NY 141 continues to head to the northeast , passing by a line of businesses in an otherwise residential area between the hamlets of Hawthorne and Thornwood . The route eventually enters the latter 's central business district , where the Saw Mill Parkway and the Harlem Line turn northwestward toward the center of the nearby village of Pleasantville . NY 141 continues on a northern track , however , becoming known as Broadway again as it heads through mostly residential areas on its way into the eastern portion of Pleasantville . It retains the Broadway name to a junction with Bedford Road , from where the route continues as Bedford Road for two blocks before ending at an intersection with NY 117 . Westbound NY 117 enters from the west on Manville Road , while NY 117 east turns north to follow Bedford Road .

 The alignment of NY 141 between Fort Washington Avenue in Hawthorne and the Pleasantville village line was constructed up to state highway standards during the early 20th century . Designated State Highway 1308 ( SH 1308 ) , August 31 , 1915 , the State of New York let a contract to upgrade the 2 @.@ 14 miles ( 3 @.@ 44 km ) alignment with new pavement .

Construction was completed in 1918 , and the state accepted the alignment into the state highway system on March 15 . 
 NY 141 was established in the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . It originally followed Marble Avenue from Thornwood to Pleasantville ; however , it was realigned in the 1940s to follow Broadway between Thornwood and NY 117 , then routed on Bedford Road , in Pleasantville . In the late 1930s , NY 141 was extended southwestward to Eastview by way of modern NY 9A and the now @-@ dismantled Old Saw Mill River Road . This change was reverted on January 1 , 1949 when most of the highway became part of a realigned NY 9A . On September 1 , 1980 , NY 141 was extended two blocks northward after NY 117 was rerouted to follow Manville Road through Pleasantville .

 = USS Philippine Sea ( CV @-@ 47 ) = 
 USS Philippine Sea ( CV / CVA / CVS @-@ 47 , AVT @-@ 11 ) was one of 24 Essex @-@ class aircraft carriers of the United States Navy , and the first ship to be named for the Battle of the Philippine Sea . She was launched on 5 September 1945 , after the end of World War II and sponsored by the wife of the Governor of Kentucky . 
 During her career , Philippine Sea served first in the Atlantic Ocean and saw several deployments to the Mediterranean Sea as well as a trip to Antarctica as a part of Operation Highjump . Sent to the Korean Peninsula at the outbreak of the Korean War , she sent aircraft in support of United Nations ground troops , first during the Battle of Pusan Perimeter and then during the Inchon Landings and the Second Battle of Seoul . She subsequently supported UN troops during the surprise Chinese attack and the Chosin Reservoir Campaign . Philippine Sea saw three tours to Korea during the war , receiving nine battle stars for her service . 
 For the remainder of her service , she operated primarily out of San Diego and San Francisco , seeing several deployments to the Far East and being redesignated an anti @-@ submarine warfare carrier . She was decommissioned on 28 December 1958 and sold for scrap in 1970 .

 Philippine Sea was the last of the 24 Essex @-@ class ships to be completed , among the largest and most numerous capital ships produced for World War II . CV @-@ 47 was ordered simultaneously to Valley Forge and Iwo Jima in June 1943 . 
 The ship was one of the " long @-@ hull " designs of the class , which had begun production after March 1943 . This " long hull " variant involved lengthening the bow above the waterline into a " clipper " form . The increased rake and flare provided deck space for two quadruple 40 @-@ millimeter ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) mounts ; these units also had the flight deck slightly shortened forward to provide better arcs of fire . Of the Essex @-@ class ships laid down after 1942 , only Bon Homme Richard followed the original " short hull " design . The later ships have been variously referred to as the " long @-@ bow units " , the " long @-@ hull group " , or the " Ticonderoga class " . However , the U.S. Navy never maintained any institutional distinction between the long @-@ hull and short @-@ hull members of the Essex class , and applied postwar refits and upgrades to both groups equally . The ship was powered by eight 600 psi Babcock & Wilcox boilers , and Westinghouse geared steam turbines that developed 150 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower that turned four propellers . Like other Essex @-@ class carriers , she had a maximum speed of 33 knots ( 61 km / h ; 38 mph ) . The ship 's cost is estimated at $ 68 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 to $ 78 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 . 
 Like other " long @-@ hull " Essex @-@ class carriers , Philippine Sea had a displacement of 27 @,@ 100 tonnes ( 26 @,@ 700 long tons ; 29 @,@ 900 short tons ) . She had an overall length of 888 feet ( 271 m ) , a beam of 93 feet ( 28 m ) and a draft of 39 feet ( 12 m ) . The ship was powered by 150 @,@ 000 @-@ shaft @-@ horsepower ( 110 @,@ 000 kW ) steam turbines with a designed range of 20 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 37 @,@ 000 km ; 23 @,@ 000 mi ) . While Essex @-@ class carriers typically had a designed maximum speed of 33 knots ( 61 km / h ; 38 mph ) , Philippine Sea only made 30 knots ( 56 km / h ; 35 mph ) on sea trials . The ship had a total crew complement of 3 @,@ 310 . Like other Essex @-@ class ships , she was armed with twelve 38 @-@ caliber 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) dual purpose guns arrayed in four twin and four single mountings , as well as 8 quadruple Bofors 40 mm guns and a variable number of Oerlikon 20 mm cannon . Unlike her sisters , however , Philippine Sea substituted additional Bofors guns for the Oerlikons with forty @-@ four 40 mm ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) guns arrayed in 10 quadruple and two double mounts . 
 The keel of CV @-@ 47 was laid down 19 August 1944 at the Bethlehem Steel Company in Quincy , Massachusetts . Originally , the ship was to be named USS Wright in honor of the Wright brothers , but following the 19 June 1944 Battle of the Philippine Sea , the Navy decided that the ship be named after the battle , and on 13 February 1945 , she was renamed . Construction on the ship continued throughout the summer of 1945 , but Philippine Sea was not completed at the time of V @-@ E Day . The ship was launched on 5 September 1945 , only days after V @-@ J Day and the end of World War II . She was christened by the wife of Governor of Kentucky Albert " Happy " Chandler .

 Philippine Sea commissioned on 11 May 1946 , when Rear Admiral Morton Deyo placed the ship under the command of Captain Delbert Strother Cornwell at the Boston Navy Yard in South Boston , Massachusetts . The ship remained drydocked at the yard for two weeks before sailing for Naval Air Station Quonset Point on 13 June . However , a shortage of men following the post @-@ World War II demobilization forced her to remain at reduced operational status until 23 September when she embarked for sea trials . 
 Returning from trials on 27 September , the carrier embarked Carrier Air Group 20 , which flew two squadrons of Grumman F8F Bearcat fighter aircraft as well as a squadron each of Curtiss SB2C Helldiver dive bombers and Grumman TBM @-@ 3E Avenger torpedo bombers , about 90 aircraft total . She left port 30 September and commenced training en route to Norfolk , Virginia . CVG @-@ 20 Commander Robert M. Milner made the first takeoff from the carrier on 1 October aboard a Bearcat . Philippine Sea departed Norfolk Naval Shipyard 12 October for Cuban waters where she conducted an abbreviated shakedown cruise and training exercises for CVG @-@ 20 's Grumman F8F Bearcats and Curtiss SB2C Helldivers until 20 November . 
 Following these trials , Philippine Sea was assigned to Operation Highjump . She returned to Quonset and disembarked CVG @-@ 20 before sailing for Boston for repairs and alterations . She then headed to Norfolk where Rear Admiral Richard E. Byrd boarded her and she took on six Douglas <unk> @-@ 5 Skytrain transports , two Stinson OY @-@ 1 Sentinel liaison aircraft , and a Sikorsky HO3S @-@ 1 helicopter along with cargo , spare parts , skis and Task Force 68 personnel . She left Norfolk 29 December and stood out of Hampton Roads 2 January 1947 en route to Antarctica . Philippine Sea passed through the Panama Canal 8 January and cleared Balboa by 10 January . By 12 January the ship had crossed the equator in an elaborate ceremony , but on 22 January its HO3S @-@ 1 was lost due to pilot error , though the crew was recovered . Two days later , it met the remaining ships of Task Force 68 . The ship arrived on station on 29 January , 660 miles ( 1 @,@ 060 km ) from Little America , and launched its <unk> in the next few days to explore the Arctic . Commander William M. Hawkes and Byrd both disembarked from Philippine Sea aboard the aircraft to begin their expedition . After her aircraft departed , Philippine Sea returned to Quonset , passing through Balboa again on 22 February and arriving back in port on 27 February . 
 In late March , the carrier embarked Carrier Air Group 9 , which flew two squadrons of <unk> F8F Bearcats and Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters as well as a squadron each of SB2C Helldivers and TBM Avengers , and a detachment of HO3S helicopters for a total of about 100 aircraft . She completed her shakedown cruise at Guantanamo Bay until late May . She continued sea trials in the area until 1 July when she arrived at Gravesend Bay , New Jersey for refit . She was refitted for most of the year at New York Naval Shipyard and Bayonne , New Jersey through 15 November 1947 before conducting trials and training around Quonset and Guantanamo Bay through February 1948 . That month , she became flagship of Carrier Division Four led by Rear Admiral Ralph E. Jennings , who established his command aboard her on 4 February . On 20 February she departed for her first deployment in the Mediterranean Sea as part of Vice Admiral Forrest Sherman 's 6th Fleet . Here she logged 8 @,@ 534 flight hours , including 85 hours of night operations . She returned to Quonset 26 June and for repairs to her catapult machinery . She spent the remainder of the year as a part of the Operational Development Force testing new carrier aircraft doctrine , and her pilots logged 750 hours in 670 carrier controlled approach tests and 314 successful landings . On 22 October she was sent to the North Atlantic to conduct cold @-@ weather landing tests and tested problem landing scenarios along the Arctic Circle until 23 November 1948 . 
 In January 1949 , Philippine Sea returned to Carrier Division Four under Rear Admiral Joseph J. Clark and embarked Carrier Air Group 7 for another tour in the Mediterranean , which had a similar fighter complement . She sailed 4 January with the aircraft carrier Midway and supporting ships . There , she conducted joint exercises with carriers of the British fleet . She returned in late May and began an overhaul at the Boston Naval Shipyard . That fall , the ship returned to the Caribbean to shake down with its new upgrades , this time with Carrier Air Group 1 . For the rest of the year , she continued fleet exercises in the North Atlantic and testing for new jet engine powered fighter aircraft to test their abilities to operate on aircraft carriers . 
 Operating again from her base at Quonset Point , Philippine Sea spent early 1950 qualifying new carrier pilots . During February and most of March , she took part in more fleet exercises throughout the Atlantic . During April and May 1950 she conducted demonstration cruises for guests of the Secretary of the Navy , the Armed Forces Industrial College , Air War College , and the Armed Forces Staff College . On 24 May 1950 , Philippine Sea sailed from Norfolk through the Panama Canal , arriving at her new home port of San Diego to join the Pacific Fleet . She was replaced in the Atlantic Fleet by Oriskany . She was scheduled to begin a tour in the Far East in October 1950 before she was called to combat duty . 
 = = = Korean War = = = 
 With the outbreak of the Korean War on 25 June 1950 , Philippine Sea was ordered to Naval Base Pearl Harbor . She sailed for Hawaiian waters on 5 July with Carrier Air Group 11 embarked , flying four squadrons of Vought F4U Corsair fighter @-@ bombers . The ship departed for Japan on 24 July . Leaving Pearl Harbor , Philippine Sea sailed at full speed for the Western Pacific , reaching Okinawa on 4 August . During this time , she took command of Carrier Division One . She was the third aircraft carrier to arrive in Korea , as her sister ship Valley Forge as well as HMS Triumph had arrived in July . By the time Philippine Sea arrived in Korea , the UN forces had established superiority in the air and sea . 
 Philippine Sea arrived in Korean waters on 1 August , and became flagship of Task Force 77 on 5 August . She immediately began launching air strikes against strategic targets , as the Battle of Pusan Perimeter began and United Nations and United States Army forces fought a defensive battle against the North Korean Korean People 's Army . Her first strikes were against <unk> , <unk> , and Kunsan . The strikes were at first planned to target North Korean lines of communication but the intensity of the battle at Pusan Perimeter forced the carrier to fly primarily close air support missions for troops on the front lines . They also hit targets of opportunity , such as North Korean boats , bridges and dams spotted during missions . As many as 140 sorties a day were launched from the carrier . Except for brief rests to re @-@ arm , refuel , or repair , Philippine Sea was in action continuously . She was put in a rotation of continuous action with Valley Forge to assure at least one was launching aircraft at all times . Following the beginning of The Great Naktong Offensive on 31 August , the two carriers launched 263 sorties to prevent the North Koreans from overrunning Pusan Perimeter . The ship sent sorties to defend Masan during the Battle of Masan , in spite of being 200 miles ( 320 km ) from the area . The ship steamed to the southern tip of the Peninsula at 27 knots ( 50 km / h ; 31 mph ) on 1 September to support the Masan area more easily during the North Korean attacks . 
 With the other carriers of Task Force 77 , Philippine Sea targeted rail and communication centers around North Korean @-@ controlled Seoul to Wonsan in September . The strikes were part of a deception plan to draw North Korean attention away from the UN force massing for an attack on Inchon . Stationed in the Yellow Sea , she sent numerous air attacks on Inchon and <unk> @-@ do in preparation for Operation Chromite . The day of the operation , 15 September , Philippine Sea dispatched planes far inland to destroy North Korean positions and prevent reinforcements from countering the Inchon landings . Following the initial assault , she continued to provide close air support for the thrust inland to recapture Seoul . During this time , she was joined by Boxer . They were part of a massive invasion force of some 230 ships and hundreds of aircraft .

 On 17 September 1950 a pair of Grumman F9F @-@ 2 Panthers launched from the deck of Philippine Sea . VF @-@ 112 Ensign Edward D. Jackson Jr. was leading a section dispatched to strafe an airfield near North Korea 's capital , Pyongyang . Flying on his wing was Ensign <unk> E. Crow . The airfield turned out to be little more than a grass strip littered with burned and shattered Soviet @-@ built war machines . After strafing a locomotive and setting it ablaze , the jets turned north and started down the Han River . Soon , Jackson spotted about 75 river boats . When they starting receiving small arms fire from " passengers " on the vessels , Crow followed Jackson down as they made a low strafing pass , splintering many of the small craft with 20 mm cannon fire . After the pass both attackers started to climb from 50 feet ( 15 m ) AGL . Jackson then flew through an aerial booby trap : steel cables strung across the Han to " clothesline " low flying planes . The Panther ripped through the cables like twine , but the <unk> cable strands caught the starboard wing , shredded the wingtip tank and snapped across the canopy , punching out the windscreen and side windows . The impact knocked Jackson unconscious with severe facial injuries . Crow , flying just astern noticed something wrong , then saw the crushed wing tank and shattered canopy , its inner surface misted with blood . After 20 seconds Jackson regained consciousness and found himself blinded by shards of Plexiglas and blood . Crow was able to guide his leader towards the Yellow Sea , but Jackson was fading in and out of consciousness . With only the left flap down due to damage to the right wing the Panther approached the ship and with the help of LSO <unk> " Les " <unk> and Crow the blind pilot trapped the # 4 wire on the first attempt . Jackson survived with 36 stitches and an emergency blood transfusion . 
 In November 1950 when China surprised the United Nations ground troops with an unexpected counterattack from the Yalu River by the People 's Liberation Army , Philippine Sea planes saw heavy action . The US Navy had sent Valley Forge and several other ships away from Korea , expecting the conflict to end , and so the unprepared forces remaining in the area were heavily engaged . Throughout the long retreat from the Yalu River , the four carriers ' Panthers , Skyraiders and Corsairs provided close air support for the trapped X Corps at Chosin Reservoir . Though the increasingly cold weather proved a problem for Philippine Sea , the ship continued to support the troops as they tried to evacuate from the reservoir and then cleared the path for their retreat to Hungnam . The carriers provided support with hundreds of aircraft sorties as 150 @,@ 000 UN troops and civilians were evacuated , and then destroyed the port . During this support , Valley Forge and Philippine Sea were tightly clustered with Leyte and Princeton and commanders worried that they would be a target for air attack by North Korean MiG @-@ 15 fighters , prompting a large screen of 32 destroyers . 
 For the rest of 1950 and early 1951 , she launched numerous attacks against Chinese forces around the 38th Parallel hoping to slow their advance as UN troops retreated . With only brief stops for repair and rest , the carrier continued numerous sorties against Chinese targets . On 25 February , command of Task Force 77 was transferred to Valley Forge . During this time , the cold weather hampered operations and blizzards occasionally shut them down completely . Putting into Yokosuka Naval Base , Japan , in late March 1951 for repair and refit , Philippine Sea exchanged Air Group 11 for Carrier Air Group 2 from Valley Forge , a group which consisted mostly of Vought F4U Corsair fighter @-@ bombers . The same date as the transfer on 28 March , Philippine Sea became flagship of Vice Admiral H. M. Martin , the commander of the 7th Fleet . 
 Returning to the Sea of Japan in April , Philippine Sea led Task Force 77 as well as other ships of the 7th Fleet through the Strait of Formosa to the South China Sea . From the Formosa Strait , planes flew in parades over Formosa as part of a show of support for the newly formed nation of Taiwan , in an effort to boost morale of the nation . She steamed back to Korea three days later , in time to lend close air support to UN forces throughout early 1951 as they faced repeated offensives by the Chinese . 
 Philippine Sea completed her first deployment to Korea and arrived at San Francisco on 9 June 1951 . It conducted refits , repairs and patrol operations along the West Coast continued for the remainder of the year . On 19 December , she was the site of a test for an emergency nuclear weapon assembly , the first such test involving a nuclear weapon aboard a US Navy ship . The ship departed from San Diego on 31 December 1951 . Arriving at Pearl Harbor on 8 January 1952 , Philippine Sea continued on to Yokosuka for a second deployment to Korea , arriving 20 January 1952 with Carrier Air Group 11 , which flew five squadrons of the F4U Corsair , about 100 aircraft . During this tour , the front lines in Korea had largely stabilized , and instead the ship directed its aircraft against strategic targets , including the 23 June attack on the Sui @-@ ho Dam in conjunction with Boxer , Princeton , and Bon Homme Richard , and sending aircraft against targets in Pyongyang . 
 Philippine Sea returned to San Diego in August 1952 . Her designation was changed to CVA , denoting an " attack aircraft carrier " in October . With five more Corsair squadrons of Carrier Air Group 9 embarked , she began a third cruise to the Far East early in December 1952 with about 100 aircraft . In this third tour in Korea , Philippine Sea focused primarily on interdiction attacks against rail and communication lines in North Korea , hoping to limit supplies to the front lines . The North Korean offensive , begun at the same time truce talks began at Panmunjom , marked the beginning of a series of " round the clock " air sorties designed to weaken North Korean and Chinese front line troops and support UN troops when under attack . This mission continued until an armistice was signed in the summer of 1953 , resulting in the de jure cessation of open warfare .

 Following the end of her tour in Korea , the ship arrived in Alameda Naval Air Station in Alameda , California on 14 August 1953 to offload Air Group 9 , then entered drydock at Hunters Point in San Francisco for overhaul . On 9 January 1954 , Philippine Sea once more began training off the coast of San Diego . She then steamed west on 12 March , for her fourth tour in the Far East . She operated out of U.S. Naval Base Subic Bay near Olongapo , The Philippines . She was part of Carrier Division 3 and operated alongside Hornet around French Indochina . 
 The most significant event of the tour occurred in late July 1954 . Chinese airplanes had shot down a Douglas DC @-@ 4 passenger aircraft operated by Cathay Pacific Airways near Hainan Island off the Chinese coast . The Chinese military had believed it to be a Taiwanese military airplane . Philippine Sea was ordered into the area as part of a search mission to recover some of the 19 on board . While engaged in the search mission , a flight of the ship 's Douglas AD Skyraiders was attacked by two Chinese fighter aircraft . The Skyraiders returned fire and shot down the airplanes . Later this came to be known unofficially as the " Hainan Incident " . 
 Following this duty , the ship sailed for Hawaii , where she was used as a prop in the movie Mister Roberts . The ship returned to San Diego in November . Remaining in the area for four months , Philippine Sea conducted several training operations off the California coast . She then began her fifth cruise of the Far East on 1 April 1955 en route to Yokosuka . She operated in waters of Japan , Okinawa , and Taiwan for most of 1955 , with Air Task Group 2 consisting of VF @-@ 123 , VF @-@ 143 and VA @-@ 55 , VF @-@ 123 flying the F9F @-@ 2 Panther jet fighter @-@ bomber , VF @-@ 143 flying the Grumman F9F @-@ 6 Cougar jet fighter , and VA @-@ 55 flying the AD @-@ 6 Skyraider propellor attack bomber . During this time , she made trips to Hong Kong , Keelung and Formosa . On 23 November , she was redesignated as a CVS , or an anti @-@ submarine warfare carrier . Her aircraft complement was replaced with several dozen <unk> Tracker anti @-@ submarine aircraft and HSS @-@ 1 <unk> helicopters . She returned to San Diego on 23 November 1955 . Throughout 1956 she saw little activity as crew went on leave and she was docked for upkeep , and only conducted several routine training operations off the coast of southern California . In late 1956 she moved to Hawaii for more training operations . 
 In March 1957 , she sailed for the western Pacific on a sixth tour to the area with the HSS @-@ 1s and <unk> of VS @-@ 21 , VS @-@ 23 , and VS @-@ 37 . She was there for two months before returning to San Diego and resuming training missions off the west coast in summer 1957 . In November 1957 , she found some debris of Pan Am Flight 7 , an airline flight that disappeared en route to Hawaii . In January 1958 , she steamed west on her last 7th Fleet deployment . Remaining six months , she returned to San Diego on 15 July and commenced inactivation . She was decommissioned 28 December 1958 and berthed with the United States Reserve Fleet at Long Beach , California . She was redesignated AVT @-@ 11 , an auxiliary aircraft transport and landing training ship , on 15 May 1959 . After 10 years docked at the reserve fleet , she was struck from the Naval Vessel Registry on 1 December 1969 and sold for scrapping on 23 March 1971 to <unk> Explorations Corporation in Portland , Oregon . 
 Philippine Sea received nine battle stars for Korean War service . During her career , she logged 82 @,@ 000 launches , including 33 @,@ 575 catapult shots , and 82 @,@ 813 landings . In April 1987 , a new USS Philippine Sea ( CG @-@ 58 ) was launched , a Ticonderoga @-@ class guided missile cruiser . An organization was also formed of veterans who had served aboard the ship , the Philippine Sea Association . 
 = Battle of Quebec ( 1775 ) = 
 The Battle of Quebec ( French : Bataille de Québec ) was fought on December 31 , 1775 , between American Continental Army forces and the British defenders of Quebec City early in the American Revolutionary War . The battle was the first major defeat of the war for the Americans , and it came with heavy losses . General Richard Montgomery was killed , Benedict Arnold was wounded , and Daniel Morgan and more than 400 men were taken prisoner . The city 's garrison , a motley assortment of regular troops and militia led by Quebec 's provincial governor , General Guy Carleton , suffered a small number of casualties . 
 Montgomery 's army had captured Montreal on November 13 , and early in December they joined a force led by Arnold , whose men had made an arduous trek through the wilderness of northern New England . Governor Carleton had escaped from Montreal to Quebec , the Americans ' next objective , and last @-@ minute reinforcements arrived to bolster the city 's limited defenses before the attacking force 's arrival . Concerned that expiring enlistments would reduce his force , Montgomery made the end @-@ of @-@ year attack in a blinding snowstorm to conceal his army 's movements . The plan was for separate forces led by Montgomery and Arnold to converge in the lower city before scaling the walls protecting the upper city . Montgomery 's force turned back after he was killed by cannon fire early in the battle , but Arnold 's force penetrated further into the lower city . Arnold was injured early in the attack , and Morgan led the assault in his place before he became trapped in the lower city and was forced to surrender . Arnold and the Americans maintained an ineffectual blockade of the city until spring , when British reinforcements arrived . 
 In the battle and the following siege , French @-@ speaking Canadians were active on both sides of the conflict . The American forces received supplies and logistical support from local residents , and the city 's defenders included locally raised militia . When the Americans retreated , they were accompanied by a number of their supporters ; those who remained behind were subjected to a variety of punishments after the British re @-@ established control over the province . 
 = = Background = = 
 Shortly after the American Revolutionary War broke out in April 1775 , a small enterprising force led by Ethan Allen and Benedict Arnold captured the key fortress at Ticonderoga on May 10 . Arnold followed up the capture with a raid on Fort Saint @-@ Jean not far from Montreal , alarming the British leadership there . These actions stimulated both British and rebel leaders to consider the possibility of an invasion of the Province of Quebec by the rebellious forces of the Second Continental Congress , and Quebec 's governor , General Guy Carleton , began mobilizing the provincial defenses . After first rejecting the idea of an attack on Quebec , the Congress authorized the Continental Army 's commander of its Northern Department , Major General Philip Schuyler , to invade the province if he felt it necessary . As part of an American propaganda offensive , letters from Congress and the New York Provincial Assembly were circulated throughout the province , promising liberation from their oppressive government . Benedict Arnold , passed over for command of the expedition , convinced General George Washington to authorize a second expedition through the wilderness of what is now the state of Maine directly to Quebec City , capital of the province . 
 The Continental Army began moving into Quebec in September 1775 . Its goal , as stated in a proclamation by General Schuyler , was to " drive away , if possible , the troops of Great Britain " that " under the orders of a despotic ministry ... aim to subject their fellow @-@ citizens and brethren to the yoke of a hard slavery . " Brigadier General Richard Montgomery led the force from Ticonderoga and Crown Point up Lake Champlain , successfully besieging Fort St. Jean , and capturing Montreal on November 13 . Arnold led a force of 1 @,@ 100 men from Cambridge , Massachusetts on the expedition through Maine towards Quebec shortly after Montgomery 's departure from Ticonderoga . 
 One significant expectation of the American advance into Quebec was that the large French Catholic Canadian population of the province and city would rise against British rule . Since the British took control of the province , during the French and Indian War in 1760 , there had been difficulties and disagreements between the local French Catholics and the Protestant English @-@ speaking British military and civilian administrations . However , these tensions had been eased by the passage of the Quebec Act of 1774 , which restored land and many civil rights to the Canadians ( an act which had been condemned by the thirteen rebelling colonies ) . The majority of Quebec 's French inhabitants chose not to play an active role in the American campaign , in large part because , encouraged by their clergy , they had come to accept British rule with its backing of the Catholic Church and preservation of French culture . 
 = = British preparations = = 
 = = = Defense of the province = = = 
 General Carleton had begun preparing the province 's defenses immediately on learning of Arnold 's raid on St. Jean . Although Carleton concentrated most of his modest force at Fort St. Jean , he left small garrisons of British regular army troops at Montreal and Quebec . Carleton followed the American invasion 's progress , occasionally receiving intercepted communications between Montgomery and Arnold . Lieutenant Governor Hector Cramahé , in charge of Quebec 's defenses while Carleton was in Montreal , organized a militia force of several hundred to defend the town in September . He pessimistically thought they were " not much to be depended on " , estimating that only half were reliable . Cramahé also made numerous requests for military reinforcements to the military leadership in Boston , but each of these came to nought . Several troop ships were blown off course and ended up in New York , and Vice Admiral Samuel Graves , the commander of the fleet in Boston , refused to release ships to transport troops from there to Quebec because the approaching winter would close the Saint Lawrence River . 
 When definitive word reached Quebec on November 3 that Arnold 's march had succeeded and that he was approaching the city , Cramahé began tightening the guard and had all boats removed from the south shore of the Saint Lawrence . Word of Arnold 's approach resulted in further militia enlistments , increasing the ranks to 1 @,@ 200 or more . Two ships arrived on November 3 , followed by a third the next day , carrying militia volunteers from St. John 's Island and Newfoundland that added about 120 men to the defense . A small convoy under the command of the frigate HMS Lizard also arrived that day , from which a number of marines were added to the town 's defenses . 
 On November 10 , Lieutenant Colonel Allen Maclean , who had been involved in an attempt to lift the siege at St. Jean , arrived with 200 men of his Royal Highland Emigrants . They had intercepted communications from Arnold to Montgomery near Trois @-@ Rivières , and hurried to Quebec to help with its defense . The arrival of this experienced force boosted the morale of the town militia , and Maclean immediately took charge of the defenses . 
 = = = Carleton arrives at Quebec = = = 
 In the wake of the fall of Fort St. Jean , Carleton abandoned Montreal and returned to Quebec City by ship , narrowly escaping capture . Upon his arrival on November 19 , he immediately took command . Three days later , he issued a proclamation that any able @-@ bodied man in the town who did not take up arms would be assumed to be a rebel or a spy , and would be treated as such . Men not taking up arms were given four days to leave . As a result , about 500 inhabitants ( including 200 British and 300 Canadians ) joined the defense . 
 Carleton addressed the weak points of the town 's defensive fortifications : he had two log barricades and palisades erected along the Saint Lawrence shoreline , within the area covered by his cannons ; he assigned his forces to defensive positions along the walls and the inner defenses ; and he made sure his inexperienced militia were under strong leadership . 
 = = Arnold 's arrival = = 
 The men Arnold chose for his expedition were volunteers drawn from New England companies serving in the Siege of Boston . They were formed into two battalions for the expedition ; a third battalion was composed of riflemen from Pennsylvania and Virginia under Lieutenant Colonel Daniel Morgan 's command . The trek through the wilderness of Maine was long and difficult . The conditions were wet and cold , and the journey took much longer than either Arnold or Washington had expected . Bad weather and wrecked boats spoiled much of the expedition 's food stores , and about 500 men of the original 1 @,@ 100 turned back or died . Those who turned back , including one of the New England battalions , took many of the remaining provisions with them . The men who continued on were starving by the time they reached the first French settlements in early November . On November 9 , the 600 survivors of Arnold 's march from Boston to Quebec arrived at Point Levis , on the south shore of the Saint Lawrence opposite Quebec City . Despite the condition of his troops , Arnold immediately began to gather boats to make a crossing . He was prepared to do so on the night of November 10 , but a storm delayed him for three days . Once on the other side of the Saint Lawrence , Arnold moved his troops onto the Plains of Abraham , about 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 km ) from the city walls . 
 The troops approaching Quebec 's walls were significantly under @-@ equipped . Arnold had no artillery , each of his men carried only five cartridges , more than 100 muskets were unserviceable , and the men 's clothing had been reduced to rags . Despite being outnumbered two to one , Arnold demanded the city 's surrender . Both envoys sent were shot at by British cannons , signifying that the demand had been rebuked . Arnold concluded that he could not take the city by force , so he blockaded the city on its west side . On November 18 , the Americans heard a ( false ) rumour that the British were planning to attack them with 800 men . At a council of war , they decided that the blockade could not be maintained , and Arnold began to move his men 20 miles ( 32 km ) upriver to Pointe @-@ aux @-@ Trembles ( " Aspen Point " ) to wait for Montgomery , who had just taken Montreal . Henry Dearborn , who later became U.S. Secretary of War under President Thomas Jefferson was present at the battle and wrote his famous journal , The Quebec Expedition , which outlined the long and difficult march to the battle and the events that occurred there . 
 = = Montgomery 's arrival = = 
 On December 1 , Montgomery arrived at Pointe @-@ aux @-@ Trembles . His force consisted of 300 men from the 1st , 2nd , and 3rd New York regiments , a company of artillery raised by John Lamb , about 200 men recruited by James Livingston for the 1st Canadian Regiment , and another 160 men led by Jacob Brown who were remnants of regiments disbanded due to expiring enlistments . These were supplemented several days later by a few companies detached by Major General David Wooster , whom Montgomery had left in command at Montreal . The artillery Montgomery brought included four cannons and six mortars , and he also brought winter clothing and other supplies for Arnold 's men ; the clothing and supplies were a prize taken when most of the British ships fleeing Montreal were captured . The commanders quickly turned towards Quebec , and put the city under siege on December 6 . Montgomery sent a personal letter to Carleton demanding the city 's surrender , employing a woman as the messenger . Carleton declined the request and burned the letter unread . Montgomery tried again ten days later , with the same result . The besiegers continued to send messages , primarily intended for the populace in the city , describing the situation there as hopeless , and suggesting that conditions would improve if they rose to assist the Americans . 
 On December 10 , the Americans set up their largest battery of artillery 700 yards ( 640 m ) from the walls . The frozen ground prevented the Americans from entrenching the artillery , so they fashioned a wall out of snow blocks . This battery was used to fire on the city , but the damage it did was of little consequence . Montgomery realized he was in a very difficult position , because the frozen ground prevented the digging of trenches , and his lack of heavy weapons made it impossible to breach the city 's defenses . The enlistments of Arnold 's men were expiring at the end of the year , and no ammunition was on the way from the colonies . Furthermore , it was very likely that British reinforcements would arrive in the spring , meaning he would either have to act or withdraw . Montgomery believed his only chance to take the city was during a snowstorm at night , when his men could scale the walls undetected . 
 While Montgomery planned the attack on the city , Christophe Pélissier , a Frenchman living near Trois @-@ Rivières , came to see him . Pélissier was a political supporter of the American cause who operated the St. Maurice Ironworks . He and Montgomery discussed the idea of holding a provincial convention to elect representatives to Congress . Pélissier recommended against this until after Quebec City had been taken , as the habitants would not feel free to act in that way until their security was better assured . The two agreed that Pélissier 's ironworks would provide munitions ( ammunition , cannonballs , and the like ) for the siege . This Pélissier did until the Americans retreated in May 1776 , at which time he also fled , eventually returning to France . 
 A snowstorm arrived on the night of December 27 , prompting Montgomery to prepare the troops for the attack . However , the storm subsided , and Montgomery called off the assault . That night , a sergeant from Rhode Island deserted , carrying the plan of attack to the British . Montgomery consequently drafted a new plan ; this one called for two feints against Quebec 's western walls , to be led by Jacob Brown and James Livingston , while two attacks would be mounted against the lower town . Arnold would lead one attack to smash through the defenses at the north end of the lower town , and Montgomery would follow along the Saint Lawrence south of the town . The two forces would meet in the lower town and then launch a combined assault on the upper town by scaling its walls . The new plan was revealed only to the senior officers .

 = = = Montgomery 's attack = = = 
 A storm broke out on December 30 , and Montgomery once again gave orders for the attack . Brown and Livingston led their militia companies to their assigned positions that night : Brown by the Cape Diamond bastion , and Livingston outside St. John 's Gate . When Brown reached his position between 4 am and 5 am , he fired flares to signal the other forces , and his men and Livingston 's began to fire on their respective targets . Montgomery and Arnold , seeing the flares , set off for the lower town . 
 Montgomery led his men down the steep , snow @-@ heaped path towards the outer defenses . The storm had turned into a blizzard , making the advance a struggle . Montgomery 's men eventually arrived at the palisade of the outer defenses , where an advance party of carpenters sawed their way though the wall . Montgomery himself helped saw through the second palisade , and led 50 men down a street towards a two @-@ story building . The building formed part of the city 's defenses , and was in fact a blockhouse occupied by 15 Quebec militia armed with muskets and cannons . The defenders opened fire at close range , and Montgomery was killed instantly , shot through the head by a burst of grapeshot . The few men of the advance party who survived fled back towards the palisade ; only Aaron Burr and a few others escaped unhurt . Many of Montgomery 's officers were injured in the attack ; one of the few remaining uninjured officers led the survivors back to the Plains of Abraham , leaving Montgomery 's body behind . 
 = = = Arnold 's attack = = = 
 While Montgomery was making his advance , Arnold advanced with his main body towards the barricades of the Sault @-@ au @-@ <unk> at the northern end of the lower town . They passed the outer gates and some British gun batteries undetected . However , as the advance party moved around the Palace Gate , heavy fire broke out from the city walls above them . The height of the walls made it impossible to return the defenders ' fire , therefore Arnold ordered his men to run forward . They advanced down a narrow street , where they once again came under fire as they approached a barricade . Arnold received a shot in the ankle as he was organizing his men in an attempt to take the barricade and was carried to the rear , after transferring command of his detachment to Daniel Morgan . Under Morgan 's command , they captured the barricade , but had difficulty advancing further because of the narrow twisting streets and damp gunpowder , which prevented their muskets from firing . Morgan and his men holed up in some buildings to dry out their powder and rearm , but they eventually came under increasing fire ; Carleton had realized the attacks on the northern gates were feints and began concentrating his forces in the lower town . A British force of 500 sallied from the Palace Gate and reoccupied the first barricade , trapping Morgan and his men in the city . With no avenue of retreat and under heavy fire , Morgan and his men surrendered . The battle was over by 10 am . 
 This was the first defeat suffered by the Continental Army . Carleton reported 30 Americans killed and 431 taken prisoner , including about two @-@ thirds of Arnold 's force . He also wrote that " many perished on the River " attempting to get away . Allan Maclean reported that 20 bodies were recovered in the spring thaw the following May . Arnold reported about 400 missing or captured , and his official report to Congress claimed 60 killed and 300 captured . British casualties were comparatively light . Carleton 's initial report to General William Howe mentioned only five killed or wounded , but other witness reports ranged as high as 50 . Carleton 's official report listed five killed and 14 wounded . 
 General Montgomery 's body was recovered by the British on New Year 's Day 1776 and was given a simple military funeral on January 4 , paid for by Lieutenant Governor Cramahé . The body was returned to New York in 1818 . 
 = = Siege = = 
 Arnold refused to retreat ; despite being outnumbered three to one , the sub @-@ freezing temperature of the winter and the mass departure of his men after their enlistments expired , he laid siege to Quebec . The siege had relatively little effect on the city , which Carleton claimed had enough supplies stockpiled to last until May . Immediately after the battle , Arnold sent Moses Hazen and Edward Antill to Montreal , where they informed General Wooster of the defeat . They then travelled on to Philadelphia to report the defeat to Congress and request support . ( Both Hazen and Antill , English @-@ speakers originally from the Thirteen Colonies who had settled in Quebec , went on to serve in the Continental Army for the rest of the war . ) In response to their report , Congress ordered reinforcements to be raised and sent north . During the winter months , small companies of men from hastily recruited regiments in New Hampshire , Massachusetts , and Connecticut made their way north to supplement the Continental garrisons at Quebec and Montreal . The presence of disease in the camp outside Quebec , especially smallpox , took a significant toll on the besiegers , as did a general lack of provisions . Smallpox ravaged Montgomery and Arnold 's forces largely due to exposure to infected civilians released from Quebec . Governor Carleton condoned this practice , realizing it would severely weaken the American siege effort . In early April , Arnold was replaced by General Wooster , who was himself replaced in late April by General John Thomas . 
 Governor Carleton , despite appearing to have a significant advantage in manpower , chose not to attack the American camp , and remained within Quebec 's walls . Montgomery , in analysing the situation before the battle , had observed that Carleton served under James Wolfe during the 1759 Siege of Quebec , and knew that the French General Louis @-@ Joseph de Montcalm had paid a heavy price for leaving the city 's defenses , ultimately losing the city and his life in the Battle of the Plains of Abraham . British General James Murray had also lost a battle outside the city in 1760 ; Montgomery judged that Carleton was unlikely to repeat their mistakes . On March 14 , Jean @-@ Baptiste Chasseur , a miller from the southern shore of the Saint Lawrence , reached Quebec City and informed Carleton there were 200 men on the south side of the river ready to act against the Americans . These men and more were mobilized to make an attack on an American gun battery at Point Levis , but an advance guard of this Loyalist militia was defeated in the March 1776 Battle of Saint @-@ Pierre by a detachment of pro @-@ American local militia . 
 When General Thomas arrived , the conditions in the camp led him to conclude that the siege was impossible to maintain , and he began preparing to retreat . The arrival on May 6 of a small British fleet carrying 200 regulars ( the vanguard of a much larger invasion force ) , accelerated the American preparations to depart . The retreat was turned into a near rout when Carleton marched these fresh forces , along with most of his existing garrison , out of the city to face the disorganized Americans . The American forces , ravaged by smallpox ( which claimed General Thomas during the retreat ) , eventually retreated all the way back to Fort Ticonderoga . Carleton then launched a counteroffensive to regain the forts on Lake Champlain . Although he defeated the American fleet in the Battle of Valcour Island and regained control of the lake , the rear guard defense managed by Benedict Arnold prevented further action to capture Ticonderoga or Crown Point in 1776 . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 On May 22 , even before the Americans had been completely driven from the province , Carleton ordered a survey to identify the Canadians who had helped the American expedition in and around Quebec City . François Baby , Gabriel @-@ <unk> <unk> , and Jenkin Williams travelled the province and counted the Canadians who actively provided such help ; they determined that 757 had done so . Carleton was somewhat lenient with minor offenders , and even freed a number of more serious offenders on the promise of good behavior ; however , once the Americans had been driven from the province , measures against supporters of the American cause became harsher , with forced labor to repair American destruction of infrastructure during the army 's retreat being a frequent punishment . These measures had the effect of minimizing the public expression of support for the Americans for the rest of the war . 
 Between May 6 and June 1 , 1776 , nearly 40 British ships arrived at Quebec City . They carried more than 9 @,@ 000 soldiers under the command of General John Burgoyne , including about 4 @,@ 000 German soldiers ; so @-@ called Hessians from Brunswick and Hanau under the command of Baron Friedrich Adolf Riedesel . These forces , some of which having participated in Carleton 's counteroffensive , spent the winter of 1776 – 77 in the province , putting a significant strain on the population , which numbered only about 80 @,@ 000 . Many of these troops were deployed in 1777 for Burgoyne 's campaign for the Hudson Valley . 
 Three current United States Army National Guard units ( Company A of the 69th Infantry Regiment , the 181st Infantry Regiment , and the 182nd Infantry ) trace their lineage to American units that participated in the Battle of Quebec . 
 = Carpenter House ( Norwich , Connecticut ) = 
 The Carpenter House , also known as the Gardiner ( Gardner ) Carpenter House and the Red House , is a Georgian style house in Norwichtown area of Norwich , Connecticut . A house was previously on the site , but it was removed by Gardner Carpenter to construct the house in 1793 . The three @-@ story Flemish bond Georgian house 's front facade consists of five bays with a gabled porch over the main entrance and supported by round columns . The gambrel roof and third story addition were added around 1816 by Joseph Huntington . In 1958 , a modern one @-@ story rear wing was added to the back of the house . The interior of the house is a center hall plan with 10 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) high ceilings and has been renovated , but retains much of its original molding , paneling and wrought iron hardware . It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1970 and added to the Norwichtown Historic District in 1973 . 
 = = History = = 
 Historical records for Gardner Carpenter 's life are sparse in detail , but the Vital records of Norwich , 1659 @-@ 1848 Part II provide some information . Gardner Carpenter married Mary Huntington , daughter of Benjamin Huntington Jr . , on October 29 , 1791 . Carpenter was a local business man who operated his mercantile business in a shop that was shared with his brother , Joseph Carpenter , the silversmith . The Carpenters ' shared shop is historically significant and is known as the Joseph Carpenter Silversmith Shop . A 1906 paper titled Norwich : early homes and history identified Gardner Carpenter as the builder of the store and noted that Gardner Carpenter was one of the first traders of Norwich . In 1793 , the house which is now known as the Carpenter House was constructed on the property after a previous house on the land was removed . Gardner and Mary Carpenter would have six children together ; their first son , George , was born in 1795 and their first and only daughter , Mary Elizabeth , in 1797 . Another son , Gardner Carpenter , was born in 1802 and was followed by Henry in 1804 , John in 1807 and Charles in 1810 . Gardiner Carpenter served as a pay master in the 17th Connecticut Regiment in the American Revolutionary War and he was the postmaster of Norwich from 1799 to 1814 , shortly before his death in 1815 . His wife , Mary Carpenter , died in 1838 . The house was sold to Joseph Huntington after Carpenter 's death , who would add a third story around 1816 . The house was sold again to Reverend Hiram P. Arms in 1841 .

 The Georgian house is built on the north end of the Norwichtown green and faces East Town Street . The walls of the three @-@ story house are made of brick laid in Flemish bond and painted a cranberry red . The front facade consist of five bays with a gabled porch over the main entrance and supported by round columns . The doorway is not original , but has a transom of six lights on top . The windows of the house are double hung six @-@ over @-@ six sash with the windows on the first floor have flat splayed lintels mimicking the gabled porch . The third story is also the attack and has an oversized gambrel roof that over hangs the two stories , the roof was covered with asphalt shingles at the time of its nomination in 1970 . This addition of the third story was done about 1816 when the house was owned by Joseph Huntington . A modern one @-@ story rear wing is at the back of the house , the last addition dating to 1958 . Four chimneys arise from the roof of the house , with two interior chimneys and a rear chimney on the main house with a smaller fourth chimney on the one @-@ story rear addition . The interior of the house is a typical center hall plan which retains much of its original moldings , paneling and wrought iron hardware . The 1958 addition added a 16 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) by 26 @-@ foot ( 7 @.@ 9 m ) family room . 
 The interior of the house comprises 3 @,@ 200 square feet ( 300 m2 ) and was renovated sometime after its addition to the National Register of Historic Places in 1970 . Circa 1980 , the home was purchased by the <unk> family and underwent a historical restoration . The <unk> ' restoration included removing the wallpaper , applying historic paint colors and stripping and refinishing the original floor 's wooden planks . The renovations also included using wood shingles to preserve the authenticity of the house . The interior consists of 11 rooms and includes 10 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) high ceilings . Four rooms are on the second floor , including a 15 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) by 16 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) master bedroom . The house has a total of six known fireplaces with another two likely concealed under plaster . The floors were restored and some planks had to be replaced in the process .

 The house was added to the National Register of Historic Places on October 6 , 1970 . It was made a part of the Norwichtown Historic District on January 17 , 1973 , but was unaccredited as a separately listed property at the time . On the district nomination the house is spelled alternatively as the " Gardner House " . Luyster writes , " This is a good example of Georgian housing of the colonial period . Its value is increased because of the historical and architectural value of the buildings which surround it since it is located next to the Norwich town green which is the focal point of the historic district in that area . " The home was featured as part of a historic house tour in 1993 's " More Reflections on the Past . " In 2002 , the house was available for purchase and remains a private residence as of 2014 . 
 = Deep Space Homer = 
 " Deep Space Homer " is the fifteenth episode of The Simpsons ' fifth season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on February 24 , 1994 . It was directed by Carlos Baeza and was the only episode of The Simpsons written by David Mirkin , who was also the executive producer at the time . In the episode , NASA is concerned by the decline in public interest in space exploration , and therefore decides to send an ordinary person into space . Homer is selected and chaos ensues when the navigation system on his space shuttle is destroyed . Buzz Aldrin and James Taylor both guest starred as themselves . The critically acclaimed episode became the source of the Overlord meme , and features numerous film parodies , mostly of The Right Stuff and 2001 : A Space Odyssey . A copy of the episode is available for astronauts to watch at the International Space Station . 
 = = Plot = = 
 At the Springfield Nuclear Power Plant , it is time for the ceremony for the " Worker of the Week " award and Homer , the only employee who has never won the award , is confident he will win . However , Mr. Burns gives the award to an ' inanimate carbon rod ' . The dejected Homer , feeling that no one respects him , turns to TV for solace and comes across a live space shuttle launch , which he finds dull . Meanwhile , NASA , frustrated over its drop in the Nielsen ratings , decides to send an " average <unk> " into space as the solution . At that moment , Homer telephones NASA to complain about their " boring space launches " , as well as asking if they know where he can find some Tang , and NASA chiefs realize they have found their man . When they arrive at Moe 's Tavern in search of Homer , who is currently calling Bill Clinton to ask about Tang , he believes he is in trouble for making a prank call to NASA and blames Barney for the incident . The NASA employees ask Barney to be an astronaut , and when Homer realizes what the proposal entails , he steps in and takes credit for the call . 
 NASA takes both Homer and Barney to Cape Canaveral for training . As only one of them can go into space , they soon find themselves in competition . Under NASA 's alcohol ban , the newly sober Barney quickly develops superior skills and is selected to fly with astronauts Buzz Aldrin and Race <unk> . However , when Barney toasts his victory with non @-@ alcoholic champagne , he inexplicably reverts to his normal alcoholic self and escapes , stealing a jetpack and crashing into a nearby pillow factory . Homer wins by default and is selected for space flight , but after watching an episode of Itchy and Scratchy involving space exploration , he becomes very nervous about going . Just as they prepare to take off in the <unk> space shuttle , Homer runs away . He talks with Marge on the phone , and she says that he ought to take advantage of the opportunity . He agrees , and the launch , which is also a Nielsen ratings smash , proceeds . 
 Finally in space , Homer reveals he has smuggled potato chips on board . He opens the bag , but is unaware that , due to the effects of weightlessness , they will spread around and clog the instruments . His appetite seems to save the day as he floats after the chips , eating them , but he manages to fly into an experimental ant farm , letting the ants loose in the shuttle . James Taylor comes in over the radio to sing " You 've Got a Friend " , but the disaster continues on board as the ants destroy the navigation system . James Taylor suggests that they blow the bugs out the front hatch , which the astronauts do , but Homer fails to put on his harness and is nearly blown out of the open hatch before grabbing its handle and clinging for life . Buzz pulls him inside , but due to the vacuum 's sheer force , Homer bends the hatch handle , preventing the door from closing and potentially resulting in the shuttle 's destruction on re @-@ entry . When Race declares he will attack Homer in frustration , Homer pulls a rod out of the wall to defend himself , and he inadvertently uses it to seal the door shut . With the problems solved , the shuttle successfully returns to Earth , making a convenient crash @-@ landing through the roof of a press reporters ' convention . 
 Although Buzz Aldrin declares Homer a hero , the press only have eyes for the inanimate carbon rod he used . The rod is featured on magazine covers with the headline " In Rod We Trust " and is given its own ticker @-@ tape parade . Back at home , Homer is disappointed that he did not get as much respect as he had hoped , but the family still honors him for his achievement . 
 = = Production = = 
 " Deep Space Homer " was written by then @-@ executive producer David Mirkin . Mirkin had worked on the idea for the episode for a long time , basing the story on NASA 's Teacher in Space Project scheme to send ordinary civilians into space in order to spark interest amongst the general public . There was some controversy amongst the show 's writing staff during production . Some of the writers felt that having Homer go into space was too large an idea . Matt Groening felt that the idea was so big that it gave the writers " nowhere to go " . Several silly gags were therefore toned down to make the episode feel more realistic , including an idea that everyone at NASA was as stupid as Homer . The writers focused more upon the relationship between Homer and his family and Homer 's attempts to be a hero . 
 Buzz Aldrin , the second man to walk on the Moon , and musician James Taylor both guest star as themselves in this episode . Some of the writers were concerned about Aldrin 's line , " second comes right after first " , feeling it was insulting to Aldrin . An alternative line was written : " first to take a soil sample " , but Aldrin had no problem with saying the original line . A version of James Taylor 's " Fire and Rain " was recorded specifically for the episode containing some altered lyrics . Taylor 's original recording session was included as an extra on the DVD . 
 Although the episode was directed by Carlos Baeza , the potato chip sequence was directed by David Silverman . Some computer animation created using an Amiga was used in the sequence in order to make the potato chip rotation as smooth as possible . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The two blue collar TV shows the people at NASA watch are Home Improvement and Married ... with Children . In the scene where the family arrives at Cape Canaveral , the car is a parody of The Beverly Hillbillies , with Marge sitting in Granny 's position . Homer and Barney 's duel is a reference to the classic Star Trek episode " The Gamesters of Triskelion " , complete with one of Star Trek 's fight themes ( originally from the episode " Amok Time " ) and the NASA administrators betting on the combatants in " <unk> " . Homer running while lying on the floor and trying to read the back of his head is a homage to the Three Stooges , particularly Curly . The TV anchor is a parody of Tom Brokaw , and is voiced by Harry Shearer . A lot of words containing the letter L were intentionally written into the dialogue because the writers " enjoy the way Tom says them " . Astronaut Race <unk> is a parody of Jonny Quest character Race Bannon . 
 The music at the start of the episode of the Itchy & Scratchy cartoon parodies the theme from the original Star Trek series . Itchy bursts out of Scratchy 's stomach in a parody of the creature from the Alien films . Homer hopes that his crew will not be sent to " that terrible Planet of the Apes " , only to suddenly figure out the film 's ending ; he then unwittingly performs Charlton Heston 's final scene in the film . Much of the episode parodies The Right Stuff , with sequences such as Barney and Homer 's training , Homer 's walk to the shuttle and the shuttle 's re @-@ entry paying homage to the film . Barney sings the first part of the Major @-@ General 's Song from Gilbert and Sullivan 's The Pirates of Penzance while doing flips to show how fit he is , while Homer responds with cartwheels , reciting " There once was a man from Nantucket ... " . 
 The episode also contains numerous other references to Stanley Kubrick 's 1968 film 2001 : A Space Odyssey : in the space shuttle , Homer floats in zero gravity , eating potato chips ( this echoes the docking scene in 2001 , with the use of the music piece The Blue Danube ) ; Itchy comes out to torture Scratchy in an EVA pod much like those aboard the Discovery craft ; and at the end of the episode , Bart throws a marker into the air - in slow motion , it rotates in mid @-@ air , before a match cut replaces it with a cylindrical satellite ( this parodies a similar transition scene between " The Dawn of Man " and the future sequence in the film , including the use of the famous Richard Strauss piece Also sprach Zarathustra ) .

 In its original broadcast , " Deep Space Homer " finished 32nd in ratings for the week of February 21 – 27 , 1994 , with a Nielsen rating of 11 @.@ 1 , equivalent to approximately 10 @.@ 3 million viewing households . It was the highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network that week , beating Living Single . 
 NASA loved the episode , and astronaut Edward Lu asked for a copy of it to be sent on a supply ship to the International Space Station . The DVD remains there for astronauts to view . " Deep Space Homer " is MSNBC 's fourth favorite episode , citing Homer 's realization that Planet of the Apes is set on Earth as " pure genius " . Empire magazine named it a " contender for greatest ever episode " , and listed it as the third best movie parody in the show . In his book , Planet Simpson , Chris Turner names the episode as being one of his five favorites , saying it is " second to none " , despite listing " Last Exit to Springfield " as his favorite episode . He described the long sequence that begins with Homer eating potato chips in the space shuttle and ends with Kent Brockman 's dramatic speech as being " simply among the finest comedic moments in the history of television " . The Daily Telegraph also named the episode among their ten favorites . 
 Both Buzz Aldrin and James Taylor received praise for their guest performances . IGN ranked James Taylor as being the twenty @-@ first best guest appearance in the show 's history . The Phoenix.com published their own list of " Top 20 guest stars " and Taylor placed eighteenth . Among The Simpsons staff , the episode is a favorite of David Silverman . On the other hand , it also contains one of Matt Groening 's least favorite jokes , when Homer 's face changes into Popeye and Richard Nixon while exposed to G @-@ force . 
 " Deep Space Homer " is the source of the " Overlord meme " , which is lifted from Kent Brockman 's line and is commonly used on Internet forums to express mock submission , usually for the purpose of humor or when a " participant vastly overstates the degree of oppression or social control expected to arise from the topic in question " . The term was used by New Scientist magazine , and was referenced on the February 16 , 2011 episode of Jeopardy ! by Ken Jennings in acknowledgment of the accomplishments of the computer Watson . 
 In 2014 , 20 years after the production of this episode , NASA did indeed send ants to the International Space Station to conduct behavioral experiments about collective search in microgravity . The results of this experiment were published in the journal Frontiers in Ecology and Evolution . 
 = Typhoon Rusa = 
 Typhoon Rusa was the most powerful typhoon to strike South Korea in 43 years . It was the 21st JTWC tropical depression , the 15th named storm , and the 10th typhoon of the 2002 Pacific typhoon season . It developed on August 22 from the monsoon trough in the northwestern Pacific Ocean , well to the southeast of Japan . For several days , Rusa moved to the northwest , eventually intensifying into a powerful typhoon . On August 26 , the storm moved across the Amami Islands of Japan , where Rusa left 20 @,@ 000 people without power and caused two fatalities . Across Japan , the typhoon dropped torrential rainfall peaking at 902 mm ( 35 @.@ 5 in ) in Tokushima Prefecture . 
 After weakening slightly , Rusa made landfall on Goheung , South Korea with winds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph 10 minute sustained ) . It was able to maintain much of its intensity due to warm air and instability from a nearby cold front . Rusa weakened while moving through the country , dropping heavy rainfall that peaked at 897 @.@ 5 mm ( 35 @.@ 33 in ) in Gangneung . A 24 @-@ hour total of 880 mm ( 35 in ) in the city broke the record for the highest daily precipitation in the country ; however , the heaviest rainfall was localized . Over 17 @,@ 000 houses were damaged , and large areas of crop fields were flooded . In South Korea , Rusa killed at least 233 people , making it the deadliest typhoon there in over 43 years , and caused $ 4 @.@ 2 billion in damage . The typhoon also dropped heavy rainfall in neighboring North Korea , leaving 26 @,@ 000 people homeless and killing three . Rusa also destroyed large areas of crops in the country already affected by ongoing famine conditions . The typhoon later became extratropical over eastern Russia on September 1 , dissipating three days later .

 The monsoon trough spawned a tropical depression on August 22 north of Bikini Atoll and southwest of Wake Island . It moved to the west @-@ northwest , a movement it would maintain for much of its duration . Early on August 23 , it intensified into Tropical Storm Rusa , about 1 @,@ 800 km ( 1 @,@ 100 mi ) east of Guam . At 1800 UTC on August 25 , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) upgraded Rusa to a typhoon while the system was northeast of the Northern Marianas Islands . The next day , the agency estimated that the typhoon attained peak winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph 10 minute sustained ) . Around the same time , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) estimated peak winds of 215 km / h ( 135 mph 1 minute sustained ) . 
 While at peak intensity , Rusa struck the Japanese island of Amami Ōshima . After maintaining the peak winds for about 12 hours , Rusa weakened slightly as it continued to the west @-@ northwest , but on August 28 the JMA again reported the typhoon attained winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph 10 minute sustained ) . Despite forecasts that it would weaken , Rusa maintained its intensity while passing south of Japan , due to minimal wind shear and warm sea surface temperatures of up to 29 ° C ( 84 ° F ) . The typhoon again weakened slightly on August 29 while passing between the Amami Islands and Japan . Thereafter , Rusa turned to the north toward the Korean Peninsula . Warm , moist air blew across the peninsula ahead of the storm , which prevented significant weakening , and an approaching cold front contributed to atmospheric instability . At around 0800 UTC on August 31 , Rusa made landfall on Goheung , South Korea , with winds of 140 km / h ( 85 mph 10 minute sustained ) . According to the JTWC , Rusa was the most powerful typhoon to hit the country since 1959 . The typhoon rapidly weakened while crossing the country , deteriorating into a tropical depression early on September 1 . Around that time , the JTWC issued its last advisory on the system . The depression turned to the northeast , and after moving through the Sea of Japan , Rusa became extratropical over Primorsky Krai in the Russian Far East late on September 1 . The extratropical remnants continued northeast and dissipated on September 4 over the Kamchatka Peninsula .

 = Francis Bok = 
 Francis <unk> Bol Bok ( born February 1979 ) , a Dinka tribesman and native of South Sudan , was a slave for ten years but is now an abolitionist and author living in the United States . On May 15 , 1986 , he was captured and enslaved at the age of seven during an Arab militia raid on the village of <unk> in South Sudan during the Second Sudanese Civil War . Bok lived in bondage for ten years before escaping imprisonment in <unk> , Sudan , followed by a journey to the United States by way of Cairo , Egypt . 
 Bok was aided by people of diverse cultures and faiths in his journey to freedom . His earliest steps towards the United States were helped by a Northern Sudanese Muslim family that believed that slavery was wrong and provided him a bus ticket to Khartoum . Upon arriving in Khartoum , Bok was aided by a fellow Dinka tribesman and members of the Fur people , and his trip to the United States was paid for by members of the Lutheran church . His first point of contact in the United States was a refugee from Somalia who helped him get settled in Fargo , North Dakota . 
 Bok has testified before the United States Senate and met with George W. Bush , Madeleine Albright and Condoleezza Rice , telling them his story of slavery . He has been honored by the United States Olympic Committee , the Boston Celtics and colleges and universities throughout the United States and Canada . Francis now lives in the U.S. state of Kansas , where he works for the American Anti @-@ Slavery Group ( AASG ) and Sudan Sunrise , an organization that works for peace in Sudan . Bok 's autobiography , Escape from Slavery : The True Story of My Ten Years in Captivity and My Journey to Freedom in America , published by St. Martin 's Press , chronicles his life , from his early youth , his years in captivity , to his work in the United States as an abolitionist . 
 = = Childhood and abduction = = 
 Francis Bok was raised in a large Catholic family of cattle herders in the Dinka village of Gurion in Southern Sudan . His father , Bol Buk Dol , managed several herds of cattle , sheep and goats . When Bok was captured at the age of 7 on May 15 , 1986 , he could not count beyond 10 and knew very little of the outside world . 
 Bok was captured after his mother , <unk> Al <unk> , had sent him to the village of <unk> to sell eggs and peanuts in the village market with some older siblings and neighbors . This was Bok 's first trip to the village without his mother , and it was the first time he was allowed to sell some of the family 's goods at the market . 
 Bok went to the market , where he heard adults say that they had seen smoke coming from nearby villages and had heard gunfire in the distance . People began fleeing the market as Francis saw horsemen with machine guns . The gunmen surrounded the market and shot the men in <unk> . The raiders were part of an Islamic militia from the northern part of Sudan that conducted periodic raids on the villages of their Dinka neighbors , who were Christians or animists of Sub @-@ Saharan African descent . 
 = = Life as a slave = = 
 Seven @-@ year @-@ old Bok was captured by Giemma , a member of the slave hunting militia , who forced him to join a caravan of slaves , stolen produce , livestock and wares that the militia had captured in their raid of the Dinka settlement . When the members of the militia split up to return to their homes , Bok was taken by Giemma . Upon arriving at Giemma 's residence , Francis was beaten by his captor 's children with sticks and was called <unk> . The word literally means " slave " and the stereotype is that of an inferior , demeaned , Negroid race . Francis was given quarters in a hovel near the pens of Giemma 's livestock . 
 Bok began a ten @-@ year period of slavery at the hands of Giemma and his son Hamid . He was forced to tend the family 's herds of livestock . He had to take them to pastures in the area and to local watering holes , where he saw other Dinka boys who were also forced to tend herds of livestock . He began to suspect that his life was going to change forever and that his father was not going to be able to save him . His attempts to speak to the other Dinka boys were futile , as they were speaking Arabic , which he could not understand ; they also seemed afraid to speak to him . 
 According to Bok , as he grew older , Giemma and Hamid began to place more trust in his abilities as a herdsman . Care of the cattle , horses and camels was passed to Bok and he was able to spend more time alone with the animals . Previously he had been under the careful supervision of Hamid and sometimes Giemma . In addition to having him serve as his slave , Giemma forced Francis to convert to Islam and to take the Arabic name of Abdul Rahman , meaning " servant of the compassionate one . " In his autobiography , Francis states that although he was forced to convert to Islam , that he never stopped praying to God for strength to get him through his ordeal . 
 Bok tried twice to flee from slavery at the age of 14 . The first instance happened early one morning after he had been sent out with the cattle . Bok blindly ran down a road for several miles before he was captured by one of Giemma 's fellow militia members . Giemma 's peer returned Francis to the Giemma 's compound , where he was beaten with a bullwhip . Bok attempted to escape once again just two days later , when he fled in the opposite direction of his previous escape . He once again fled for several miles , this time keeping to the forest . He stopped for water at a local stream crossing , where he was spotted by Giemma who happened to be there as well . Giemma forced Francis back to his home , this time promising to kill him . Francis was beaten again , but Giemma chose not to kill him , as Francis had become too valuable to the family as a slave . 
 = = Escape = = 
 Francis Bok waited three years , until 1996 , before he tried to escape again . During the intervening three years he tended to the herds and regained Giemma 's trust . Giemma regularly praised Bok 's work with the animals yet still forced him to live a life of slavery . 
 Bok finally escaped from Giemma when he was 17 years old by walking through the forest to the nearby market town of Mutari . Bok went to the local police department to seek help , and asked the police to help him find his people . Instead of helping him , the police made him their slave for two months . Bok escaped from the police by simply taking their donkeys to the well , tying them , and leaving them behind as he walked into the crowded marketplace . 
 Bok asked a man with a truck to give him a ride out of Mutari . The man , a Muslim named Abdah , agreed to help him . Abdah thought that slavery was wrong and agreed to transport Bok to the town of Ed @-@ Da <unk> in the back of his truck amongst his cargo of grain and onions . Bok stayed with Abdah , his wife and two sons for two months while Abdah tried to find a way to take Bok to Khartoum , the capital city of Sudan . When he could not find a friend to provide passage to Khartoum , Abdah bought a bus ticket to Khartoum for Bok . Francis Bok arrived in Khartoum with no money , no place to go , and did not know where to turn . Fortunately for Francis , another stranger helped him find his way to his fellow Dinka tribespeople in Khartoum in the <unk> settlement . 
 = = Journey to the United States = = 
 <unk> was filled with Dinka refugees who had fled the fighting in the south of Sudan and were forced to live together in sub @-@ standard conditions . Bok settled among people who were from the <unk> area of North Bahr al Ghazal and began using his Christian name of Francis once again . Bok was quickly arrested by the Sudanese police for telling his friends and neighbors that he was a slave . Slavery in Sudan is a subject that was largely denied by the government in Khartoum and anybody that spoke of it could be arrested or even killed . Francis was interrogated numerous times while he was imprisoned and each time he denied that he was a slave . He was finally released from prison after seven months . Once he was released Bok decided that he must leave Sudan . Through the help of some Dinka tribesman he was able to acquire a Sudanese passport on the black market and obtain a ticket for passage to Cairo . 
 Upon arriving in Cairo in April 1999 , Bok was directed to Sacred Heart Catholic Church . This church was well known among the Dinka in Khartoum as a place of refuge in Cairo . While staying at Sacred Heart , Bok began to learn some English and made important contacts among the Dinka population of Cairo . He also began practicing his Christian faith without fear of reprisal . He eventually moved out of the church compound and into an apartment with other Dinka who were also seeking UN refugee status in order to leave Africa for the United States , Great Britain or Australia . 
 Bok applied for and received UN refugee status on September 15 , 1999 , and after several months of waiting , the United States Immigration and Naturalization Service agreed to allow Francis to move to the U.S. Bok flew from Cairo to New York City on August 13 , 1999 , and from there he flew to Fargo , North Dakota . His journey was sponsored by Lutheran Social Services and a United Methodist Church , both worked together to provide an apartment for Francis in Fargo and helped him find a job . Bok worked several jobs , making pallets and plastic knobs for the gearshift of cars . He heard of a large population of Dinka in Ames , Iowa , and moved to Ames after several months in Fargo . It was while living in Ames that he was contacted by Charles Jacobs , founder of the American Anti @-@ Slavery Group based in Boston , Massachusetts . 
 = = Work as an abolitionist = = 
 Jesse Sage , associate director of the American Anti @-@ slavery Group , and Jacobs persuaded Bok to move to Boston to work with the AASG . He was initially hesitant to leave his new friends in Ames , but according to Bok , the people at AASG were persistent . He arrived in Boston on May 14 , 2000 , AASG helped him find an apartment . A week after moving to Boston , he was invited to speak at a Baptist church in Roxbury and was interviewed by Charles A. Radin of The Boston Globe . Two days after his speech in Roxbury , Bok was asked to meet with supporters of AASG on the steps of the United States Capitol in Washington , D.C. He returned to Washington on September 28 , 2000 , and became the first escaped slave to speak before the United States Senate Committee on Foreign Relations . Francis was invited to Washington again in 2002 for the signing of the Sudan Peace Act and met with President George W. Bush . It was during this trip to the White House that Bok became the first former slave to meet with a U.S. President since the 19th century . 
 Francis Bok has spoken at churches and universities throughout the United States and Canada and he has helped launch the American Anti @-@ Slavery Group 's website <unk> at a Jane 's Addiction concert before an audience of 40 @,@ 000 on April 28 , 2001 . Perry Farrell was a key early supporter of the <unk> movement . Bok has also been honored by the Boston Celtics and was chosen to carry the Olympic Torch past Plymouth Rock prior to the 2002 Winter Olympics . His autobiography , Escape from Slavery : The True Story of My Ten Years in Captivity and My Journey to Freedom in America , was published in 2003 by St. Martin 's Press . 
 Bok currently lives with his wife , <unk> , and their two young children , Buk and Dhai , in Kansas . He is now working in the AASG 's first extension office in Kansas . He also works with Sudan Sunrise , a Lenexa , Kansas @-@ based organization that seeks to work for peace and unity in Sudan .
