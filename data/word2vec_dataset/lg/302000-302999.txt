 Director David Frankel and producer Wendy Finerman had originally read The Devil Wears Prada in book proposal form . It would be Frankel 's second theatrical feature , and his first in over a decade . He , cinematographer Florian Ballhaus and costume designer Patricia Field , drew heavily on their experience in making Sex and the City . 
 Frankel recalls the whole experience as having high stakes for those involved , since for himself and the others behind the camera it was the biggest project they had yet attempted , with barely adequate resources . “ We knew we were on very thin ice , " he told Variety for a 2016 article on the film 's 10th anniversary . " It was possible this could be the end of the road for us . ”

 Fox bought the rights to Weisberger 's novel before it was not only published in 2003 , but even finished . Carla <unk> , then the studio 's executive vice president , had only seen the first hundred pages of manuscript and an outline for how the rest of the plot was to go . But for her that was enough . " I thought Miranda Priestly was one of the greatest villains ever , " she recalled in 2016 . " I remember we aggressively went in and scooped it up . " 
 = = = = Writing = = = = 
 Work on a screenplay started promptly , before Weisberger had even finished her work . When it became a bestseller upon publication , elements of the plot were incorporated into the screenplay in progress . Most took their inspiration from the 2000 Ben Stiller film Zoolander and primarily satirized the fashion industry . But it was still not ready to film . Elizabeth Gabler , later head of production at Fox , noted that the finished novel did not have a strong narrative . " Since there wasn 't a strong third act in the book , " she said later , " we needed to invent that . ” 
 In the meantime , the studio and producer Wendy Finerman sought a director . Out of many candidates with experience in comedy , David Frankel was hired despite his limited experience , having only made one feature , Miami Rhapsody , along with some episodes of Sex and the City and Entourage . He was unsure about the property , calling it " <unk> ... a satire rather than a love story . " Later , he cited <unk> , the 1995 documentary about designer Isaac Mizrahi , as his model for the film 's attitude towards fashion : " [ It ] revels in some of the silliness of the fashion world , but is also very serious . " 
 At a meeting with Finerman , Frankel told her that he thought the story unnecessarily punished Miranda . " My view was that we should be grateful for excellence . Why do the excellent people have to be nice ? ” He prepared to move on and consider more scripts . Two days later his manager persuaded him to reconsider and look for something he liked that he could shape the film into . He took the job , giving Finerman extensive notes on the script and laying out a detailed vision for the film . 
 Four screenwriters worked on the property . Peter Hedges wrote the first draft , but didn 't think he could do more ; another writer passed . Paul Rudnick did some work on Miranda 's scenes , followed by a Don Roos rewrite . After that , Aline Brosh McKenna , who was able to relate her own youthful experiences attempting to launch a journalism career in New York to the story , produced a draft after a month 's work that struck the right balance for Finerman and Frankel , whose notes were incorporated into a final version , rearranging the plot significantly , following the book less closely and focusing the story on the conflict between Andrea and Miranda . She found the experience of writing a story with female protagonists that did not center around a relationship " very liberating ... I felt I was allowed to do what the movie wanted to be , a Faust story , a Wall Street for ladies . " 
 McKenna also initially toned down Miranda 's meanness at the request of Finerman and Frankel , only to restore it later for Streep . She later cited Don Rickles as her main influence for the insults in the dialogue ; before even starting work on the screenplay she had come up with Miranda 's " Take a chance . Hire the smart fat girl " line , which she felt summed up the disparity between Andy and the world she found herself in . 
 McKenna consulted with acquaintances who worked in fashion to make her screenplay more realistic . She told a 2010 British Academy of Film and Television Arts lecture of a scene she had changed after one of these reviews , where Nigel told Andy not to complain so much about her job . Originally , she had made his speech more of a more of a supportive pep talk ; however one of those acquaintances said that would not happen : " [ N ] o @-@ one in that world is nice to each other ... There 's no reason to be , and they don 't have time . " she quoted him as saying . 
 = = = = = Cerulean sweater speech = = = = = 
 The " Cerulean speech " , where Miranda draws the connection between the designer fashion in Runway 's pages and Andy 's cerulean sweater , criticizing Andy 's snobbishness about fashion , had its origins in a scene cut from earlier drafts that Streep had asked to have restored . It slowly grew from a few lines where the editor disparaged her assistant 's fashion sense to a speech about " why she thought fashion was important ... She is so aware that she is affecting billions of people , and what they pick off the floor and what they are putting on their bodies in the morning . " Streep said in 2016 she was interested in " the responsibility lying on the shoulders of a woman who was the head of a global brand ... That scene wasn ’ t about the fun of fashion , it was about marketing and business . " 
 McKenna recalls that she kept expanding it to suit Streep and Frankel , but even a few days before it was scheduled to be filmed she was unsure if it would used or even shot . She was revising it at a nearby Starbucks when she realized that Miranda would describe something not as just blue — chosen as the color for Andy 's sweater since it would work best on screen — but would instead use an exact shade . From a list she sent of shades Streep picked cerulean ; the final speech takes up almost a page of the script , long for a mainstream film . " I was like , it 'd be cool if half of that ended up in the movie , " the writer says . " Every word is in the movie . " The references to past designer collections are entirely fictional , McKenna explains , since the speech was written around the sweater 's color ( however , the Huffington Post later pointed out , designers often take their fashion inspiration from the streets ) . 
 The speech has become one of the film 's most memorable moments ; " Miranda 's signature monologue " to The Ringer . " ' Cerulean ' [ has never ] sounded more sinister , " the Huffington Post wrote in 2016 , Liz Jones , former editor of British Marie Claire , said it was " a rare glimpse at the way in which even the most outlandish and extreme exponents of fashion ... influence and enrich all our lives , even if we only ever shop at Marks & Spencer or Gap . "

 Once the script was finished , the filmmakers and Fox focused on getting Meryl Streep to play Miranda ; Hacken recalled she was seen as so perfect for the part that no one had discussed any alternatives ( although McKenna recalls writing provisional dialogue should the producers have had to settle for another actress ) . Weisberger , who initially couldn 't imagine Streep playing the part , recalled that after seeing her on set it was " crystal clear " that she was perfect for the role . 
 The news that Streep would meet with Frankel was celebrated at Fox . But while Streep , for her part , knew the movie could be very successful , she felt the pay she was being offered for playing Miranda was " slightly , if not insulting , not perhaps reflective of my actual value to the project . " The producers doubled it to around $ 4 million , and she signed on , allowing Fox to greenlight the film . According to Frankel , Streep saw the film as a chance to " skewer the <unk> of the fashion world . " She has three daughters , and as an ardent feminist , felt that fashion magazines " twisted the minds of young women around the world and their priorities . This was an interesting way to get back at them . " Also , she said , the film passed the Bechdel test . 
 She insisted on the scenes where she explains to Andy the connection between the blue sweater she 's wearing and the haute couture industry , and the scene where Miranda briefly opens up to Andy , without makeup , about her divorce . " I wanted , ” she explained , “ to see that face without it protective glaze , to glimpse the woman in the businesswoman . ” 
 Casting Andy was less clear @-@ cut . Fox wanted an A @-@ list younger actress , and felt Rachel McAdams , then coming off successes in The Notebook and Mean Girls , would help the film 's commercial prospects . However , she declined several offers to play Andy , telling the studio she was trying to avoid mainstream projects for a while . 
 Hathaway , by contrast , actively sought the part , tracing " Hire me " in the sand of the Zen garden on Hacken 's desk when she talked about the project with the executive . While Frankel liked her enough to not require her to audition , she knew she was not the studio 's first choice and had to be patient ( other accounts say that she was the only actress considered for the lead ) . Fox production chief Elizabeth Gabler says the studio did not realize how strong her audience was after the Princess Diaries movies . She took the part to work with Streep , but also due to some personal aspects . She , too , celebrated when she learned she had gotten the part . 
 Over a hundred actresses had been considered for Emily before one of the casting agents taped Emily Blunt reading some of the lines elsewhere on the Fox lot as she was leaving for her flight to London following her audition for Eragon . Although she read them in her native British accent despite the character being written as American as she is in the novel , Frankel was interested ; Finerman liked her for her sense of humor . After the makers of Eragon cast another actress , Frankel called her in the bathroom of " some dive club " in London , where she was consoling herself with her sister . He told her that while he would have cast her just from the tape , the studio wanted to see another audition with her dressed more in character . She insisted on continuing to play the character as British ; Both Hathaway and Emily Blunt lost weight for their roles , with Hathaway later recounting that " [ she ] and I would clutch at each other and cry because we were so hungry . " Blunt later denied rumors she did this at the filmmakers ' request . 
 Tucci was one of the last actors cast ; he agreed to play Nigel only three days before shooting started . The filmmakers reportedly had auditioned Barney 's creative director Simon Doonan and E ! ' s Robert Verdi , both openly gay men highly visible as media fashion commentators , for the part . Verdi would later claim there was no intention to actually hire him and the producers had just used him and Doonan to give whoever they ultimately did cast some filmed research to use in playing a gay character ( he would end up with a walk @-@ on part as a fashion journalist in Paris ) . Tucci claims he was unaware of this : " All I know is that someone called me and I realized this was a great part . " He based the character on various people he was acquainted with , insisting on the glasses he ultimately wore . Sunjata had originally read for Tucci 's part , rather unenthusiastically since he had just finished playing a similar character , but then read the Holt part and asked if he could audition for it . Baker auditioned by sending a video of himself , wearing the same self @-@ designed green jacket he has on when he and Andrea meet for the first time . 
 Weisberger is widely believed to have based Miranda on Anna Wintour , the powerful editor of Vogue . Wintour reportedly warned major fashion designers who had been invited to make cameo appearances as themselves in the film that they would be banished from the magazine 's pages if they did so . Vogue and other major women 's and fashion magazines have avoided reviewing or even mentioning the book in their pages . Wintour 's spokespeople deny the claim , but costume designer Patricia Field says many designers told her they did not want to risk Wintour 's wrath . 
 Only Valentino , who had designed the black gown Streep wears in the museum benefit scene , chose to make an appearance . Coincidentally , he was in New York during production and Finerman dared Field , an acquaintance , to ask him personally . Much to her surprise , he accepted . Other cameos of note include Heidi Klum as herself and Weisberger as the twins ' nanny . Streep 's daughter 's film debut as a barista at Starbucks was cut . Gisele Bündchen agreed to be in the movie only if she did not play a model . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Principal photography took place over 57 days in New York and Paris between October and December 2005 . The film 's budget was $ 41 million . It was originally lower , which caused problems with some locations — the crew could not get permission to shoot at the Museum of Modern Art or Bryant Park . 
 Ballhaus , at Finerman and Frankel 's suggestion , composed as many shots as possible , whether interiors or exteriors , to at least partially take in busy New York street scenes in the background , to convey the excitement of working in a glamorous industry in New York . He also used a handheld camera during some of the busier meeting scenes in Miranda 's office , to better convey the flow of action , and slow motion for Andrea 's entrance into the office following her makeover . A few process shots were necessary , mainly to put exterior views behind windows on sets and in the Mercedes where Miranda and Andrea are having their climactic conversation . 
 Fox originally refused permission to let Frankel shoot some scenes from the third act in Paris , where it is set , due to the low budget . But after six " nightmarish " weeks of shooting , he had an editor cut a " sizzle reel " of highlights . That convinced the studio to increase the budget to allow for limited shooting overseas ( Streep did not go as Fox believed it would be too expensive ) .

 Several weeks after all the major parts had been cast , the actors gathered in New York for a table read . Hathaway was nervous and goofy , she recalls , since she still had not developed her idea of the part ; she described her performance at that point as " [ nothing ] particularly impressive . " Blunt , by contrast , found Streep 's laugh relaxed her enough to keep her focused on playing a nervous , distracted Emily . The highlight of the session was Streep 's first line as Miranda . Instead of the " strident , bossy , barking voice " everyone expected , Hathaway says , Streep silenced the room by speaking in a near whisper . " It was so unexpected and brilliant . " At the reading Streep also changed Miranda 's last line to " everybody wants to be us " from the original " me " . 
 Streep made a conscious decision not to play the part as a direct impression of Wintour , right down to not using an accent and making the character American rather than English ( " I felt it was too restricting " ) . " I think she wanted people not to confuse the character of Miranda Priestly with Anna Wintour at all , " said Frankel . " And that 's why early on in the process she decided on a very different look for her and a different approach to the character . " The " that 's all , " " please bore someone else ... " catchphrases ; her coat @-@ tossing on Andrea 's desk and discarded steak lunch are retained from the novel . Streep prepared by reading a book by Wintour protégé Liz <unk> and the memos of Vogue editor Diana Vreeland . She lost so much weight during shooting that the clothes had to be taken in . 
 During the movie 's press tour she also said her performance as Miranda was inspired by different men she knew , but did not say which ones . In 2016 she disclosed to Variety that she took Miranda 's soft speaking style from Clint Eastwood : " He never , ever , ever raises his voice and everyone has to lean in to listen , and he is automatically the most powerful person in the room . " However , she said , Eastwood does not make jokes , so instead she modeled that aspect of the character on theatrical and film director Mike <unk> whose delivery of a cutting remark , she said , made everyone laugh , including the target . " The walk , I ’ m afraid , is mine , ” Streep added . 
 For Miranda 's actual look , Streep looked to two women . The bouffant hairstyle was inspired by model and actress Carmen Dell <unk> , which Streep said she wanted to blend with " the unassailable elegance and authority of [ French politician ] Christine Lagarde . " The costumes Field designed for that look resulted in numerous blown takes during the montage where Miranda repeatedly throws her overcoat on Andrea 's desk when she arrives in the morning . When McKenna saw Streep as Miranda for the first time on set , she recalls being so terrified she threw her arm in front of Frankel " like we were in a car wreck . " 
 Hathaway prepared for the part by volunteering for a week as an assistant at an auction house where she was " put through the wringer " according to Weisberger , who adds that Hathaway supplemented that by asking her many questions about working for Wintour . Frankel recalls that she was nervous through most of the shooting , particularly when working late , since Raffaello <unk> , her boyfriend at that time , preferred strongly that she not do so ; she was also having health issues due to a cyst . The director said she was " terrified " before starting her first scene with Streep , who had begun her working relationship with Hathaway by saying first " I think you 're perfect for the role and I 'm so happy we 're going to be working on this together " then warning her that was the last nice thing she would say . Streep applied this philosophy to everyone else on set as well , keeping her distance from the cast and crew members unless it was necessary to discuss something with them . 
 She also suggested the editorial meeting scene , which does not advance the plot but shows Miranda at work without Andrea present . It was also her idea that Miranda not wear makeup in the scene where she opens up to Andrea and worries about the effect on her daughters of her divorce becoming public knowledge . Blunt , for her part , contributed the line where she tells Andy " I 'm hearing this " , while opening and closing her hand , " and I want to hear this " keeping it closed . In 2015 she told Howard Stern that she had overheard a mother saying that to a child in a supermarket during production . 
 = = = = Costuming = = = = 
 Frankel , who had worked with Patricia Field on his feature @-@ film debut Miami Rhapsody as well as Sex and the City , knew that what the cast wore would be of utmost importance in a movie set in the fashion industry . " My approach was to hire her and then leave the room , " he joked later . While only Valentino Garavani appeared onscreen , many other designers were helpful to Field . Her $ 100 @,@ 000 budget for the film 's costumes was supplemented by help from friends throughout the industry . Ultimately , she believes , at least $ 1 million worth of clothing was used in the film , making it one of the most expensively costumed movies in cinema history . The single <unk> item was a $ 100 @,@ 000 Fred Leighton necklace on Streep . 
 When Hathaway enters the office after Nigel gives her access to Runway 's closet , she is dressed entirely in Chanel . Field explained in 2016 that " I felt Annie Hathaway was a Chanel girl organically , as opposed to let 's say a Versace [ or Roberto Cavalli ] girl . " When she called the company to ask for assistance , they were delighted because " they wanted to see Chanel on a young girl to give it another point of view , " showing it as a brand for " not just middle @-@ aged women in suits , but youthful and funky . " Calvin Klein rounds out Andrea 's wardrobe . 
 Dolce & Gabbana and Calvin Klein helped Field as well , with some contributions from Lebanese designer Georges Chakra . Although Field avoids making Streep look like Wintour , she dresses her in generous helpings of Prada . ( By Field 's own estimate , 40 % of the shoes on Streep 's feet are Prada . ) Field added that much of the audience would not be familiar with Wintour 's look and that " Meryl looks nothing like Anna , so even if I wanted to copy Anna , I couldn 't . " But , like Wintour and her Vogue predecessor Diana Vreeland , the two realized that Miranda needed a signature look , which was provided primarily by the white wig and forelock she wore as well as the clothes the two spent much time poring over look @-@ books for . " [ I ] n choosing her wardrobe my idea was that she ’ s a chief fashion editor , she has her own style , " Fields told Women 's Wear Daily in 2016 . " We ’ re creating an original character . " 
 Field said she avoided prevailing fashion trends for Miranda during production in favor of a more timeless look based on Donna Karan archives and pieces by <unk> <unk> for Bill Blass , a look she describes as " rich @-@ lady clothes . " She did not want people to easily recognize what Miranda was wearing . 
 She contrasted Andrea and Emily by giving Andrea a " textbook " sense of style , without much risk @-@ taking , that would suggest clothing a fashion magazine would have on hand for shoots . Blunt , on the other hand was " so on the edge she 's almost falling off . " For her , Field chose pieces by Vivienne Westwood and Rick Owens to suggest a taste for funkier , more " underground " clothing . After the film 's release , some of the looks Field chose became popular , to the filmmakers ' amusement . 
 Tucci praised Field 's skill in putting ensembles together that were not only stylish but helped him develop his character : 
 She just sort of sits there with her cigarette and her hair , and she would pull stuff — these very disparate elements — and put them together into this ensemble , and you 'd go , " Come on , Pat , you can 't wear that with that . " She 'd say , " Eh , just try it on . " So you 'd put it on , and not only did it work , but it works on so many different levels — and it allows you to figure out who the guy is . Those outfits achieve exactly what I was trying to achieve . There 's flamboyance , there 's real risk @-@ taking , but when I walk into the room , it 's not flashy . It 's actually very subtle . You look at it and you go , " That shirt , that tie , that jacket , that vest ? What ? " But it works . 
 He found one Dries van <unk> tie he wore during the film to his liking and kept it .

 After touring some offices of real fashion magazines , Jess <unk> gave the Runway offices a clean , white look meant to suggest a makeup compact ( " the chaste <unk> and whites of impervious authority , " Denby called it ) . Miranda 's office bears some strong similarities to the real office of Anna Wintour , down to an octagonal mirror on the wall , photographs and a floral arrangement on the desk ( a similarity so marked Wintour had her office redecorated after the movie ) . The magazine itself is very similar to Vogue , and one of the covers on the wall of the office , showing three models , is a direct homage to the August 2004 cover of that magazine . 
 She even chose separate computer wallpaper to highlight different aspects of Blunt 's and Hathaway 's character : Paris 's Arc de Triomphe on Blunt 's suggests her aspirations to accompany Miranda to the shows there , while the floral image on Andy 's suggests the natural , unassuming qualities she displays at the outset of her tenure with the magazine . For the photo of Andrea with her parents , Hathaway posed with her own mother and David Marshall Grant . One of the purported Harry Potter manuscripts was later sold at auction for $ 586 on eBay , along with various clothing used in the film , to benefit Dress for Success , a charity which provides business clothing to help women transition into the workforce .

 Mark Livolsi realized , as McKenna had on the other end , that the film worked best when it focused on the Andrea @-@ Miranda storyline . Accordingly , he cut a number of primarily transitional scenes , such as Andrea 's job interview and the Runway staff 's trip to Holt 's studio . He also took out a scene early on where Miranda complimented Andrea . Upon reviewing them for the DVD , Frankel admitted he hadn 't even seen them before , since Livolsi didn 't include them in any prints he sent to the director . 
 Frankel praised Livolsi for making the film 's four key montages — the opening credits , Miranda 's coat @-@ tossing , Andrea 's makeover and the Paris introduction — work . The third was particularly challenging as it uses passing cars and other obstructions to cover Hathaway 's changes of outfit . Some scenes were also created in the editing room , such as the reception at the museum , where Livolsi wove B @-@ roll footage in to keep the action flowing . 
 = = = = Music = = = = 
 Composer Theodore Shapiro relied heavily on guitar and percussion , with the backing of a full orchestra , to capture a contemporary urban sound . He ultimately wrote 35 minutes of music for the film , which were performed and recorded by the Hollywood Studio Symphony , conducted by Pete Anthony . His work was balanced with songs by U2 ( " City of Blinding Lights " , Miranda and Andrea in Paris ) , Madonna ( " Vogue " & " Jump " , Andrea 's fashion montage & her first day on the job , respectively ) , KT Tunstall ( " Suddenly I See " , female montage during opening credits ) , Alanis Morissette ( " Crazy " , Central Park photo shoot ) , Bitter : Sweet ( " Our Remains , " Andrea picks up James Holt 's sketches for Miranda ; Bittersweet Faith , Lily 's art show ) , Azure Ray ( " Sleep , " following the breakdown of her relationship with Nate ) , Jamiroquai ( " Seven Days in Sunny June , " Andrea and Christian meet at James Holt 's party ) among others . Frankel had wanted to use " City of Blinding Lights " in the film after he had used it as a soundtrack to a video montage of Paris scenes he had put together after scouting locations there . Likewise , Field had advocated just as strongly for " Vogue . " 
 The soundtrack album was released on July 11 by Warner Music . It includes all the songs mentioned above ( except Madonna 's " Jump " ) as well as a suite of Shapiro 's themes . Among the tracks not included is " Suddenly I See , " which disappointed many fans . It became popular as a result of the film although the single did not crack the U.S. Top Forty . It nonetheless became a popular radio hit . 
 = = Pre @-@ release and marketing = = 
 Originally intended just to convince Fox to fund some shooting in Paris , Frankel 's sizzle reel led the studio to put a stronger marketing push behind the movie . It moved the release date from February to summer , scheduling it as a lighter alternative audiences could consider to Superman Returns at the end of June 2006 , and began to position it as an event movie in and of itself . 
 Two decisions by the studio 's marketing department that were meant to be preliminary wound up being integral to promoting the film . The first was the creation of the red stiletto heel ending in a pitchfork as the film 's teaser poster . It was so successful and effective , becoming almost " iconic " ( in Finerman 's words ) , that it was used for the actual release poster as well . It became a brand , and was eventually used on every medium related to the film — the tie @-@ in reprinting of the novel and the soundtrack and DVD covers as well . 
 The studio also put together a trailer of scenes and images strictly from the first three minutes of the film , in which Andrea meets Miranda for the first time , to be used at previews and film festivals until they could create a more standard trailer drawing from the whole film . But , again , this proved so effective with early audiences it was retained as the main trailer , since it created anticipation for the rest of the film without giving anything away . 
 Gabler credits the studio 's marketing team for being " really creative " . Fox saw the film as " <unk> " on the weekend Superman Returns was released . While they knew that the material and Hathaway would help draw a younger female audience that would not be as interested in seeing that film , " [ w ] e didn ’ t want it to just seem like a chick flick coming out . "

 The Devil Wears Prada received positive reviews from critics . On Rotten Tomatoes the film has a rating of 75 % , based on 185 reviews , with the site 's critical consensus reads , " A rare film that surpasses the quality of its source novel , this Devil is a witty expose of New York 's fashion scene , with Meryl Streep in top form and Anne Hathaway more than holding her own " On Metacritic , the film has a score of 62 out of 100 , based on 40 critics , indicating " generally favorable reviews " . 
 Initial reviews of the film focused primarily on Streep 's performance , praising her for making an extremely unsympathetic character far more complex than she had been in the novel . " With her silver hair and pale skin , her whispery diction as perfect as her posture , Ms. Streep 's Miranda inspires both terror and a measure of awe , " wrote A. O. Scott in The New York Times . " No longer simply the incarnation of evil , she is now a vision of aristocratic , purposeful and surprisingly human grace . " Kyle Smith agreed at the New York Post : " The snaky Streep wisely chooses not to imitate Vogue <unk> Anna Wintour , the inspiration for the book , but creates her own surprisingly believable character . " 
 David Edelstein , in New York magazine , criticized the film as " thin " , but praised Streep for her " fabulous minimalist performance . " J. Hoberman , Edelstein 's onetime colleague at The Village Voice , called the movie an improvement on the book and said Streep was " the scariest , most nuanced , funniest movie villainess since Tilda Swinton 's <unk> White Witch [ in 2005 's The Chronicles of Narnia : The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe ] . " 
 Blunt , too , earned some favorable notice . " [ She ] has many of the movie 's best lines and steals nearly every scene she 's in , " wrote Clifford Pugh in the Houston Chronicle . Other reviewers and fans concurred . While all critics were in agreement about Streep and Blunt , they pointed to other weaknesses , particularly in the story . Reviewers familiar with Weisberger 's novel assented to her judgment that McKenna 's script greatly improved upon it . A rare exception was Angela Baldassare at The Microsoft Network Canada , who felt the film needed more of the nastiness others had told her was abundant in the novel . 
 David Denby summed up this response in his New Yorker review : " The Devil Wears Prada tells a familiar story , and it never goes much below the surface of what it has to tell . Still , what a surface ! " Reactions to Hathaway 's performance were not as unanimous as for many of her costars . Denby said " she suggests , with no more than a panicky sidelong glance , what Weisberger takes pages to describe . " On the other hand , to Baldassare , she " barely <unk> [ d ] the load . " 
 = = = = Depiction of fashion industry = = = = 
 Some media outlets allowed their present or former fashion reporters to weigh in on how realistic the movie was . Their responses varied widely . Booth Moore at Los Angeles Times chided Field for creating a " fine fashion fantasy with little to do with reality , " a world that reflects what outsiders think fashion is like rather than what the industry actually is . Unlike the movie , in her experience fashionistas were less likely to wear makeup and more likely to value edgier dressing styles ( that would not include toe rings ) . " If they want a documentary , they can watch the History Channel " , retorted Field . Another newspaper fashion writer , Hadley Freeman of The Guardian , likewise complained the film was awash in the sexism and clichés that , to her , beset movies about fashion in general . 
 Charla Krupp , the executive editor of <unk> , Inc . , says " It 's the first film I 've seen that got it right ... [ It ] has the nuances of the politics and the tension better than any film — and the backstabbing and sucking @-@ up . " Joanna Coles , the editor of the U.S. edition of Marie Claire , agreed : 
 The film brilliantly skewers a particular kind of young woman who lives , breathes , thinks fashion above all else ... those young women who are prepared to die rather than go without the latest Muse bag from Yves Saint Laurent that costs three times their monthly salary . It 's also accurate in its understanding of the relationship between the editor @-@ in @-@ chief and the assistant . 
 Ginia <unk> , former fashion reporter for The New York Times , called it " easily the truest portrayal of fashion culture since <unk> " and giving it credit for depicting the way fashion had changed in the early 21st century . Her colleague Ruth La Ferla found a different opinion from industry insiders after a special preview screening . Most found the fashion in the movie too safe and the beauty too overstated , more in tune with the 1980s than the 2000s . " My job is to present an entertainment , a world people can visit and take a little trip , " responded Field . 
 Liz Jones , former editor of British Marie Claire , wrote in the Daily Mail that the movie was " a chilling reminder of the most surreal three years of my life . " The only detail she found inaccurate was the absence of flowers in <unk> 's Paris hotel room — during her tenure as editor , her rooms there or in Milan received so many flowers from designers that she thought she " had died prematurely . " She personally vouched for Miranda 's personality : " It took only a few weeks in the job for me to mutate into that strangely exotic and spoilt creature : the magazine maven , whose every whim , like those of Miranda ... must be pandered to . "

 On its June 30 opening weekend , right before the Independence Day holiday , the film was on 2 @,@ 847 screens . Through that Sunday , July 2 , it grossed $ 27 million , second only to the much bigger @-@ budget Superman Returns , breaking The Patriot 's six @-@ year @-@ old record for the largest take by a movie released that holiday weekend that did not win the weekend ; a record that stood until Ice Age : Dawn of the Dinosaurs broke it in 2009 . 
 During its first week it added $ 13 million . This success led Fox to add 35 more screens the next weekend , the widest domestic distribution the film enjoyed . Although it was never any week 's top @-@ grossing film , it remained in the top 10 through July . Its theatrical run continued through December 10 , shortly before the DVD release . 
 " The core marketing was definitely to women , " Gabler recalls , " but the men didn 't resist going to the movie . " She felt that male viewers responded favorably to the movie because they sought a glimpse inside fashion , and because Miranda " was enjoyable to watch . " The release date helped generate word of mouth when people who had seen it discussed it at holiday gatherings . " They were talking about it , like a summer reading book , " said Gabler . 
 It had a very successful run in theaters , making nearly $ 125 million in the United States and Canada and over $ 325 million worldwide , a career high for all three top @-@ billed actresses at that time . Streep would surpass it two years later with Mamma Mia while Hathaway exceeded it with 2010 's Alice in Wonderland . Blunt would not be in a higher @-@ grossing film until the 2014 movie adaptation of the Broadway musical Into the Woods ( also starring Streep ) . 
 It was also Tucci 's highest @-@ grossing film until Captain America : The First Avenger in 2011 .

 Anna Wintour attended the film 's New York premiere , wearing Prada . Her friend Barbara Amiel reported that she said shortly afterward that the movie would go straight to DVD . But in an interview with Barbara Walters that aired the day the DVD was released , she called the film " really entertaining " and said she appreciated the " decisive " nature of Streep 's portrayal . " Anything that makes fashion entertaining and glamorous and interesting is wonderful for our industry . So I was 100 percent behind it . " Streep said Wintour was " probably more upset by the book than the film . " 
 = = = International = = = 
 Weisberger 's novel had been translated into 37 different languages , giving the movie a strong potential foreign audience . The international box office would ultimately deliver 60 % of the film 's gross . " We did our European premiere at the Venice Film Festival " , Gabler says , where the city 's gondoliers wore red T @-@ shirts with the film 's logo . " So many people around the world were captivated by the glossy fashion world . It was sexy and international . " 
 The Devil Wears Prada topped the charts on its first major European release weekend on October 9 , after a strong September Oceania and Latin America opening . It would be the highest @-@ grossing film that weekend in Britain , Spain and Russia , taking in $ 41 @.@ 5 million overall . Continued strong weekends as it opened across the rest of Europe helped it remain atop the overseas charts for the rest of the month . By the end of the year only its Chinese opening remained ; it was released there at the end of February 2007 and took in $ 2 @.@ 4 million . 
 The greatest portion of the $ 201 @.@ 8 million total international box office came from the United Kingdom , with $ 26 @.@ 5 million . Germany was next with $ 23 @.@ 1 million , followed by Italy at $ 19 @.@ 3 million and France at $ 17 @.@ 9 million . Outside Europe , Japanese box office was the highest at $ 14 @.@ 6 million , followed by Australia at $ 12 @.@ 6 million . 
 Most reviews from the international press echoed the domestic response , heaping praise on Streep and the other actors , but calling the whole film " predictable . " The Guardian 's Peter Bradshaw , who found the film " moderately entertaining , " took Blunt to task , calling her a " real disappointment ... strained and awkward . " In The Independent , Anthony Quinn said Streep " may just have given us a classic here " and concluded that the film as a whole was " as snappy and juicy as fresh bubblegum . " 
 In most markets the title remained unchanged ; either the English was used or a translation into the local language . The only exceptions were Chile , Colombia , Ecuador , Mexico and Venezuela , where it was El diablo que <unk> Prada and El diablo se <unk> a la <unk> . In Poland , the title was <unk> <unk> się u Prady which roughly means " The Devil dresses ( itself ) at Prada " rather than " The Devil Wears Prada . " In Italian the title was ″ Il <unk> <unk> Prada " which roughly means " The devil wears Prada " . In Turkey , the title was " <unk> Marka <unk> , " roughly translated as " The Devil Wears Brand @-@ Names . " In Romania , the title was " <unk> se <unk> de la Prada , " which roughly means " The Devil Dresses itself from Prada " , the same construction being found in the French title , " Le Diable s <unk> en Prada " . The Japanese version is titled " <unk> " , which translates as " The devil wearing Prada " . 
 = = = Awards and nominations = = = 
 Three months after the film 's North American release ( October 2006 ) , Frankel and Weisberger jointly accepted the first Quill Variety Blockbuster Book to Film Award . A committee of staffers at the magazine made the nominations and chose the award winner . Editor Peter Bart praised both works . 
 The Devil Wears Prada ' is an energetically directed , perfect @-@ fit of a film that has surprised some in the industry with its box @-@ office legs . It has delighted the country , much as did Lauren Weisberger 's book , which is still going strong on several national bestseller lists 
 The film was honored by the National Board of Review as one of the year 's ten best . The American Film Institute gave the film similar recognition . 
 The film received ample attention from the Hollywood Foreign Press Association when its Golden Globe Award nominations were announced on December 14 , 2006 . The film itself was in the running for Best Picture ( Comedy / Musical ) and Supporting Actress ( for Blunt ) . Streep later won the Globe for Best Actress ( Musical / Comedy ) . 
 On January 4 , 2007 , her fellow members of the Screen Actors Guild nominated Streep for Best Actress as well . Four days later , at the National Society of Film Critics awards , Streep won Best Supporting Actress for her work both in Devil and A Prairie Home Companion . McKenna earned a nomination from the Writers Guild of America Award for Best Adapted Screenplay on January 11 , 2007 . 
 The following day , the British Academy of Film and Television Arts announced its 2006 nominations ; Blunt , Field , McKenna and Streep were all among the nominees , as were makeup artist and <unk> Nicki <unk> and Angel de Angelis . 
 On January 23 , 2007 , Streep received her 14th Academy Award nomination for Best Actress , lengthening her record from 13 for most nominations by any actor male or female . Field received a Costume Design nomination as well . Neither won , but Blunt and Hathaway presented the last mentioned award , amusing the audience by slipping into their characters for a few lines , nervously asking which of them had gotten Streep her cappuccino . Streep played along with a stern expression before smiling .

 The success of the film led to a proposed , but unrealized , American dramedy series that was in contention to air for the 2007 – 08 television season on Fox . It was to be produced by Fox Television Studios , with the premise adjusted for the confines of a traditional half @-@ hour or one @-@ hour dramedy with a single camera set @-@ up . However , it never reached the point of even producing a pilot episode . 
 With the video release came renewed interest in Weisberger 's novel . It ranked eighth on USA <unk> list of 2006 best sellers and was the second most borrowed book in American libraries . The audiobook version was released in October 2006 and quickly made it to third on that medium 's fiction best seller list . 
 In 2015 , it was reported that Broadway producer Kevin McCollum had signed a deal two years earlier with Fox to develop some of the movies from its back catalog into musicals for the stage . Two he expressed particular interest in were Mrs. Doubtfire and The Devil Wears Prada . While he first chose an adaptation of Ever After , a 1998 Drew Barrymore film , theater enthusiasts were intrigued by the possibility of a Devil Wears Prada musical . " [ It ] isn 't terrible source material , " observed The A.V. Club , which speculated that Patti Lupone or Bernadette Peters might make a memorable Miranda on stage .

 The DVD was released on December 12 , 2006 and has , in addition to the film , the following extras : 
 Audio commentary from Frankel , editor Mark Livolsi , Field , screenwriter Aline Brosh McKenna , producer Wendy Finerman and cinematographer Florian Ballhaus . 
 A five @-@ minute blooper reel featuring , among other shots , unintentional pratfalls by Hathaway due to the high stiletto heels she had to wear . It also includes gag shots such as a chubby crewmember in loose @-@ fitting clothing walking along the runway at the fashion show , and Streep announcing " I have some nude photographs to show you " at the Paris brunch scene . Unlike most blooper reels , it is not a collection of sequential takes but rather a fast @-@ paced montage set to music from the film with many backstage shots and a split screenshot allowing the viewer to compare the actual shot with the blooper . The many shots of actors touching their noses are , Rich Sommer says , a game played to assign blame for ruined takes . 
 Five featurettes 
 " Trip to the Big Screen " , a 12 @-@ minute look at the film 's pre @-@ production , discussing the changes made from the novel , how Frankel was chosen to direct and other issues . 
 " NYC and Fashion " , a look at the real New York fashion scene and how it is portrayed in the film . 
 " Fashion Visionary Patricia Field " , a profile of the film 's costume designer . 
 " Getting Valentino " , covering how the designer was persuaded to appear as himself in the film . 
 " Boss from Hell " , a short segment on difficult , nightmarish superiors like Priestly .

 Closed captions in French and Spanish are also available . The DVD is available in both full screen and widescreen versions . Pictures of the cast and the tagline " Hell on Heels " were added to the red @-@ heel image for the cover . It was released in the UK on February 5 , 2007 . 
 A Blu @-@ ray Disc of the film was released simultaneously with the DVD . The Blu @-@ ray maintains the same features as the DVD ; however , the featurettes were dropped and replaced with a subtitle pop @-@ up trivia track that can be watched by itself or along with the audio commentary .

 Immediately upon its December 12 release , it became the top rental in the USA .

 Among the deleted scenes are some that added more background information to the story , with commentary available by the editor and director . Most were deleted by Livolsi in favor of keeping the plot focused on the conflict between Miranda and Andrea , often without consulting Frankel . 
 Frankel generally approved of his editor 's choices , but differed on one scene , showing Andrea on her errand to the Calvin Klein showroom . He felt that scene showed Andrea 's job was about more than running personal errands for Miranda . 
 = = Cultural impact and legacy = = 
 In 2016 , around the 10th anniversary of the film 's release , Vanity Fair did a rundown of some Independence Day weekend movie box results from the previous 15 years , noting how some better @-@ remembered films had been bested by films that have not stood the test of time . It called Superman Returns ' win over The Devil Wears Prada the " most ironic " of these victories . " [ T ] he degree to which [ it ] has penetrated pop culture needs no explanation – as does the degree to which Superman Returns didn 't . " 
 The cast 's opinions on why the movie has endured differ . Hathaway told Variety that she thinks many people relate to Andy 's predicament of working for someone who seems impossible to please . " Everybody has had an experience like this . " Tucci did not believe specific explanations were necessary . " It ’ s a fucking brilliant movie ... The brilliant movies become influential , no matter what they are about . " 
 = = = Cast = = = 
 The cast members bonded tightly on the set , and remained close afterwards . Blunt invited them to her wedding to John Krasinski in 2010 . There , Tucci met her sister Felicity , whom he later married . " Ten years after The Devil Wears Prada , Stanley is in my actual family , " she told Variety . " How frightening is that ? " 
 In its anniversary story , Variety argued that it had benefited all three of its lead actresses . In addition to Streep 's record @-@ setting Oscar nomination , the <unk> observed , it had proven that she could be a box @-@ office draw by herself , opening doors up for her to be cast as a lead in later summer movies such as Julie & Julia and Mamma Mia ! . For Hathaway , it was her first leading role in a film intended for an adult audience . Subsequent producers were impressed that she had held her own playing opposite Streep , which led eventually to her being cast in more serious roles like Rachel Getting Married and Les Misérables , for which she won an Oscar . " I think what people saw was promising — it made people want to see more . " 
 Hathaway believes that Blunt 's career took off because of her role . " I 've never witnessed a star being born before , " Hathaway says . " That 's the first time I watched it happen . " Blunt agrees that it was " a night and day change " for her — the day after the film was released , she told Variety , the staff at the coffee shop she had been going to for breakfast every morning in Los Angeles suddenly recognized her . Even ten years later , people still quote her lines from the film back to her at least once a week , she says . 
 = = = Audience demographics = = = 
 " [ The film ] definitely paved the way for the filmmakers and distributors of the world to know that there was a female audience that was really strong out there " , Gabler recalls , one that was not segmented by age . She pointed to later movies , such as Mamma Mia ! , 27 Dresses ( written by McKenna ) and Me Before You , that appeared to her to be trying to replicate The Devil Wears Prada 's success with that demographic . However , Gabler feels they did not do so as well . " Prada reminds me of movies that we don 't have a lot of now — it harkens back to classic movies that had so much more than just one kind of plot line ... You just keep wanting to find something that can touch upon the same zeitgeist as this film . " 
 For Streep , the most significant thing about the film was that " [ t ] his was the first time , on any movie I have ever made , where men came up to me and said , ' I know what you felt like , this is kind of like my life . ' That was for me the most ground @-@ breaking thing about Devil Wears Prada — it engaged men on a visceral level , " she told Indiewire . 
 = = = Popular culture and society = = = 
 The film has made a lasting impact on popular culture . Although a TV series based on it was not picked up , in the years after its release The Simpsons titled an episode " The Devil Wears Nada " and parodied some scenes . The American version of The Office began an episode with Steve Carell as Michael Scott imitating Miranda after watching the film on Netflix . 
 In 2008 , The New York Times wrote that the movie had defined the image of a personal assistant in the public mind . Seven years later , Dissent 's Francesca Mari wrote about " the assistant economy " by which many creative professionals rely on workers so titled to do menial personal and professional tasks for them ; she pointed to The Devil Wears Prada as the best @-@ known narrative of assistantship . The next year , writing about a proposed change in U.S. federal overtime regulations that was seen as threatening to that practice , the Times called it the ' Devil Wears Prada ' economy " , a term other news outlets also used . 
 On the film 's 10th anniversary , Alyssa Rosenberg wrote in The Washington Post that Miranda anticipated female <unk> of popular television series of the later 2000s and 2010s such <unk> ; ' s Olivia Pope and Cersei Lannister in Game of Thrones . Like them , she observes , Miranda competently assumes a position of authority often held by male characters , despite her moral failings , that she must defend against attempts to use her personal life to remove her from it , to " prov [ e ] , as a creature of sentiment , that she never belonged there in the first place . " In doing so , however successfully to herself and others , " she has zipped herself into a life as regimented and limited as a skintight pencil skirt . " 
 " Like many instant classics , Prada benefited from perfect timing " , Variety 's 2016 article observed , attempting to explain the film 's enduring appeal . " It marked the beginning of the democratization of the fashion industry — when the masses started to pay attention to the business of what they wore . " It credited the movie with helping stir interest in the American adaptation of the Colombian television series Ugly Betty , which debuted months after its release . 
 The film also has been credited with increasing interest in R.J. Cutler 's documentary The September Issue , which followed Wintour and other Vogue editors as they prepared the issue for that month of 2007 . Writing in The Ringer on the tenth anniversary , Alison Herman observed that " The Devil Wears Prada transformed Wintour 's image from that of a mere public figure into that of a cultural icon . " Once known primarily as a fashion editor , she was now " every overlord you 'd ever bitched about three drinks deep at happy hour , only to dutifully fetch her coffee the next day . " Ultimately , the film had effected a positive change in Wintour 's image , Herman argued , " from a tyrant in chinchilla to an idol for the post @-@ Sandberg age . " 
 = = Possible sequel = = 
 In 2013 Weisberger wrote a sequel , Revenge Wears Prada . However it does not seem likely that a film version of it , or any sequel , will be made , as the film 's two stars are not eager to do so . Streep , who has never made a sequel to any of her films , has reportedly said that she is not interested in making this one in particular . And while Hathaway admits she 'd be interested in working with the same people , it would have to be " something totally different . " The Devil Wears Prada , she told Variety " might have just hit the right note . It 's good to leave it as it is . "

 = HIV / AIDS = 
 Human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immune deficiency syndrome ( HIV / AIDS ) is a spectrum of conditions caused by infection with the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . Following initial infection , a person may not notice any symptoms or may experience a brief period of influenza @-@ like illness . Typically , this is followed by a prolonged period with no symptoms . As the infection progresses , it interferes more with the immune system , increasing the risk of common infections like tuberculosis , as well as other opportunistic infections , and tumors that rarely affect people who have working immune systems . These late symptoms of infection are referred to as AIDS . This stage is often also associated with weight loss . 
 HIV is spread primarily by unprotected sex ( including anal and oral sex ) , contaminated blood transfusions , hypodermic needles , and from mother to child during pregnancy , delivery , or breastfeeding . Some bodily fluids , such as saliva and tears , do not transmit HIV . Methods of prevention include safe sex , needle exchange programmes , treating those who are infected , and male circumcision . Disease in a baby can often be prevented by giving both the mother and child antiretroviral medication . There is no cure or vaccine ; however , antiretroviral treatment can slow the course of the disease and may lead to a near @-@ normal life expectancy . Treatment is recommended as soon as the diagnosis is made . Without treatment , the average survival time after infection is 11 years . 
 In 2014 about 36 @.@ 9 million people were living with HIV and it resulted in 1 @.@ 2 million deaths . Most of those infected live in sub @-@ Saharan Africa . Between its discovery and 2014 AIDS has caused an estimated 39 million deaths worldwide . HIV / AIDS is considered a pandemic — a disease outbreak which is present over a large area and is actively spreading . HIV is believed to have originated in west @-@ central Africa during the late 19th or early 20th century . AIDS was first recognized by the United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) in 1981 and its cause — HIV infection — was identified in the early part of the decade . 
 HIV / AIDS has had a great impact on society , both as an illness and as a source of discrimination . The disease also has large economic impacts . There are many misconceptions about HIV / AIDS such as the belief that it can be transmitted by casual non @-@ sexual contact . The disease has become subject to many controversies involving religion including the Catholic church 's decision not to support condom use as prevention . It has attracted international medical and political attention as well as large @-@ scale funding since it was identified in the 1980s . 
 = = Signs and symptoms = = 
 There are three main stages of HIV infection : acute infection , clinical latency and AIDS . 
 = = = Acute infection = = = 
 The initial period following the contraction of HIV is called acute HIV , primary HIV or acute retroviral syndrome . Many individuals develop an influenza @-@ like illness or a mononucleosis @-@ like illness 2 – 4 weeks post exposure while others have no significant symptoms . Symptoms occur in 40 – 90 % of cases and most commonly include fever , large tender lymph nodes , throat inflammation , a rash , headache , and / or sores of the mouth and genitals . The rash , which occurs in 20 – 50 % of cases , presents itself on the trunk and is maculopapular , classically . Some people also develop opportunistic infections at this stage . Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea , vomiting or diarrhea may occur , as may neurological symptoms of peripheral neuropathy or Guillain @-@ Barre syndrome . The duration of the symptoms varies , but is usually one or two weeks . 
 Due to their nonspecific character , these symptoms are not often recognized as signs of HIV infection . Even cases that do get seen by a family doctor or a hospital are often misdiagnosed as one of the many common infectious diseases with overlapping symptoms . Thus , it is recommended that HIV be considered in people presenting an unexplained fever who may have risk factors for the infection . 
 = = = Clinical latency = = = 
 The initial symptoms are followed by a stage called clinical latency , asymptomatic HIV , or chronic HIV . Without treatment , this second stage of the natural history of HIV infection can last from about three years to over 20 years ( on average , about eight years ) . While typically there are few or no symptoms at first , near the end of this stage many people experience fever , weight loss , gastrointestinal problems and muscle pains . Between 50 and 70 % of people also develop persistent generalized lymphadenopathy , characterized by unexplained , non @-@ painful enlargement of more than one group of lymph nodes ( other than in the groin ) for over three to six months . 
 Although most HIV @-@ 1 infected individuals have a detectable viral load and in the absence of treatment will eventually progress to AIDS , a small proportion ( about 5 % ) retain high levels of CD4 + T cells ( T helper cells ) without antiretroviral therapy for more than 5 years . These individuals are classified as HIV controllers or long @-@ term <unk> ( <unk> ) . Another group consists of those who maintain a low or undetectable viral load without anti @-@ retroviral treatment , known as " elite controllers " or " elite suppressors " . They represent approximately 1 in 300 infected persons . 
 = = = Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome = = = 
 Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) is defined in terms of either a CD4 + T cell count below 200 cells per µL or the occurrence of specific diseases in association with an HIV infection . In the absence of specific treatment , around half of people infected with HIV develop AIDS within ten years . The most common initial conditions that alert to the presence of AIDS are pneumocystis pneumonia ( 40 % ) , cachexia in the form of HIV wasting syndrome ( 20 % ) , and esophageal candidiasis . Other common signs include recurring respiratory tract infections . 
 Opportunistic infections may be caused by bacteria , viruses , fungi , and parasites that are normally controlled by the immune system . Which infections occur depends partly on what organisms are common in the person 's environment . These infections may affect nearly every organ system . 
 People with AIDS have an increased risk of developing various viral @-@ induced cancers , including Kaposi 's sarcoma , Burkitt 's lymphoma , primary central nervous system lymphoma , and cervical cancer . Kaposi 's sarcoma is the most common cancer occurring in 10 to 20 % of people with HIV . The second most common cancer is lymphoma , which is the cause of death of nearly 16 % of people with AIDS and is the initial sign of AIDS in 3 to 4 % . Both these cancers are associated with human herpesvirus 8 . Cervical cancer occurs more frequently in those with AIDS because of its association with human papillomavirus ( HPV ) . <unk> cancer ( of the layer that lines the inner part of eyelids and the white part of the eye ) is also more common in those with HIV . 
 Additionally , people with AIDS frequently have systemic symptoms such as prolonged fevers , sweats ( particularly at night ) , swollen lymph nodes , chills , weakness , and unintended weight loss . Diarrhea is another common symptom , present in about 90 % of people with AIDS . They can also be affected by diverse psychiatric and neurological symptoms independent of opportunistic infections and cancers . 
 = = Transmission = = 
 HIV is transmitted by three main routes : sexual contact , significant exposure to infected body fluids or tissues , and from mother to child during pregnancy , delivery , or breastfeeding ( known as vertical transmission ) . There is no risk of acquiring HIV if exposed to feces , nasal secretions , saliva , sputum , sweat , tears , urine , or vomit unless these are contaminated with blood . It is possible to be co @-@ infected by more than one strain of HIV — a condition known as HIV <unk> . 
 = = = Sexual = = = 
 The most frequent mode of transmission of HIV is through sexual contact with an infected person . The majority of all transmissions worldwide occur through heterosexual contacts ( i.e. sexual contacts between people of the opposite sex ) ; however , the pattern of transmission varies significantly among countries . In the United States , as of 2010 , most transmission occurred in men who had sex with men , with this population accounting for 65 % of all new cases . 
 With regard to unprotected heterosexual contacts , estimates of the risk of HIV transmission per sexual act appear to be four to ten times higher in low @-@ income countries than in high @-@ income countries . In low @-@ income countries , the risk of female @-@ to @-@ male transmission is estimated as 0 @.@ 38 % per act , and of male @-@ to @-@ female transmission as 0 @.@ 30 % per act ; the equivalent estimates for high @-@ income countries are 0 @.@ 04 % per act for female @-@ to @-@ male transmission , and 0 @.@ 08 % per act for male @-@ to @-@ female transmission . The risk of transmission from anal intercourse is especially high , estimated as 1 @.@ 4 – 1 @.@ 7 % per act in both heterosexual and homosexual contacts . While the risk of transmission from oral sex is relatively low , it is still present . The risk from receiving oral sex has been described as " nearly nil " ; however , a few cases have been reported . The per @-@ act risk is estimated at 0 – 0 @.@ 04 % for receptive oral intercourse . In settings involving prostitution in low income countries , risk of female @-@ to @-@ male transmission has been estimated as 2 @.@ 4 % per act and male @-@ to @-@ female transmission as 0 @.@ 05 % per act . 
 Risk of transmission increases in the presence of many sexually transmitted infections and genital ulcers . Genital ulcers appear to increase the risk approximately fivefold . Other sexually transmitted infections , such as gonorrhea , chlamydia , trichomoniasis , and bacterial vaginosis , are associated with somewhat smaller increases in risk of transmission . 
 The viral load of an infected person is an important risk factor in both sexual and mother @-@ to @-@ child transmission . During the first 2 @.@ 5 months of an HIV infection a person 's infectiousness is twelve times higher due to this high viral load . If the person is in the late stages of infection , rates of transmission are approximately eightfold greater . 
 Commercial sex workers ( including those in pornography ) have an increased rate of HIV . Rough sex can be a factor associated with an increased risk of transmission . Sexual assault is also believed to carry an increased risk of HIV transmission as condoms are rarely worn , physical trauma to the vagina or rectum is likely , and there may be a greater risk of concurrent sexually transmitted infections . 
 = = = Body fluids = = = 
 The second most frequent mode of HIV transmission is via blood and blood products . Blood @-@ borne transmission can be through needle @-@ sharing during intravenous drug use , needle stick injury , transfusion of contaminated blood or blood product , or medical injections with <unk> equipment . The risk from sharing a needle during drug injection is between 0 @.@ 63 and 2 @.@ 4 % per act , with an average of 0 @.@ 8 % . The risk of acquiring HIV from a needle stick from an HIV @-@ infected person is estimated as 0 @.@ 3 % ( about 1 in 333 ) per act and the risk following mucous membrane exposure to infected blood as 0 @.@ 09 % ( about 1 in 1000 ) per act . In the United States intravenous drug users made up 12 % of all new cases of HIV in 2009 , and in some areas more than 80 % of people who inject drugs are HIV positive . 
 HIV is transmitted in about 93 % of blood transfusions using infected blood . In developed countries the risk of acquiring HIV from a blood transfusion is extremely low ( less than one in half a million ) where improved donor selection and HIV screening is performed ; for example , in the UK the risk is reported at one in five million and in the United States it was one in 1 @.@ 5 million in 2008 . In low income countries , only half of transfusions may be appropriately screened ( as of 2008 ) , and it is estimated that up to 15 % of HIV infections in these areas come from transfusion of infected blood and blood products , representing between 5 % and 10 % of global infections . Although rare because of screening , it is possible to acquire HIV from organ and tissue transplantation . 
 Unsafe medical injections play a significant role in HIV spread in sub @-@ Saharan Africa . In 2007 , between 12 and 17 % of infections in this region were attributed to medical syringe use . The World Health Organization estimates the risk of transmission as a result of a medical injection in Africa at 1 @.@ 2 % . Significant risks are also associated with invasive procedures , assisted delivery , and dental care in this area of the world . 
 People giving or receiving tattoos , piercings , and scarification are theoretically at risk of infection but no confirmed cases have been documented . It is not possible for mosquitoes or other insects to transmit HIV . 
 = = = Mother @-@ to @-@ child = = = 
 HIV can be transmitted from mother to child during pregnancy , during delivery , or through breast milk resulting in infection in the baby . This is the third most common way in which HIV is transmitted globally . In the absence of treatment , the risk of transmission before or during birth is around 20 % and in those who also breastfeed 35 % . As of 2008 , vertical transmission accounted for about 90 % of cases of HIV in children . With appropriate treatment the risk of mother @-@ to @-@ child infection can be reduced to about 1 % . Preventive treatment involves the mother taking antiretrovirals during pregnancy and delivery , an elective caesarean section , avoiding breastfeeding , and administering antiretroviral drugs to the newborn . <unk> when taken by either the mother or the infant decrease the risk of transmission in those who do breastfeed . Many of these measures are however not available in the developing world . If blood contaminates food during pre @-@ chewing it may pose a risk of transmission . 
 = = Virology = = 
 HIV is the cause of the spectrum of disease known as HIV / AIDS . HIV is a retrovirus that primarily infects components of the human immune system such as CD4 + T cells , macrophages and dendritic cells . It directly and indirectly destroys CD4 + T cells . 
 HIV is a member of the genus <unk> , part of the family Retroviridae . Lentiviruses share many morphological and biological characteristics . Many species of mammals are infected by lentiviruses , which are characteristically responsible for long @-@ duration illnesses with a long incubation period . Lentiviruses are transmitted as single @-@ stranded , positive @-@ sense , enveloped RNA viruses . Upon entry into the target cell , the viral RNA genome is converted ( reverse transcribed ) into double @-@ stranded DNA by a virally encoded reverse transcriptase that is transported along with the viral genome in the virus particle . The resulting viral DNA is then imported into the cell nucleus and integrated into the cellular DNA by a virally encoded integrase and host co @-@ factors . Once integrated , the virus may become latent , allowing the virus and its host cell to avoid detection by the immune system . Alternatively , the virus may be transcribed , producing new RNA genomes and viral proteins that are packaged and released from the cell as new virus particles that begin the replication cycle anew . 
 HIV is now known to spread between CD4 + T cells by two parallel routes : cell @-@ free spread and cell @-@ to @-@ cell spread , i.e. it employs hybrid spreading mechanisms . In the cell @-@ free spread , virus particles bud from an infected T cell , enter the blood / extracellular fluid and then infect another T cell following a chance encounter . HIV can also disseminate by direct transmission from one cell to another by a process of cell @-@ to @-@ cell spread . The hybrid spreading mechanisms of HIV contribute to the virus 's ongoing replication against antiretroviral therapies . 
 Two types of HIV have been characterized : HIV @-@ 1 and HIV @-@ 2 . HIV @-@ 1 is the virus that was originally discovered ( and initially referred to also as LAV or HTLV @-@ III ) . It is more virulent , more infective , and is the cause of the majority of HIV infections globally . The lower infectivity of HIV @-@ 2 as compared with HIV @-@ 1 implies that fewer people exposed to HIV @-@ 2 will be infected per exposure . Because of its relatively poor capacity for transmission , HIV @-@ 2 is largely confined to West Africa . 
 = = Pathophysiology = = 
 After the virus enters the body there is a period of rapid viral replication , leading to an abundance of virus in the peripheral blood . During primary infection , the level of HIV may reach several million virus particles per milliliter of blood . This response is accompanied by a marked drop in the number of circulating CD4 + T cells . The acute viremia is almost invariably associated with activation of CD8 + T cells , which kill HIV @-@ infected cells , and subsequently with antibody production , or seroconversion . The CD8 + T cell response is thought to be important in controlling virus levels , which peak and then decline , as the CD4 + T cell counts recover . A good CD8 + T cell response has been linked to slower disease progression and a better prognosis , though it does not eliminate the virus . 
 Ultimately , HIV causes AIDS by depleting CD4 + T cells . This weakens the immune system and allows opportunistic infections . T cells are essential to the immune response and without them , the body cannot fight infections or kill cancerous cells . The mechanism of CD4 + T cell depletion differs in the acute and chronic phases . During the acute phase , HIV @-@ induced cell lysis and killing of infected cells by cytotoxic T cells accounts for CD4 + T cell depletion , although apoptosis may also be a factor . During the chronic phase , the consequences of generalized immune activation coupled with the gradual loss of the ability of the immune system to generate new T cells appear to account for the slow decline in CD4 + T cell numbers . 
 Although the symptoms of immune deficiency characteristic of AIDS do not appear for years after a person is infected , the bulk of CD4 + T cell loss occurs during the first weeks of infection , especially in the intestinal mucosa , which harbors the majority of the lymphocytes found in the body . The reason for the preferential loss of mucosal CD4 + T cells is that the majority of mucosal CD4 + T cells express the CCR5 protein which HIV uses as a co @-@ receptor to gain access to the cells , whereas only a small fraction of CD4 + T cells in the bloodstream do so . A specific genetic change that alters the CCR5 protein when present in both chromosomes very effectively prevents HIV @-@ 1 infection . 
 HIV seeks out and destroys CCR5 expressing CD4 + T cells during acute infection . A vigorous immune response eventually controls the infection and initiates the clinically latent phase . CD4 + T cells in mucosal tissues remain particularly affected . Continuous HIV replication causes a state of generalized immune activation persisting throughout the chronic phase . Immune activation , which is reflected by the increased activation state of immune cells and release of pro @-@ inflammatory cytokines , results from the activity of several HIV gene products and the immune response to ongoing HIV replication . It is also linked to the breakdown of the immune surveillance system of the gastrointestinal mucosal barrier caused by the depletion of mucosal CD4 + T cells during the acute phase of disease . 
 = = Diagnosis = = 
 HIV / AIDS is diagnosed via laboratory testing and then staged based on the presence of certain signs or symptoms . HIV screening is recommended by the United States Preventive Services Task Force for all people 15 years to 65 years of age including all pregnant women . Additionally , testing is recommended for those at high risk , which includes anyone diagnosed with a sexually transmitted illness . In many areas of the world , a third of HIV carriers only discover they are infected at an advanced stage of the disease when AIDS or severe immunodeficiency has become apparent . 
 = = = HIV testing = = = 
 Most people infected with HIV develop specific antibodies ( i.e. <unk> ) within three to twelve weeks of the initial infection . Diagnosis of primary HIV before seroconversion is done by measuring HIV @-@ RNA or p24 antigen . Positive results obtained by antibody or PCR testing are confirmed either by a different antibody or by PCR . 
 Antibody tests in children younger than 18 months are typically inaccurate due to the continued presence of maternal antibodies . Thus HIV infection can only be diagnosed by PCR testing for HIV RNA or DNA , or via testing for the p24 antigen . Much of the world lacks access to reliable PCR testing and many places simply wait until either symptoms develop or the child is old enough for accurate antibody testing . In sub @-@ Saharan Africa as of 2007 – 2009 between 30 and 70 % of the population were aware of their HIV status . In 2009 , between 3 @.@ 6 and 42 % of men and women in Sub @-@ Saharan countries were tested which represented a significant increase compared to previous years . 
 = = = Classifications = = = 
 Two main clinical staging systems are used to classify HIV and HIV @-@ related disease for surveillance purposes : the WHO disease staging system for HIV infection and disease , and the CDC classification system for HIV infection . The CDC 's classification system is more frequently adopted in developed countries . Since the WHO 's staging system does not require laboratory tests , it is suited to the resource @-@ restricted conditions encountered in developing countries , where it can also be used to help guide clinical management . Despite their differences , the two systems allow comparison for statistical purposes . 
 The World Health Organization first proposed a definition for AIDS in 1986 . Since then , the WHO classification has been updated and expanded several times , with the most recent version being published in 2007 . The WHO system uses the following categories : 
 Primary HIV infection : May be either asymptomatic or associated with acute retroviral syndrome . 
 Stage I : HIV infection is asymptomatic with a CD4 + T cell count ( also known as CD4 count ) greater than 500 per microlitre ( µl or cubic mm ) of blood . May include generalized lymph node enlargement . 
 Stage II : Mild symptoms which may include minor <unk> manifestations and recurrent upper respiratory tract infections . A CD4 count of less than 500 / µl . 
 Stage III : Advanced symptoms which may include unexplained chronic diarrhea for longer than a month , severe bacterial infections including tuberculosis of the lung , and a CD4 count of less than 350 / µl . 
 Stage IV or AIDS : severe symptoms which include toxoplasmosis of the brain , candidiasis of the esophagus , trachea , bronchi or lungs and Kaposi 's sarcoma . A CD4 count of less than 200 / µl . 
 The United States Center for Disease Control and Prevention also created a classification system for HIV , and updated it in 2008 and 2014 . This system classifies HIV infections based on CD4 count and clinical symptoms , and describes the infection in five groups . In those greater than six years of age it is : 
 Stage 0 : the time between a negative or indeterminate HIV test followed less than 180 days by a positive test 
 Stage 1 : CD4 count ≥ 500 cells / µl and no AIDS defining conditions 
 Stage 2 : CD4 count 200 to 500 cells / µl and no AIDS defining conditions 
 Stage 3 : CD4 count ≤ 200 cells / µl or AIDS defining conditions 
 Unknown : if insufficient information is available to make any of the above classifications 
 For surveillance purposes , the AIDS diagnosis still stands even if , after treatment , the CD4 + T cell count rises to above 200 per µL of blood or other AIDS @-@ defining illnesses are cured . 
 = = Prevention = = 
 = = = Sexual contact = = = 
 Consistent condom use reduces the risk of HIV transmission by approximately 80 % over the long term . When condoms are used consistently by a couple in which one person is infected , the rate of HIV infection is less than 1 % per year . There is some evidence to suggest that female condoms may provide an equivalent level of protection . Application of a vaginal gel containing tenofovir ( a reverse transcriptase inhibitor ) immediately before sex seems to reduce infection rates by approximately 40 % among African women . By contrast , use of the spermicide nonoxynol @-@ 9 may increase the risk of transmission due to its tendency to cause vaginal and rectal irritation . 
 Circumcision in Sub @-@ Saharan Africa " reduces the acquisition of HIV by heterosexual men by between 38 % and 66 % over 24 months " . Due to these studies , both the World Health Organization and UNAIDS recommended male circumcision as a method of preventing female @-@ to @-@ male HIV transmission in 2007 in areas with a high rates of HIV . However , whether it protects against male @-@ to @-@ female transmission is disputed , and whether it is of benefit in developed countries and among men who have sex with men is undetermined . The International Antiviral Society , however , does recommend for all sexually active heterosexual males and that it be discussed as an option with men who have sex with men . Some experts fear that a lower perception of vulnerability among circumcised men may cause more sexual risk @-@ taking behavior , thus negating its preventive effects . 
 Programs encouraging sexual abstinence do not appear to affect subsequent HIV risk . Evidence of any benefit from peer education is equally poor . Comprehensive sexual education provided at school may decrease high risk behavior . A substantial minority of young people continues to engage in high @-@ risk practices despite knowing about HIV / AIDS , underestimating their own risk of becoming infected with HIV . Voluntary counseling and testing people for HIV does not affect risky behavior in those who test negative but does increase condom use in those who test positive . It is not known whether treating other sexually transmitted infections is effective in preventing HIV . 
 = = = Pre @-@ exposure = = = 
 <unk> treatment among people with HIV whose CD4 count ≤ 550 cells / µL is a very effective way to prevent HIV infection of their partner ( a strategy known as treatment as prevention , or <unk> ) . <unk> is associated with a 10 to 20 fold reduction in transmission risk . Pre @-@ exposure prophylaxis ( <unk> ) with a daily dose of the medications tenofovir , with or without emtricitabine , is effective in a number of groups including men who have sex with men , couples where one is HIV positive , and young heterosexuals in Africa . It may also be effective in intravenous drug users with a study finding a decrease in risk of 0 @.@ 7 to 0 @.@ 4 per 100 person years . 
 Universal precautions within the health care environment are believed to be effective in decreasing the risk of HIV . Intravenous drug use is an important risk factor and harm reduction strategies such as needle @-@ exchange programs and opioid substitution therapy appear effective in decreasing this risk . 
 = = = Post @-@ exposure = = = 
 A course of antiretrovirals administered within 48 to 72 hours after exposure to HIV @-@ positive blood or genital secretions is referred to as post @-@ exposure prophylaxis ( PEP ) . The use of the single agent zidovudine reduces the risk of a HIV infection five @-@ fold following a needle @-@ stick injury . As of 2013 , the prevention regimen recommended in the United States consists of three medications — tenofovir , emtricitabine and <unk> — as this may reduce the risk further . 
 PEP treatment is recommended after a sexual assault when the perpetrator is known to be HIV positive , but is controversial when their HIV status is unknown . The duration of treatment is usually four weeks and is frequently associated with adverse effects — where zidovudine is used , about 70 % of cases result in adverse effects such as nausea ( 24 % ) , fatigue ( 22 % ) , emotional distress ( 13 % ) and headaches ( 9 % ) . 
 = = = Mother @-@ to @-@ child = = = 
 Programs to prevent the vertical transmission of HIV ( from mothers to children ) can reduce rates of transmission by 92 – 99 % . This primarily involves the use of a combination of antiviral medications during pregnancy and after birth in the infant and potentially includes bottle feeding rather than breastfeeding . If replacement feeding is acceptable , feasible , affordable , sustainable , and safe , mothers should avoid breastfeeding their infants ; however exclusive breastfeeding is recommended during the first months of life if this is not the case . If exclusive breastfeeding is carried out , the provision of extended antiretroviral prophylaxis to the infant decreases the risk of transmission . In 2015 , Cuba became the first country in the world to eradicate mother @-@ to @-@ child transmission of HIV . 
 = = = Vaccination = = = 
 Currently , there is no licensed vaccine for HIV or AIDS . The most effective vaccine trial to date , RV 144 , was published in 2009 and found a partial reduction in the risk of transmission of roughly 30 % , stimulating some hope in the research community of developing a truly effective vaccine . Further trials of the RV 144 vaccine are ongoing . 
 = = Treatment = = 
 There is currently no cure or effective HIV vaccine . Treatment consists of highly active antiretroviral therapy ( HAART ) which slows progression of the disease . As of 2010 more than 6 @.@ 6 million people were taking them in low and middle income countries . Treatment also includes preventive and active treatment of opportunistic infections . 
 = = = Antiviral therapy = = = 
 Current HAART options are combinations ( or " cocktails " ) consisting of at least three medications belonging to at least two types , or " classes , " of antiretroviral agents . Initially treatment is typically a non @-@ nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor ( <unk> ) plus two nucleoside analogue reverse transcriptase inhibitors ( <unk> ) . Typical <unk> include : zidovudine ( AZT ) or tenofovir ( <unk> ) and lamivudine ( <unk> ) or emtricitabine ( FTC ) . Combinations of agents which include protease inhibitors ( PI ) are used if the above regimen loses effectiveness . 
 The World Health Organization and United States recommends antiretrovirals in people of all ages including pregnant women as soon as the diagnosis is made regardless of CD4 count . Once treatment is begun it is recommended that it is continued without breaks or " holidays " . Many people are diagnosed only after treatment ideally should have begun . The desired outcome of treatment is a long term plasma HIV @-@ RNA count below 50 copies / mL . Levels to determine if treatment is effective are initially recommended after four weeks and once levels fall below 50 copies / mL checks every three to six months are typically adequate . Inadequate control is deemed to be greater than 400 copies / mL . Based on these criteria treatment is effective in more than 95 % of people during the first year . 
 Benefits of treatment include a decreased risk of progression to AIDS and a decreased risk of death . In the developing world treatment also improves physical and mental health . With treatment there is a 70 % reduced risk of acquiring tuberculosis . Additional benefits include a decreased risk of transmission of the disease to sexual partners and a decrease in mother @-@ to @-@ child transmission . The effectiveness of treatment depends to a large part on compliance . Reasons for non @-@ adherence include poor access to medical care , inadequate social supports , mental illness and drug abuse . The complexity of treatment regimens ( due to pill numbers and dosing frequency ) and adverse effects may reduce adherence . Even though cost is an important issue with some medications , 47 % of those who needed them were taking them in low and middle income countries as of 2010 and the rate of adherence is similar in low @-@ income and high @-@ income countries . 
 Specific adverse events are related to the antiretroviral agent taken . Some relatively common adverse events include : <unk> syndrome , <unk> , and diabetes mellitus , especially with protease inhibitors . Other common symptoms include diarrhea , and an increased risk of cardiovascular disease . Newer recommended treatments are associated with fewer adverse effects . Certain medications may be associated with birth defects and therefore may be unsuitable for women hoping to have children . 
 Treatment recommendations for children are somewhat different from those for adults . The World Health Organisation recommends treating all children less than 5 years of age ; children above 5 are treated like adults . The United States guidelines recommend treating all children less than 12 months of age and all those with HIV RNA counts greater than 100 @,@ 000 copies / mL between one year and five years of age . 
 = = = Opportunistic infections = = = 
 Measures to prevent opportunistic infections are effective in many people with HIV / AIDS . In addition to improving current disease , treatment with antiretrovirals reduces the risk of developing additional opportunistic infections . Adults and adolescents who are living with HIV ( even on anti @-@ retroviral therapy ) with no evidence of active tuberculosis in settings with high tuberculosis burden should receive isoniazid preventive therapy ( IPT ) , the tuberculin skin test can be used to help decide if IPT is needed . Vaccination against hepatitis A and B is advised for all people at risk of HIV before they become infected ; however it may also be given after infection . <unk> / <unk> prophylaxis between four and six weeks of age and ceasing breastfeeding in infants born to HIV positive mothers is recommended in resource limited settings . It is also recommended to prevent PCP when a person 's CD4 count is below 200 cells / <unk> and in those who have or have previously had PCP . People with substantial immunosuppression are also advised to receive prophylactic therapy for toxoplasmosis and Cryptococcus meningitis . Appropriate preventive measures have reduced the rate of these infections by 50 % between 1992 and 1997 . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 The World Health Organization ( WHO ) has issued recommendations regarding nutrient requirements in HIV / AIDS . A generally healthy diet is promoted . Some evidence has shown a benefit from micronutrient supplements . Evidence for supplementation with selenium is mixed with some tentative evidence of benefit . There is some evidence that vitamin A supplementation in children reduces mortality and improves growth . In Africa in nutritionally compromised pregnant and lactating women a multivitamin supplementation has improved outcomes for both mothers and children . Dietary intake of micronutrients at RDA levels by HIV @-@ infected adults is recommended by the WHO ; higher intake of vitamin A , zinc , and iron can produce adverse effects in HIV positive adults , and is not recommended unless there is documented deficiency . 
 = = = Alternative medicine = = = 
 In the US , approximately 60 % of people with HIV use various forms of complementary or alternative medicine , even though the effectiveness of most of these therapies has not been established . There is not enough evidence to support the use of herbal medicines . There is insufficient evidence to recommend or support the use of medical cannabis to try to increase appetite or weight gain . 
 = = Prognosis = = 
 HIV / AIDS has become a chronic rather than an acutely fatal disease in many areas of the world . Prognosis varies between people , and both the CD4 count and viral load are useful for predicted outcomes . Without treatment , average survival time after infection with HIV is estimated to be 9 to 11 years , depending on the HIV subtype . After the diagnosis of AIDS , if treatment is not available , survival ranges between 6 and 19 months . HAART and appropriate prevention of opportunistic infections reduces the death rate by 80 % , and raises the life expectancy for a newly diagnosed young adult to 20 – 50 years . This is between two thirds and nearly that of the general population . If treatment is started late in the infection , prognosis is not as good : for example , if treatment is begun following the diagnosis of AIDS , life expectancy is ~ 10 – 40 years . Half of infants born with HIV die before two years of age without treatment . 
 The primary causes of death from HIV / AIDS are opportunistic infections and cancer , both of which are frequently the result of the progressive failure of the immune system . Risk of cancer appears to increase once the CD4 count is below 500 / <unk> . The rate of clinical disease progression varies widely between individuals and has been shown to be affected by a number of factors such as a person 's susceptibility and immune function ; their access to health care , the presence of co @-@ infections ; and the particular strain ( or strains ) of the virus involved . 
 Tuberculosis co @-@ infection is one of the leading causes of sickness and death in those with HIV / AIDS being present in a third of all HIV @-@ infected people and causing 25 % of HIV @-@ related deaths . HIV is also one of the most important risk factors for tuberculosis . Hepatitis C is another very common co @-@ infection where each disease increases the progression of the other . The two most common cancers associated with HIV / AIDS are Kaposi 's sarcoma and AIDS @-@ related non @-@ Hodgkin 's lymphoma . 
 Even with anti @-@ retroviral treatment , over the long term HIV @-@ infected people may experience neurocognitive disorders , osteoporosis , neuropathy , cancers , nephropathy , and cardiovascular disease . Some conditions like <unk> may be caused both by HIV and its treatment . 
 = = Epidemiology = = 
 HIV / AIDS is a global pandemic . As of 2014 , approximately 37 million people have HIV worldwide with the number of new infections that year being about 2 million . This is down from 3 @.@ 1 million new infections in 2001 . Of these 37 million more than half are women and 2 @.@ 6 million are less than 15 years old . It resulted in about 1 @.@ 2 million deaths in 2014 , down from a peak of 2 @.@ 2 million in 2005 . 
 Sub @-@ Saharan Africa is the region most affected . In 2010 , an estimated 68 % ( 22 @.@ 9 million ) of all HIV cases and 66 % of all deaths ( 1 @.@ 2 million ) occurred in this region . This means that about 5 % of the adult population is infected and it is believed to be the cause of 10 % of all deaths in children . Here in contrast to other regions women compose nearly 60 % of cases . South Africa has the largest population of people with HIV of any country in the world at 5 @.@ 9 million . Life expectancy has fallen in the worst @-@ affected countries due to HIV / AIDS ; for example , in 2006 it was estimated that it had dropped from 65 to 35 years in Botswana . Mother @-@ to @-@ child transmission , as of 2013 , in Botswana and South Africa has decreased to less than 5 % with improvement in many other African nations due to improved access to antiretroviral therapy . 
 South & South East Asia is the second most affected ; in 2010 this region contained an estimated 4 million cases or 12 % of all people living with HIV resulting in approximately 250 @,@ 000 deaths . Approximately 2 @.@ 4 million of these cases are in India . 
 In 2008 in the United States approximately 1 @.@ 2 million people were living with HIV , resulting in about 17 @,@ 500 deaths . The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimated that in 2008 20 % of infected Americans were unaware of their infection . In the United Kingdom as of 2009 there were approximately 86 @,@ 500 cases which resulted in 516 deaths . In Canada as of 2008 there were about 65 @,@ 000 cases causing 53 deaths . Between the first recognition of AIDS in 1981 and 2009 it has led to nearly 30 million deaths . Prevalence is lowest in Middle East and North Africa at 0 @.@ 1 % or less , East Asia at 0 @.@ 1 % and Western and Central Europe at 0 @.@ 2 % . The worst affected European countries , in 2009 and 2012 estimates , are Russia , Ukraine , Latvia , Moldova , Portugal and Belarus , in decreasing order of prevalence . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Discovery = = = 
 AIDS was first clinically observed in 1981 in the United States . The initial cases were a cluster of injecting drug users and homosexual men with no known cause of impaired immunity who showed symptoms of Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia ( PCP ) , a rare opportunistic infection that was known to occur in people with very compromised immune systems . Soon thereafter , an unexpected number of homosexual men developed a previously rare skin cancer called Kaposi 's sarcoma ( KS ) . Many more cases of PCP and KS emerged , alerting U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) and a CDC task force was formed to monitor the outbreak . 
 In the early days , the CDC did not have an official name for the disease , often referring to it by way of the diseases that were associated with it , for example , lymphadenopathy , the disease after which the discoverers of HIV originally named the virus . They also used Kaposi 's sarcoma and opportunistic infections , the name by which a task force had been set up in 1981 . At one point , the CDC coined the phrase " the 4H disease " , since the syndrome seemed to affect heroin users , homosexuals , hemophiliacs , and Haitians . In the general press , the term " GRID " , which stood for gay @-@ related immune deficiency , had been coined . However , after determining that AIDS was not isolated to the gay community , it was realized that the term GRID was misleading and the term AIDS was introduced at a meeting in July 1982 . By September 1982 the CDC started referring to the disease as AIDS . 
 In 1983 , two separate research groups led by Robert Gallo and Luc Montagnier declared that a novel retrovirus may have been infecting people with AIDS , and published their findings in the same issue of the journal Science . Gallo claimed that a virus his group had isolated from a person with AIDS was strikingly similar in shape to other human T @-@ lymphotropic viruses ( <unk> ) his group had been the first to isolate . Gallo 's group called their newly isolated virus HTLV @-@ III . At the same time , Montagnier 's group isolated a virus from a person presenting with swelling of the lymph nodes of the neck and physical weakness , two characteristic symptoms of AIDS . Contradicting the report from Gallo 's group , Montagnier and his colleagues showed that core proteins of this virus were immunologically different from those of HTLV @-@ I. Montagnier 's group named their isolated virus lymphadenopathy @-@ associated virus ( LAV ) . As these two viruses turned out to be the same , in 1986 , LAV and HTLV @-@ III were renamed HIV . 
 = = = Origins = = = 
 Both HIV @-@ 1 and HIV @-@ 2 are believed to have originated in non @-@ human primates in West @-@ central Africa and were transferred to humans in the early 20th century . HIV @-@ 1 appears to have originated in southern Cameroon through the evolution of SIV ( cpz ) , a simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) that infects wild chimpanzees ( HIV @-@ 1 descends from the SIVcpz endemic in the chimpanzee subspecies Pan troglodytes troglodytes ) . The closest relative of HIV @-@ 2 is SIV ( <unk> ) , a virus of the sooty mangabey ( Cercocebus atys atys ) , an Old World monkey living in coastal West Africa ( from southern Senegal to western Côte d 'Ivoire ) . New World monkeys such as the owl monkey are resistant to HIV @-@ 1 infection , possibly because of a genomic fusion of two viral resistance genes . HIV @-@ 1 is thought to have jumped the species barrier on at least three separate occasions , giving rise to the three groups of the virus , M , N , and O. 
 There is evidence that humans who participate in bushmeat activities , either as hunters or as bushmeat vendors , commonly acquire SIV . However , SIV is a weak virus which is typically suppressed by the human immune system within weeks of infection . It is thought that several transmissions of the virus from individual to individual in quick succession are necessary to allow it enough time to mutate into HIV . Furthermore , due to its relatively low person @-@ to @-@ person transmission rate , SIV can only spread throughout the population in the presence of one or more high @-@ risk transmission channels , which are thought to have been absent in Africa before the 20th century . 
 Specific proposed high @-@ risk transmission channels , allowing the virus to adapt to humans and spread throughout the society , depend on the proposed timing of the animal @-@ to @-@ human crossing . Genetic studies of the virus suggest that the most recent common ancestor of the HIV @-@ 1 M group dates back to circa 1910 . Proponents of this dating link the HIV epidemic with the emergence of colonialism and growth of large colonial African cities , leading to social changes , including a higher degree of sexual promiscuity , the spread of prostitution , and the accompanying high frequency of genital ulcer diseases ( such as syphilis ) in nascent colonial cities . While transmission rates of HIV during vaginal intercourse are low under regular circumstances , they are increased many fold if one of the partners suffers from a sexually transmitted infection causing genital ulcers . Early 1900s colonial cities were notable due to their high prevalence of prostitution and genital ulcers , to the degree that , as of 1928 , as many as 45 % of female residents of eastern Kinshasa were thought to have been prostitutes , and , as of 1933 , around 15 % of all residents of the same city had syphilis . 
 An alternative view holds that unsafe medical practices in Africa after World War II , such as unsterile reuse of single use syringes during mass vaccination , antibiotic and anti @-@ malaria treatment campaigns , were the initial vector that allowed the virus to adapt to humans and spread . 
 The earliest well @-@ documented case of HIV in a human dates back to 1959 in the Congo . The earliest retrospectively described case of AIDS is believed to have been in Norway beginning in 1966 . In July 1960 , in the wake its independence , the United Nations recruited Francophone experts and technicians from all over the world to assist in filling administrative gaps left by Belgium , who did not leave behind an African elite to run the country . By 1962 , Haitians made up the second largest group of well @-@ educated experts ( out of the 48 national groups recruited ) , that totaled around 4500 in the country . Dr. Jacques Pépin , a Quebecer author of The Origins of AIDS , stipulates that Haiti was one of HIV 's entry points to the United States and that one of them may have carried HIV back across the Atlantic in the 1960s . Although , the virus may have been present in the United States as early as 1966 , the vast majority of infections occurring outside sub @-@ Saharan Africa ( including the U.S. ) can be traced back to a single unknown individual who became infected with HIV in Haiti and then brought the infection to the United States some time around 1969 . The epidemic then rapidly spread among high @-@ risk groups ( initially , sexually promiscuous men who have sex with men ) . By 1978 , the prevalence of HIV @-@ 1 among homosexual male residents of New York and San Francisco was estimated at 5 % , suggesting that several thousand individuals in the country had been infected .

 = = = Stigma = = = 
 AIDS stigma exists around the world in a variety of ways , including ostracism , rejection , discrimination and avoidance of HIV infected people ; compulsory HIV testing without prior consent or protection of confidentiality ; violence against HIV infected individuals or people who are perceived to be infected with HIV ; and the quarantine of HIV infected individuals . Stigma @-@ related violence or the fear of violence prevents many people from seeking HIV testing , returning for their results , or securing treatment , possibly turning what could be a manageable chronic illness into a death sentence and perpetuating the spread of HIV . 
 AIDS stigma has been further divided into the following three categories : 
 Instrumental AIDS stigma — a reflection of the fear and apprehension that are likely to be associated with any deadly and transmissible illness . 
 Symbolic AIDS stigma — the use of HIV / AIDS to express attitudes toward the social groups or lifestyles perceived to be associated with the disease . 
 Courtesy AIDS stigma — stigmatization of people connected to the issue of HIV / AIDS or HIV @-@ positive people . 
 Often , AIDS stigma is expressed in conjunction with one or more other stigmas , particularly those associated with homosexuality , bisexuality , promiscuity , prostitution , and intravenous drug use . 
 In many developed countries , there is an association between AIDS and homosexuality or bisexuality , and this association is correlated with higher levels of sexual prejudice , such as anti @-@ homosexual / bisexual attitudes . There is also a perceived association between AIDS and all male @-@ male sexual behavior , including sex between uninfected men . However , the dominant mode of spread worldwide for HIV remains heterosexual transmission . 
 In 2003 , as part of an overall reform of marriage and population legislation , it became legal for people with AIDS to marry in China . 
 = = = Economic impact = = = 
 HIV / AIDS affects the economics of both individuals and countries . The gross domestic product of the most affected countries has decreased due to the lack of human capital . Without proper nutrition , health care and medicine , large numbers of people die from AIDS @-@ related complications . They will not only be unable to work , but will also require significant medical care . It is estimated that as of 2007 there were 12 million AIDS orphans . Many are cared for by elderly grandparents . 
 Returning to work after beginning treatment for HIV / AIDS is difficult , and affected people often work less than the average worker . Unemployment in people with HIV / AIDS also is associated with suicidal ideation , memory problems , and social isolation ; employment increases self @-@ esteem , sense of dignity , confidence , and quality of life . A 2015 Cochrane review found low @-@ quality evidence that antiretroviral treatment helps people with HIV / AIDS work more , and increases the chance that a person with HIV / AIDS will be employed . 
 By affecting mainly young adults , AIDS reduces the taxable population , in turn reducing the resources available for public expenditures such as education and health services not related to AIDS resulting in increasing pressure for the state 's finances and slower growth of the economy . This causes a slower growth of the tax base , an effect that is reinforced if there are growing expenditures on treating the sick , training ( to replace sick workers ) , sick pay and caring for AIDS orphans . This is especially true if the sharp increase in adult mortality shifts the responsibility and blame from the family to the government in caring for these orphans . 
 At the household level , AIDS causes both loss of income and increased spending on healthcare . A study in Côte d 'Ivoire showed that households having a person with HIV / AIDS spent twice as much on medical expenses as other households . This additional expenditure also leaves less income to spend on education and other personal or family investment . 
 = = = Religion and AIDS = = = 
 The topic of religion and AIDS has become highly controversial in the past twenty years , primarily because some religious authorities have publicly declared their opposition to the use of condoms . The religious approach to prevent the spread of AIDS according to a report by American health expert Matthew Hanley titled The Catholic Church and the Global AIDS Crisis argues that cultural changes are needed including a re @-@ emphasis on fidelity within marriage and sexual abstinence outside of it . 
 Some religious organisations have claimed that prayer can cure HIV / AIDS . In 2011 , the BBC reported that some churches in London were claiming that prayer would cure AIDS , and the Hackney @-@ based Centre for the Study of Sexual Health and HIV reported that several people stopped taking their medication , sometimes on the direct advice of their pastor , leading to a number of deaths . The Synagogue Church Of All Nations advertise an " anointing water " to promote God 's healing , although the group deny advising people to stop taking medication . 
 = = = Media portrayal = = = 
 One of the first high @-@ profile cases of AIDS was the American Rock Hudson , a gay actor who had been married and divorced earlier in life , who died on October 2 , 1985 having announced that he was suffering from the virus on July 25 that year . He had been diagnosed during 1984 . A notable British casualty of AIDS that year was Nicholas Eden , a gay politician and son of the late prime minister Anthony Eden . On November 24 , 1991 , the virus claimed the life of British rock star Freddie Mercury , lead singer of the band Queen , who died from an AIDS @-@ related illness having only revealed the diagnosis on the previous day . However , he had been diagnosed as HIV positive in 1987 . One of the first high @-@ profile heterosexual cases of the virus was Arthur Ashe , the American tennis player . He was diagnosed as HIV positive on August 31 , 1988 , having contracted the virus from blood transfusions during heart surgery earlier in the 1980s . Further tests within 24 hours of the initial diagnosis revealed that Ashe had AIDS , but he did not tell the public about his diagnosis until April 1992 . He died as a result on February 6 , 1993 at age 49 . 
 Therese <unk> 's photograph of gay activist David Kirby , as he lay dying from AIDS while surrounded by family , was taken in April 1990 . LIFE magazine said the photo became the one image " most powerfully identified with the HIV / AIDS epidemic . " The photo was displayed in LIFE magazine , was the winner of the World Press Photo , and acquired worldwide notoriety after being used in a United Colors of Benetton advertising campaign in 1992 . In 1996 , Johnson <unk> , a Ugandan @-@ born Canadian was diagnosed with HIV , but subsequently had unprotected sex with 11 women without disclosing his diagnosis . By 2003 seven had contracted HIV , and two died from complications related to AIDS . <unk> was convicted of first @-@ degree murder and is liable to a life sentence . 
 = = = Criminal transmission = = = 
 Criminal transmission of HIV is the intentional or reckless infection of a person with the human immunodeficiency virus ( HIV ) . Some countries or jurisdictions , including some areas of the United States , have laws that criminalize HIV transmission or exposure . Others may charge the accused under laws enacted before the HIV pandemic . 
 = = = Misconceptions = = = 
 There are many misconceptions about HIV and AIDS . Three of the most common are that AIDS can spread through casual contact , that sexual intercourse with a virgin will cure AIDS , and that HIV can infect only gay men and drug users . In 2014 , some among the British public wrongly thought you could get HIV from kissing ( 16 % ) , sharing a glass ( 5 % ) , spitting ( 16 % ) , a public toilet seat ( 4 % ) , and coughing or sneezing ( 5 % ) . Other misconceptions are that any act of anal intercourse between two uninfected gay men can lead to HIV infection , and that open discussion of HIV and homosexuality in schools will lead to increased rates of AIDS . 
 A small group of individuals continue to dispute the connection between HIV and AIDS , the existence of HIV itself , or the validity of HIV testing and treatment methods . These claims , known as AIDS denialism , have been examined and rejected by the scientific community . However , they have had a significant political impact , particularly in South Africa , where the government 's official embrace of AIDS denialism ( 1999 – 2005 ) was responsible for its ineffective response to that country 's AIDS epidemic , and has been blamed for hundreds of thousands of avoidable deaths and HIV infections . 
 Several discredited conspiracy theories have held that HIV was created by scientists , either inadvertently or deliberately . Operation <unk> was a worldwide Soviet active measures operation to spread the claim that the United States had created HIV / AIDS . Surveys show that a significant number of people believed – and continue to believe – in such claims . 
 = = Research = = 
 HIV / AIDS research includes all medical research which attempts to prevent , treat , or cure HIV / AIDS along with fundamental research about the nature of HIV as an infectious agent and AIDS as the disease caused by HIV . 
 Many governments and research institutions participate in HIV / AIDS research . This research includes behavioral health interventions such as sex education , and drug development , such as research into microbicides for sexually transmitted diseases , HIV vaccines , and antiretroviral drugs . Other medical research areas include the topics of pre @-@ exposure prophylaxis , post @-@ exposure prophylaxis , and circumcision and HIV . 
 = Encyclopedia of Chicago = 
 The Encyclopedia of Chicago is an historical reference work covering Chicago and the entire Chicago metropolitan area published by the University of Chicago Press . Released in October 2004 , the work is the result of a ten @-@ year collaboration between the Newberry Library and the Chicago Historical Society . It exists in both a hardcover print edition and an online format , known as the Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago . The print edition is 1117 pages and includes 1400 entries , 2000 biographical sketches , 250 significant business enterprise descriptions , and hundreds of maps . Initially , the internet edition included 1766 entries , 1000 more images and sources . 
 The concept was fueled by other regional encyclopedias that had met with commercial success in 1980s and 1990s . Eventually , the vision to create the book found initial financing from the National Endowment for the Humanities . The book was well received and became a bestseller during the 2004 Christmas season following its October 2004 release . The following May the Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago was released . Northwestern University joined the Newberry Library / Chicago Historical Society collaboration to publish the internet edition . The internet edition was the second of its kind for a U.S. city . 
 = = Details = = 
 Individual entries were compiled by historians , graduate assistants and authors . Most contributors were professors . About 600 people contributed entries at a rate of $ .10 / per word . The contributors consulted reliable secondary sources , such as newspapers , to compile historical accounts . The book was edited by James R. Grossman , Ann Durkin Keating , and Janice L. Reiff . At the time , Grossman was the vice president for research and education at the Newberry Library and visiting professor of history at the University of Chicago . Keating was a professor of history at North Central College . Reiff was an associate professor of history at the University of California , Los Angeles . 
 Unlike resource compilation efforts for the cities that inspired this encyclopedia , the work was not bounded by the city limits . Instead , every suburb was provided an entry , as were each of Chicago 's 77 official community areas . Entries ranged from 50 to 4000 words long . Eventually , the coverage of the subject matter expanded to include Southwest Michigan and Northwest Indiana . Newberry Library describes the work as " one of the most significant historical projects undertaken in the last twenty years " . 
 = = History = = 
 Inspired by encyclopedia compilation efforts of cities such as New York City , Indianapolis and Cleveland , Keating approached the Newberry Library in 1991 to strategize on how to best to study and teach Chicago history . Eventually she and Grossman agreed to prepare a funding request from the National Endowment for the Humanities ( NEH ) . Their initial proposal was declined , but after working with Grossman to refine the specifics of their proposal , the NEH accepted their idea . The book venture was originally announced in 1994 as a project funded by a NEH US $ 200 @,@ 000 ( $ 319 @,@ 308 today ) grant . The grant also included a $ 300 @,@ 000 challenge grant to be met by Newberry Library for the first three years of work . The original plan was to publish a hardcover book by 2001 and then to follow with what at the time was referred to vaguely as " <unk> " in reference to possible internet and CD @-@ ROM auxiliary products . After Grossman and Keating obtained the initial grant , Reiff , a computer technology expert , and encyclopedia veteran Carol J. Summerfield all became part of the team . The editors sought the advice of Chicago @-@ area librarians who were organized into focus groups to determine the proper components for the planned publication . The editors also organized into task forces of experts in dozens of specialized fields . Early on they sought the expertise of University of Chicago cartographer Michael P. Conzen , who helped develop 56 original maps . Conzen is credited as the cartographic editor . 
 By 1997 , the text had taken shape and the plan was that the average biographical entry would be 150 words . The longest biographical entries , about 450 words , were written for former Chicago Mayors Harold Washington and Richard J. Daley . Neither Richard M. Daley nor Michael Jordan had entries because only notable deceased persons were included . By 1998 , the editors had settled on the table of contents and begun the job of assigning , editing , fact @-@ checking and re @-@ editing the hundreds of entries , some of them as long as 4000 words . By March 2000 , 1100 of the targeted 1400 entries were completed . Also , the growth of the internet had clarified the vision of an online version of the print edition . In 2000 , the final volume was expected to be 1300 pages set for release in fall 2002 . The internet version was expected the following year . By June 2001 , nearly 1300 of the entries had been submitted and a third had been edited and reviewed for accuracy . The effort had become a $ 2 @.@ 5 million effort and was aspiring towards the success of earlier encyclopedic efforts projecting a fall 2003 publication of a 1 @.@ 3 @-@ million @-@ word 1300 @-@ page edition . At this time , the final electronic form available through the Chicago Historical Society had been conceptualized . 
 = = Public release = = 
 By 2001 , two editions of The Encyclopedia of Cleveland History ( 1987 ) had sold 24 @,@ 000 copies ; The Encyclopedia of Indianapolis ( 1994 ) had sold 9000 copies and The Encyclopedia of New York City ( 1995 ) had sold 70 @,@ 000 ( 50 @,@ 000 in its first year ) . Hardcover versions of these works had sold for $ 59 @.@ 95 and up . The commercial success of these other regional encyclopedias made it clear that there is a market for such products . Several university presses released regional encyclopedic publications in 2004 . In April , Rutgers University Press published The Encyclopedia of New Jersey . In September , the University of Nebraska Press published Encyclopedia of the Great Plains . In October , the University of Chicago Press released The Encyclopedia of Chicago . Additionally , Yale University Press was scheduled to publish both Encyclopedia of New England and the second edition of The Encyclopedia of New York City . 
 Using press releases from the Copley News Service , the book was widely publicized throughout the state of Illinois , and it was even reviewed by The Wall Street Journal . When first published in 2004 , the book was on the USA Today recommended Christmas gifts list . That year it was at the top of the Chicago area bestseller lists at bookstores during the Christmas holiday season . Major funding for the $ 65 list price four @-@ color print version of the publication , which cost $ 1 @.@ 7 million in the end , was provided by the NEH , the MacArthur Foundation , the City of Chicago and the State of Illinois .

 At the time of the print release , the online version , known as the Electronic Encyclopedia of Chicago , was being developed to include additional features , which relied on hyperlinks , that were not available in the print edition . At the time , it was expected to be released by the Chicago Historical Society in April 2005 . On May 11 , the Electronic edition , which cost nearly $ 1 million to create and is continuously available for free to the public , was released . It included hundreds of additional entries ( bringing the total to 1766 ) , more than 1000 additional images , video of historic figures and events , and extensive primary source material . The online version includes 1000 more sources than the print edition . The Web site includes many tables and maps that date to the 19th Century . Northwestern University media specialists developed the Web architecture for the electronic version . The electronic edition made Chicago the second major U.S. city ( following Cleveland ) with an extensive Internet encyclopedia dedicated to its history and its release was covered by newspapers throughout the Midwest . The extra features of the online edition would have required 10 @,@ 000 pages to produce in print @-@ edition format . Initially , the online edition was a static version , but updates and adjustments were planned .

 USA Today ' referred to it as a good coffee table book . Chicago Tribune journalist Rick Kogan describes this as a massive undertaking with the natural foibles of the human element in it selections and accuracy , and by nature of its attempt to serve as a historical compilation an immediately dated product due to the dynamic nature of the city . However , he feels it is sure to amaze its audience . A Chicago Sun @-@ Times reviewer describes it as a scholarly product that is " easily the most comprehensive reference book on the Chicago region ever published " . The State Journal @-@ Register , the Springfield , Illinois newspaper , reviewers complain that downstate cities and regions are neglected in the book . A Daily Herald review describes it as a book accurately " billed as the city 's most definitive historical reference book " . The Peoria Journal Star notes that although there are complaints about omissions and underserved topics , the online version should quell the demands for further knowledge . 
 The online version was noted for its " large number of tables and maps that date to the 19th Century " by the Chicago Tribune . Dubuque , Iowa 's Telegraph Herald newspaper and Indiana 's Post @-@ Tribune referenced an Associated Press press release that described the online version as a compilation assembled " with more than Chicagoans in mind " . The Chicago Tribune described the online version as an extension of " the most comprehensive reference book on the Chicago region ever published " that is unlimited by physical bounds . 
 Journal of American History along with the website History Matters : The U.S. Survey Course on the Web published a review by University of Southern California professor Philip J. <unk> that spoke glowingly about both versions of the encyclopedia describing it as " one of the finest collective works ( with 633 listed authors ) of North American historical scholarship of our era " . They praised it for its breadth and coherence . The online version was noted for its meticulous <unk> . The online review was cursory in the sense that it did not realize the expansion of the online version . However , the review notes that the online version provides " powerful and substantive " interactive resources that are not possible in the print edition . The review is especially respectful of the cartographic contributions , which it describes in detail . It dismisses the alphabetical structure of the online version as an unnecessary complication . The review also complains about biographical omissions that necessitate extensive navigation to related articles . The review felt some of the online foibles left open the possibility that the production might get overshadowed by future ventures that leverage the electronic possibilities more fully . 
 The Chronicle of Higher Education reviewed the Encyclopedia along with several of its peers and mentioned early in the review that the advent of online encyclopedias makes the works much easier to correct and update . However , the availability of online encyclopedias diminished the significance of the print editions according to the review because it made gifting them less significant and it reduced sales at libraries . The review also noted that the online approach is becoming so successful that the state of Georgia has produced the online @-@ only New Georgia Encyclopedia , which started as a 300 @-@ article venture and has blossomed to a 1300 @-@ article work . However , they noted that when the Encyclopedia of Chicago was first released that the local media supported the book ; some Chicago disc jockeys read passages from it on air . It enjoyed successful marketing as both a popular gift item and a must @-@ have for local historians .

 The encyclopedia is composed of 1117 pages that feature over 1400 entries by more than 600 contributors . Additionally , it includes 442 maps , more than 400 vintage photographs , over 250 sketches of " historically significant business enterprises " , a dictionary of Chicago @-@ area businesses , a biographical dictionary and a 21 @-@ page timeline that traces the history of Chicago from 1630 to 2000 . 
 The 1400 @-@ entry main alphabetical section of the Encyclopedia covers all Chicago neighborhoods , suburbs , and ethnic groups as well as the major cultural institutions . Topics covered include technology and science , architecture , religions , immigration , transportation , business history , labor , music , health and medicine . It is considered the most geographical diverse city encyclopedia of its kind because it fully encompasses the suburbs in eight of the region 's counties . 386 thumbnail maps of neighborhoods and municipalities are complemented by 400 black @-@ and @-@ white photographs plus hundreds of color photographs and thematic maps . There are separate lengthy interpretive essays woven into the alphabetical section on topics such as the built environment , literary images of Chicago , and the city 's sports culture . The Encyclopedia includes a 2000 @-@ entry comprehensive biographical dictionary and a detailed listing of approximately 250 of the city 's historically significant business enterprises . A color insert features a timeline of Chicago history and photo essays exploring nine pivotal years in this history . The photo essays feature the city ’ s urban art and artifacts .

At the end of the season , Kemp had the 40 steals and was only caught 11 times , a significant improvement in percentage from the previous year , and his work with Lopes was credited for much of the improvement . 
 On April 17 , Kemp hit his second career walk @-@ off home run , doing it in the ninth inning off of St. Louis Cardinals closer Ryan Franklin , on a 2 – 2 count that gave the Dodgers a 2 – 1 victory . " In a game against the Atlanta Braves five days later , Kemp hit his second walk @-@ off home run of the season , this time in the 12th inning off of Braves pitcher <unk> Martínez . 
 After being one of the league leaders in home runs , stolen bases , RBIs , and batting average during the first half of the season , Kemp was voted as a starter for the National League squad in the 2011 Major League Baseball All @-@ Star Game in Arizona . He also accepted an invitation to participate in the Home Run Derby at the All @-@ Star Game . 
 The day before the All @-@ Star Game , Giants ' manager and 2011 NL All @-@ Star Manager , Bruce Bochy , announced his decision to bat Kemp third in the line up . Explaining his decision , Bochy said about Kemp , " He 's a guy with speed , power , a guy that can beat you with a base hit or a long ball . He 's what you call a complete player – tremendous defender , but more so in the 3 @-@ hole , he can do so many things for you . He 's so dangerous . " Kemp , with a single and a walk , became the first Dodger to reach base twice in an All @-@ Star Game since Mike Piazza in 1996 . 
 Kemp hit his 30th home run of the season on August 26 , and in the process became the second Dodger player of all time to hit at least 30 homers and steal at least 30 bases in the same season ( 30 – 30 club ) . The only other one was Raúl Mondesí in the 1997 and 1999 seasons . He picked up his 40th stolen base on September 17 , becoming the 18th Major Leaguer and first Dodger in history to hit at least 30 homers and steal at least 40 bases . Kemp also scored his 100th run of the season , making him just the 10th L.A. Dodger to score 100 runs and have 100 RBIs in a season , and the first since Jeff Kent in 2005 . He hit his 35th home run on September 21 , making him the 14th Major Leaguer ( and first since Alfonso Soriano in 2006 ) to hit at least 35 home runs and steal at least 35 bases in a season . 
 On September 20 , the Dodgers announced Kemp was selected by his teammates as the recipient of the 2011 Roy Campanella Award , which is given annually to the Dodger player who best exemplifies the spirit and leadership of the late Roy Campanella . He also won the NL Player of the Week Award for the week of September 19 – 25 , 2011 after he hit .423 ( 11 for 26 ) with nine runs scored and three home runs during that week . 
 Kemp wound up hitting 39 home runs in 2011 with 126 RBIs , leading the league in both categories , the first Dodger to do so since Dolph Camilli in the 1941 season . He also led the league in runs scored ( 115 ) , total bases ( 353 ) , OPS + ( 171 ) , and WAR ( 10 @.@ 0 ) . He finished second in slugging percentage ( <unk> ) , OPS ( .986 ) , extra base hits ( 76 ) , and stolen bases ( 40 , tied ) , and third in batting average ( .324 ) and outfield assists ( 11 ) . Kemp also extended his games played streak to 364 games , as he played in every game of the season . He was the first player to finish in the top two in both home runs and steals since Hank Aaron in the 1963 season . 
 After struggling to hit with runners in scoring position the previous year , Kemp bounced back and hit well with runners in scoring position . In 155 at @-@ bats with runners in scoring position , he hit .335 ( 52 @-@ for @-@ 155 ) with 13 home runs and 87 RBIs . And against right @-@ handers , he batted .319 ( 150 @-@ for @-@ 470 ) with 28 home runs and 94 RBIs . 
 Kemp was selected for a number of post @-@ season awards , including the Baseball America Major League Player of the Year , the Hank Aaron Award for the top hitter in the National League ( the first Dodger player to ever win the award ) the Gold Glove Award and the Silver Slugger Award . On October 27 , he was named to the 2011 Sporting News National League All @-@ Star team . 
 On November 22 , Kemp came in second to Ryan Braun in the voting for the National League Most Valuable Player Award . Later , it was revealed that Braun had tested positive for elevated testosterone and baseball attempted to suspend him , but lost on appeal . A survey of baseball writers revealed that if the MVP vote was retaken , with knowledge of Braun 's positive test , then Kemp would have won . Braun was eventually suspended as part of the Biogenesis scandal . Kemp publicly stated that he believed Braun should be stripped of his MVP Award from that season . 
 After the season , Kemp signed a franchise record 8 @-@ year , $ 160 million contract extension . After signing his extension , he predicted that he would become the first player in history to have a 50 – 50 season . 
 = = = = 2012 = = = = 
 Kemp started the 2012 season by winning the National League Player of the Week award for the opening weekend . He hit two home runs and drove in eight RBIs during the opening series against the San Diego Padres . He was also the first Dodger to record three consecutive multi @-@ hit games to start the season since Adrián Beltré did it in the 2000 season . This was the third time he had won the award , and second consecutive as he had won it the final week of 2011 as well . On April 10 , Kemp became the first LA Dodger to have an RBI in the first five games of the season since J. D. Drew in the 2006 season and , counting the end of the previous season , he had nine straight games with an RBI , tying Roy Campanella ( 1955 season ) and Augie Galan ( 1944 season ) for the Dodgers franchise record . Kemp also won the Player of the Week award for the second week of the season , which , combined with winning the award in the last week of 2011 , made him the only player to ever win three consecutive awards . He was also only the second player to win the award twice to begin the season , the other being Tony Armas for the 1981 Athletics . Kemp hit 12 – 22 with 4 HRs and a 1 @.@ 182 slugging percentage , leading the club to its best 10 @-@ game start since 1981 . 
 Kemp hit his 10th home run of the season on April 25 , tying Gary Sheffield 's club record for homers in April set in the 2000 season . He broke Sheffield 's record with a walk @-@ off homer against the Washington Nationals on April 28 . Kemp was also named National League player of the month for April . 
 Kemp was placed on the disabled list on May 14 because of a hamstring injury , ending his streak of 399 consecutive games played , which was the longest in the majors at the time . After his DL stint , he promptly re @-@ injured his hamstring two days later while running the bases , and returned to the DL . Despite missing about 2 months with injuries , Kemp was voted by the fans as a starter for the 2012 Major League Baseball All @-@ Star Game . As he was still on the disabled list , Kemp did not play in the game but he did participate in the Home Run Derby for the second straight year , hitting one home run in the Derby . Kemp finally returned to the Dodgers lineup on July 13 , after missing about two months with his hamstring injury . 
 Kemp 's injury woes continued as he crashed into the outfield wall at Coors Field in Colorado on August 28 , and injured both his knee and his shoulder . He continued to play despite the injuries . He finished the season batting .303 with 23 home runs and 69 RBIs in 106 games . His 9 stolen bases were his fewest since his first season . 
 After the season , Kemp underwent surgery on his sore shoulder to repair a torn labrum and some minor damage to his rotator cuff . He was told that he wouldn 't be able to swing a bat again until January . 
 = = = = 2013 = = = = 
 Kemp recorded his 1,000th career hit on May 12 , 2013 , against the Miami Marlins . 
 However , Kemp struggled out of the gate in 2013 , subsequent to his shoulder surgery in the offseason . On May 27 , Kemp went 0 @-@ for @-@ 5 with 4 strikeouts , and was booed heavily by the majority of the Dodgers crowd . Teammate Adrian Gonzalez said that Kemp was " trying too hard for the team and the fans . " 
 On May 29 , Kemp injured his right hamstring in a game . He left during the seventh inning , and did not return to the game . Kemp was placed on the 15 @-@ day disabled list on May 30 . He spent time rehabbing at Camelback Ranch , the Dodgers spring training home , and was close to returning when he suffered a setback on June 9 . Kemp returned to the Dodgers on June 25 , after missing 24 games . In that game , Kemp made a game @-@ ending catch while reaching over his shoulder , robbing the Giants ' Marco <unk> of a hit . 
 He returned to the disabled list on July 8 , after experiencing pain in his surgically repaired shoulder . He returned from the DL again on July 21 against the Washington Nationals , and was 3 for 4 with a home run and a double in the game . 
 However , he injured his ankle in a play at home plate in the ninth inning of the game . After initially expressing optimism that the injury was not serious , he again was placed on the 15 @-@ day DL on July 24 . Reacting to criticism of his string of injuries , Kemp said : " I 'm not made of glass . " 
 Kemp 's ankle injury took a lot longer to heal than had been expected , and the team reported that they hoped to get him back in September . However , when he finally began his minor league rehab assignment at Class @-@ A Rancho Cucamonga in late August , he struggled at the plate and his return date was pushed back . He went hitless in five games , with seven strikeouts , and when the minor league season ended on September 2 he was moved to Camelback Ranch to continue his rehab rather than being activated . 
 A few days later , he experienced tightness in the same hamstring he had hurt earlier in the year , and the Dodgers shut him down indefinitely . He eventually rejoined the Dodgers lineup on September 17 , and had four hits ( including two doubles ) in four at bats . He played regularly in an attempt to get his timing back before the playoffs . 
 However , he was a late scratch from a game on September 28 because of soreness in his ankle . An MRI the following day revealed major swelling in a weight @-@ bearing bone in his ankle . Kemp was told that if he kept playing his ankle could break and leave him with chronic problems for the rest of his career . He was shut down , and the team announced he would not be available for the playoffs and would have surgery to repair the problem . Kemp suffered an articular <unk> injury requiring microfracture surgery to his talus bone . 
 He appeared in only 73 games in 2013 , due to his various injuries . He hit .270 with 6 home runs and 33 RBIs , and a .395 slugging percentage . 
 With the Dodgers crowded outfield situation , Kemp was the subject of much trade speculation after the season . His agent , Dave Stewart , publicly stated that he expected Kemp to be traded during the off @-@ season . However , Stewart later remarked that the team had assured him that it would not be making such a trade . 
 = = = = 2014 = = = = 
 Recovering from various injuries , Kemp sat out most of spring training and only started playing in minor league rehab games after the Dodgers left for their season @-@ opening series in Australia . He began the season on the disabled list , and rejoined the Dodgers for their home opener in April . 
 Kemp struggled defensively in center field during the first couple of months of the season , a problem that came to a head after a particular bad series for him against the New York Mets in mid @-@ May . Manager Don Mattingly was openly critical of his outfield play following the series . Immediately afterward , the Dodgers made Andre Ethier the starting center fielder , and informed Kemp that he would be moving to left field . However , he was kept out of the lineup for five straight games as he was learning the new position , and was vocally unhappy about it . After playing in left for several weeks , he was moved to right field , a position he had not played regularly since 2009 . He was more comfortable in right which led to the Dodgers moving <unk> Puig to center field . The last week of July , he hit five home runs in six games to win Player of the Week honors for the fifth time in his career . He also won Player of the Month for September , when he hit .322 with nine homers and 25 RBI . For the season , Kemp hit .287 with 25 homers and 89 RBI in 150 games .

 On December 11 , 2014 , he was traded to the San Diego Padres along with Tim <unk> and $ 32 million in cash for Joe Wieland , <unk> <unk> , and Zach <unk> . The trade was not finalized until December 18 due to the Padres expressing some concerns over a physical which revealed Kemp had severe arthritis in both hips . The Padres attempted to renegotiate the deal after the physical but the Dodgers refused , and the deal was consummated as originally conceived . 
 = = = = 2015 = = = = 
 Kemp played his first game with the Padres during opening day on April 6 , 2015 , against his old team , the Dodgers . During that game , Kemp drove in the only 3 runs for the Padres , as the team lost to the Dodgers 6 @-@ 3 . 
 On August 14 , 2015 , on the road against the Colorado Rockies , Kemp became the first player in the Padres ' 7 @,@ 444 @-@ game history to hit for the cycle . In the first inning , he hit a 2 @-@ run home run to center , followed by a single and a double . He finished with a triple to center field in the top of the 9th inning , scoring Yangervis Solarte from first . He finished the night 4 @-@ for @-@ 5 . 
 = = Nickname = = 
 Kemp 's nickname is " The Bison . " During the second major league game of Kemp 's career , on May 29 , 2006 , he stole second base in the fourth inning , after which Atlanta Braves television announcer Don Sutton said he looked " like a big buffalo running around the bases . " The observation was appropriate due to Kemp 's imposing size – the Dodgers ' roster lists him at 6 ' 4 " tall and 225 pounds – and surprisingly fast foot @-@ speed . The word " buffalo " was modified to " bison " , by the commenter <unk> on Jon Weisman 's popular Dodgers blog , Dodger Thoughts , as it is a more proper term for the North American mammal to which the moniker refers . It wasn 't until the next day when the starting lineup did not include Kemp that baseball writer Eric Enders , also commenting in Dodger Thoughts added the capitalized article in front of the animal , completing the nickname , writing " So much for looking forward to watching The Bison tonight . " 
 The nickname also refers to Kemp 's Oklahoma roots . The bison is the official state animal of Oklahoma .

 In 2008 , an ex @-@ girlfriend filed a restraining order against Kemp , claiming that she had been abused by him . However , she later dropped the complaint and her representative stated that the restraining order " had nothing to do with domestic violence .

 Kemp is involved in charities for children , even creating a community initiative called Kemp 's Kids hosted children from the Los Angeles area during several games at Dodger Stadium . Some of these children were from the Challenger Boys & Girls Club . 
 = Opisthocoelicaudia = 
 Opisthocoelicaudia / <unk> / was a genus of sauropod dinosaur of the Late Cretaceous Period discovered in the Gobi Desert of Mongolia . The only species is Opisthocoelicaudia <unk> . A well @-@ preserved skeleton lacking only the head and neck was unearthed in 1965 by Polish and Mongolian scientists , making Opisthocoelicaudia one of the best known sauropods from the Late Cretaceous . Tooth marks on this skeleton indicate that large carnivorous dinosaurs had fed on the carcass and possibly had carried away the now @-@ missing parts . To date , only two additional , much less complete specimens are known , including a part of a shoulder and a fragmentary tail . A relatively small sauropod , Opisthocoelicaudia measured about 11 @.@ 4 metres ( 37 ft ) in length . Like other sauropods , it would have been characterised by a small head sitting on a very long neck and a barrel shaped trunk carried by four column @-@ like legs . The name Opisthocoelicaudia means " posterior cavity tail " , alluding to the unusual , <unk> condition of the anterior tail vertebrae that were concave on their posterior sides . This and other skeletal features lead researchers to propose that Opisthocoelicaudia was able to rear on its hindlegs . 
 Named and described by Polish paleontologist Maria Magdalena Borsuk @-@ Białynicka in 1977 , Opisthocoelicaudia was first thought to be a new member of the Camarasauridae , but is currently considered a derived member of the Titanosauria . Its exact relationships within Titanosauria are contentious , but it may have been close to the North American Alamosaurus . All Opisthocoelicaudia fossils stem from the Nemegt Formation . Despite being rich in dinosaur fossils , the only other sauropod from this rock unit is Nemegtosaurus , which is known from a single skull . Since the skull of Opisthocoelicaudia remains unknown , several researchers have suggested that Nemegtosaurus and Opisthocoelicaudia may represent the same species . Sauropod footprints from the Nemegt Formation , which include skin impressions , can probably be referred to either Nemegtosaurus or Opisthocoelicaudia as these are the only known sauropods from this formation . 
 = = Description = = 
 Like other sauropods , Opisthocoelicaudia had a small head on a long neck , a barrel @-@ shaped body on four columnar limbs , and a long tail . It was relatively small for a sauropod ; the type specimen was estimated at 11 @.@ 4 m ( 37 ft ) from the head to the tip of the tail . The body mass has been estimated at 8 @.@ 4 t ( 19 @,@ 000 lb ) , 10 @.@ 5 t ( 23 @,@ 000 lb ) , 22 t ( 49 @,@ 000 lb ) , 13 t ( 29 @,@ 000 lb ) and 25 @.@ 4 t ( 56 @,@ 000 lb ) in separate studies . 
 The skull and neck are not preserved , but the reconstruction of the nuchal ligament indicates the possession of a neck of medium length of roughly 5 m ( 16 ft ) . As in other titanosaurs , the back was quite flexible due to the lack of accessory vertebral joints ( hyposphene @-@ <unk> articulations ) , while the pelvic region was strengthened by an additional sixth hip vertebra . The anterior vertebrae of the tail were opisthocoelous , which means they were convex on their anterior sides and concave on their back sides , forming ball @-@ and @-@ socket joints . These opisthocoelous tail vertebrae lend Opisthocoelicaudia its name and serve to distinguish the genus from all other titanosaurs . Other titanosaurs were usually characterised by strongly procoelous anterior tail vertebrae , which were concave on their anterior sides and convex on their back sides . Another unique feature can be found in the back vertebrae , which show bifurcated spinous processes , resulting in a double row of bony projections along the top of the spine . While unique in titanosaurs , this feature can be found in several other unrelated sauropods , including Diplodocus and Euhelopus , where it evolved independently . 
 As in the hips of other titanosaurs , the ischium was relatively short , measuring only two @-@ thirds the length of the pubis . The left and right ischium bones as well as the left and right pubis bones were ossified with each other over most of their length , closing the gap that in other sauropods is normally present between these bones . The limbs were proportionally short , as seen in other titanosaurs . The forelimbs measured 1 @.@ 87 m ( 6 @.@ 1 ft ) in height in the nearly complete specimen , approximately two thirds the length of the hindlimbs , which were reconstructed at 2 @.@ 46 m ( 8 @.@ 1 ft ) height . As in other titanosaurs , the limbs were slightly spread outwards rather than standing vertically under the body , while the forelimbs were more flexible and mobile compared to other sauropods . 
 The manus was composed merely of the five <unk> , which were orientated vertically and arranged in a semicircle . Carpal bones were missing , as in other titanosaurs . Finger bones and claws were also completely absent – in most other titanosaurs , these bones were still present though extremely reduced in size . In the foot , the talus bone was strongly reduced as in other titanosaurs , while the calcaneus was probably completely absent in Opisthocoelicaudia . In contrast to the manus , the foot showed well developed digits and claws . The phalangeal formula , which states the number of phalanges ( digit bones ) beginning with the innermost digit , is 2 @-@ 2 @-@ 2 @-@ 1 @-@ 0 . Foot skeletons of titanosaurs are rarely found , and besides Opisthocoelicaudia , completely preserved examples are known only from <unk> and the unnamed La Invernada titanosaur , whose phalangeal formulas are 2 @-@ 2 @-@ 3 @-@ 2 @-@ 0 and 2 @-@ 2 @-@ 2 @-@ 2 @-@ 0 , respectively . Of these three titanosaurs , <unk> was the most derived while showing the fewest phalanges , indicating a progressive reduction in the phalangeal count during titanosaur evolution . 
 Osteoderms ( bony plates formed in the skin ) have been found with at least 10 titanosaur genera . The lack of osteoderms in the nearly complete Opisthocoelicaudia skeleton might indicate that they are absent in this genus . However the <unk> related Alamosaurus was found to have osteoderms nearly a century after its discovery , this combined with basal forms like <unk> and a number of closely related titanosaurs also bearing osteoderms it 's possible that <unk> had them as well . 
 = = Discovery and specimens = = 
 The type specimen ( <unk> MgD @-@ <unk> ) was discovered between the 10th and 23 June 1965 , during a joint Polish @-@ Mongolian paleontological expedition led by Polish paleontologist Zofia Kielan @-@ Jaworowska . The largest of a series of expeditions carried out in 1963 – 1971 , this expedition involved 21 members , which at times were supported by additional hired Mongolian workers . The site of discovery is located in Ömnögovi Province in southern Mongolia in the Altan Uul area , which exposes some 100 km ² of badlands . The sediments exposed at Altan Uul belong to the Nemegt Formation , the youngest of the three geological formations of the Nemegt Basin . Opisthocoelicaudia was the first of several important dinosaur discoveries made by the 1965 expedition . The other finds , made at different localities , include several skeletons of the tyrannosaurid Tarbosaurus as well as the type specimens of the giant ornithomimosaur Deinocheirus , the sauropod Nemegtosaurus , and the pachycephalosaur Homalocephale . 
 On the fifth day of fieldwork , Ryszard <unk> , the geologist of the expedition , found a concretion of well @-@ preserved bones which promised to belong to a fairly complete skeleton . Excavation started on the next day , revealing a nearly complete skeleton lacking only the head and neck . Until today , this specimen remains by far the most complete find of this dinosaur . The transport of the specimen out of rough terrain caused major technical problems . Stone blocks containing the fossils had to be moved some 580 m on improvised metal sledges made out of petrol drums before they could be loaded onto trucks . Because the skeleton was embedded in very hard sandstone layers , several blocks weighed over a ton . On the 9th of July , the packing of the skeleton into 35 crates started for transportation to <unk> ; together , the crates weighed about 12 tons . 
 The type specimen belonged to an aged individual . Its taphonomy is unusual as it was found lying on its back – in contrast , most other nearly complete dinosaur skeletons of the Nemegt Formation usually are found lying on their sides . The specimen was found encased in cross @-@ bedded sandstone deposited by a river . Most of the discovered vertebrae were still connected together , forming a continuous series that consisted of 8 dorsal , 6 sacral and 34 caudal vertebrae . An additional 3 vertebrae were found isolated from the series and may belong to the transitional area between back and neck . The remaining parts of the skeleton were shifted slightly out of their original anatomical position . Both the left limb and rib bones were found on the right side of the body , while conversely the right limb and rib bones were found on the left side . Bite marks have been identified on the skeleton , particularly in the pelvis and the thigh bone , showing that predators had fed on the carcass . The skull and neck are missing , indicating that the carnivores might have carried away these body parts . The completeness of the remains indicate that the individual had died near the discovery site . A flooding event might have transported the carcass a short distance and subsequently covered it with sediment , even before the soft tissue had decayed entirely . 
 In 1977 , Polish paleontologist Maria Magdalena Borsuk @-@ Białynicka published her comprehensive description of the skeleton and named Opisthocoelicaudia <unk> as a new genus and species . The genus name , hinting at the unusual <unk> condition of the tail vertebrae , means " posterior cavity tail " . It is derived from the Greek <unk> , <unk> [ back ] , κοιλος , koilos [ hollow ] , and Latin cauda [ tail ] . The specific name honors Wojciech <unk> , the person who prepared the type specimen . Opisthocoelicaudia was only the third sauropod from Asia known from a postcranial skeleton , after Euhelopus and Mamenchisaurus . Today , the skeleton is part of the collection of the Institute of Geology of the Mongolian Academy of Sciences in Ulaanbaatar . 
 Besides the type specimen , Borsuk @-@ Białynicka described a shoulder blade and coracoid ( <unk> MgD @-@ I / <unk> ) from the same locality . These bones were not yet fused to each other , indicating a juvenile individual . Philip Currie and colleagues in 2003 mentioned a fragmentary tail ( MPD 100 / 406 ) from the Nemegt locality that can be attributed to Opisthocoelicaudia . 
 = = Age and paleoenvironment = = 
 The Nemegt Formation was deposited within the Late Cretaceous , although its exact age is unknown as it has never been dated radiometrically . According to different authors , the formation is late Campanian to early Maastrichtian , early Maastrichtian , or middle Maastrichtian in age . The sediments of the Nemegt Formation were deposited in a plain crossed by rivers . The climate was warm and subhumid with seasonal droughts , and the soils were relatively dry . Nevertheless , the Nemegt Formation was more humid than the underlying ( and thus older ) Barun Goyot and Djadochta Formations , which show a semiarid climate . 
 The fauna of the Nemegt Formation includes aquatic or amphibious animals such as fish , turtles , and crocodiles as well as birds and the abundant medium to large sized dinosaurs , while smaller terrestrial vertebrates like lizards and mammals are rare . Theropod dinosaurs are very diverse in the Nemegt and include the abundant tyrannosaur Tarbosaurus , which might have preyed upon Opisthocoelicaudia . The only other known sauropod is Nemegtosaurus , which is known from a single skull . Ornithischians are represented by the " duck @-@ billed " hadrosaurids ( including the very common Saurolophus ) , the thick @-@ skulled pachycephalosaurs , and the <unk> armored ankylosaurs . <unk> are absent , despite being present in the older Barun Goyot and Djadochta formations . Other important dinosaur finds from the same locality as Opisthocoelicaudia include the troodontid Borogovia and the ankylosaur Tarchia . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Originally , Opisthocoelicaudia was classified as a member of the family Camarasauridae , together with Camarasaurus and Euhelopus . This classification was based on several shared features of the skeleton , most importantly the forked neural spines of the back vertebrae . In 1977 , Borsuk @-@ Białynicka considered Opisthocoelicaudia closer to Euhelopus than to Camarasaurus , placing it in the subfamily <unk> . A 1981 study by Walter Coombs and Ralph Molnar , on the other hand , considered it a member of the subfamily <unk> and therefore a close relative of Camarasaurus . Today , both Euhelopus and Opisthocoelicaudia are classified outside the Camarasauridae . In 1993 , Leonardo Salgado and Rodolfo Coria showed Opisthocoelicaudia to represent a titanosaur and classified it within the family Titanosauridae . The name Titanosauridae is currently considered invalid by many scientists ; instead , the name Lithostrotia is often used as an equivalent . 
 Within the Lithostrotia , Opisthocoelicaudia has been found to be closely related to the genera Alamosaurus , <unk> , <unk> and Saltasaurus , together forming the family Saltasauridae . <unk> of these genera are contested . Many scientists considered Opisthocoelicaudia to be most closely related to Alamosaurus , with both genera forming a monophyletic group , the Opisthocoelicaudiinae . Other scientists came to the conclusion that the Opisthocoelicaudiinae is paraphyletic ( not forming a natural group ) . Contradicting most other studies , Upchurch and colleagues in 2004 argued that Alamosaurus has to be placed outside the Saltasauridae as a close relative of <unk> , and therefore is not related to Opisthocoelicaudia at al . 
 The following cladogram is based on Calvo and colleagues ( 2007 ) , showing a monophyletic Opisthocoelicaudiinae : 
 = = = Relationship to Nemegtosaurus = = = 
 Another sauropod of the Nemegt @-@ Formation , Nemegtosaurus , is known only from a skull . Opisthocoelicaudia , on the other hand , lacks both the skull and neck , precluding a direct comparison and leading to suspicions that it may represent a synonym of Nemegtosaurus . According to the International Code of Zoological Nomenclature ( ICZN ) , the oldest name has priority over younger synonyms – if Opisthocoelicaudia would be shown to be a synonym of Nemegtosaurus , the name Nemegtosaurus would remain valid while Opisthocoelicaudia would become invalid . 
 Both Opisthocoelicaudia and Nemegtosaurus where discovered during the 1965 joint Polish @-@ Mongolian expedition . Before the remains were prepared and described , the expedition crew believed both finds to belong to the same species of sauropod . In 1977 , Borsuk @-@ Białynicka deemed Opisthocoelicaudia and Nemegtosaurus to represent separate genera because Nemegtosaurus was at this time considered to be a member of the Dicraeosauridae , while Opisthocoelicaudia seemed to be a representative of a different group , the Camarasauridae . Furthermore , she argued that different sauropod genera sharing the same habitat is nothing unusual ; this is most obvious in the North American Morrison Formation , which contains more than five contemporary sauropod species . 
 Currently , both Opisthocoelicaudia and Nemegtosaurus are classified within the Titanosauria , and Jeffrey Wilson stated in 2005 that synonymy cannot be ruled out . In a 2003 study , Currie and colleagues argued that a synonymy is very probable and reported a fragmentary tail referable to Opisthocoelicaudia that was discovered in the same locality where the Nemegtosaurus skull was found . Nevertheless , Kielan @-@ Jaworowska stated in 2013 that the question of a possible synonymy may not be resolved until a skull is found in association with postcranial remains .

 = = = Posture = = = 
 Originally , Borsuk @-@ Białynicka assumed that in standard position the neck was horizontal or slanted slightly downward . This was based on the reconstruction of the nuchal ligament , which runs atop of the cervical and dorsal vertebrae and serves to support the weight of the head and neck . Although an S @-@ curved , swan @-@ like ascending neck was envisaged in several subsequent reconstructions following similar depictions of better known sauropods , recent studies argue that sauropod necks were relatively straight and were carried more horizontally . 
 The back was also reconstructed in a more or less horizontal orientation by Borsuk @-@ Białynicka , which was followed by most subsequent depictions . In a 2007 study , Daniela Schwarz and colleagues suggested that the back dipped towards the rear . According to these researchers , the shoulder blade would have been inclined at a horizontal angle of 55 – 65 ° , much steeper than previously thought , resulting in an elevated shoulder region . With the vertebral column of the trunk and neck held in a relatively straight line , this would result in an elevated position of the head . 
 = = = Rearing stance = = = 
 Opisthocoelicaudia may have been able to rear up on its hindlimbs for foraging , using its tail as a third leg . In 1977 , Borsuk @-@ Białynicka cited several skeletal features that might have been related to rearing , including the opisthocoelous vertebrae of the anterior part of the tail , which , according to this author , would have made the tail more flexible than in other sauropods . Features of the pelvis , such as the thickened shelf of the acetabulum , the flaring ilia , and the fused pubic symphysis , may have allowed the pelvis to withstand the stress of rearing . 
 Heinrich Mallison in 2011 argued that Opisthocoelicaudia was able to angle the anterior part of the tail against the posterior part , producing a buckle in midsection . Thus , the anterior part would have been more straight during rearing than in other sauropods . In 2005 , Wilson assumed that rearing was an innovation not only of Opisthocoelicaudia but also of related genera within the subfamily <unk> . Common features of these genera , such as the shortened tail , may have evolved as adaptations to rearing . 
 = = = Footprints = = = 
 Footprints from the Nemegt Formation were unknown until 2003 , when Currie and colleagues described several examples from the Nemegt locality . Most of these footprints belonged to hadrosaurids ( probably Saurolophus ) , while two have been left by a large theropod ( probably Tarbosaurus ) and yet another two by the hindfoot of a sauropod . The sauropod tracks were assigned to Opisthocoelicaudia , which showed a matching hind foot morphology . The researchers argued that Opisthocoelicaudia was probably the only known sauropod from the Nemegt Formation when Nemegtosaurus is regarded a synonym , making it unlikely that the tracks were left by another , similar titanosaur . The tracks were left in the soft and wet mud of shallow or freshly dried up points along a river and subsequently filled up with sand . Today only the sand infill remains , with the encasing mudstone having been eroded away . 
 The best @-@ preserved footprint measures 63 cm ( 25 in ) across , so it was probably created by an individual larger than the type specimen . Although the surface of the underside is hard to obtain , the vertical surfaces are very well preserved , making this track one of the best preserved sauropod tracks known . Four digital impressions can be distinguished , with two or three showing claw impressions . The toes were almost perpendicular . Even a skin impression has been preserved above the impression of the first toe , which shows the non @-@ overlapping scales , each with an average diameter of 14 mm ( 0 @.@ 55 in ) . The foot of the track creator was probably a little longer than wide . The second track is much shallower than the first , but shows well @-@ preserved digit impressions with a high degree of detail , including at least two deep claw impressions that are rotated outwards , and a well @-@ preserved impression of a fleshy toe pad behind the middle claw . 
 = Death of Keith Blakelock = 
 Keith Henry Blakelock , a London Metropolitan Police constable , was killed on 6 October 1985 during rioting on the Broadwater Farm housing estate in Tottenham , north London . The trouble broke out after a local black woman died of heart failure during a police search of her home . It took place against a backdrop of unrest in several English cities and a breakdown of relations between the police and black communities . 
 PC Blakelock had been assigned on the night of his death to Serial 502 , a unit of 10 constables and one sergeant dispatched to protect firefighters . When the rioters forced the officers back , Blakelock stumbled and fell . Surrounded by a mob of 30 to 50 people , he received more than 40 injuries inflicted by machetes or similar , and was found with a six @-@ inch @-@ long knife in his neck , buried up to the hilt . He was the first constable to be killed in a riot in Britain since 1833 , when PC Robert Culley was stabbed to death in Clerkenwell , London . 
 Detectives came under enormous pressure to find the killers , amid tabloid coverage that left @-@ wing journalists claimed was sometimes openly racist . Faced with a lack of forensic evidence , the police arrested 359 people , interviewed most of them without lawyers , and laid charges based on <unk> confessions . Three adults and three youths were charged with the murder ; the adults , Winston Silcott , Engin Raghip and Mark Braithwaite ( the " Tottenham Three " ) , were convicted in 1987 . A widely supported campaign arose to overturn the convictions , which were quashed in 1991 when forensic tests cast doubt on the authenticity of detectives ' notes from an interview in which Silcott appeared to incriminate himself . Two detectives were charged in 1992 with perverting the course of justice , and were acquitted in 1994 . 
 Police re @-@ opened the murder inquiry in 1992 and again in 2003 . Ten men were arrested in 2010 on suspicion of murder , and in 2013 one of them , Nicholas Jacobs , became the seventh person to be charged with Blakelock 's murder , based largely on evidence gathered during the 1992 inquiry . He was found not guilty in April 2014 . 
 Blakelock and the other constables of Serial 502 were awarded the Queen 's Gallantry Medal for bravery in 1988 . Their sergeant , David Pengelly , who – armed only with a shield and truncheon – placed himself in front of the crowd in an effort to save Blakelock and another officer , received the George Medal , awarded for acts of great bravery .

 Keith Henry Blakelock ( 28 June 1945 – 6 October 1985 ) was born in Sunderland . He joined the Metropolitan Police on 14 November 1980 , and was assigned to a response team in Hornsey before becoming a home beat officer in Muswell Hill , north London . At the time of his death , he was married to Elizabeth Blakelock , with three sons , Mark , Kevin and Lee . Lee Blakelock , eight years old when his father died , became a police officer himself , joining Durham Constabulary in 2000 . PC Blakelock is buried in East Finchley Cemetery . 
 = = = Broadwater Farm = = = 
 Broadwater Farm in Tottenham , in the Borough of Haringey , north London ( <unk> ) , emerged from the British government 's policy from the 1930s onwards of slum clearance , in which poorly maintained terraced houses were bulldozed to make way for high @-@ rise social housing . Built between 1967 and 1973 , the Farm consists of 1 @,@ 063 flats ( apartments ) in 12 blocks raised on stilts , linked by first @-@ floor outdoor connecting walkways ; no homes or shops were built at ground level for fear of flooding from the nearby River Moselle . At the time of Blakelock 's death the estate housed 3 @,@ 400 people , 49 percent white , 43 percent Afro @-@ Caribbean . 
 British journalist David Rose writes that by 1976 the Farm was already seen as a sink estate , and by 1980 a Department of the Environment report had suggested demolition , although a regeneration project after the 1985 riots led to improvements . Sir Kenneth Newman , Metropolitan Police commissioner from 1982 to 1987 , regarded the estate as one of London 's symbolic locations , or potential no @-@ go areas , along with Railton Road in Brixton , All Saints Road in Notting Hill , the Notting Hill Carnival , and the Stonebridge Estate in Harlesden . The 1986 Gifford Inquiry into the rioting criticized the police for having adopted this attitude . 
 The elevated linked walkways meant the estate could be crossed without descending to street level . Combined with the ground @-@ level parking spaces beloved of drug dealers , these had turned the estate into what commentators called a " rabbit warren " for criminals , to the point where residents were afraid to leave their homes . Dutch architectural historian Wouter <unk> described the estate as it was at the time of the riots : 
 [ T ] here are elevated walkways , there are little stairs that connect them , there are these huge stairwells where the different elevated walkways come together ... there is a huge underground zone that is completely unmonitored , which consists of parking places ... so it 's an incredible nest ... one of these typical modernist , multi @-@ level network city constructions that make it extremely difficult for the police to exert any control over it , and it makes the police extremely vulnerable for attacks from behind , underneath , from the top . 
 = = = Social unrest across England = = = 
 The riots in which Blakelock died took place within a wave of social unrest across England . Since the 1980 St. Pauls riot in Bristol , and particularly since the 1981 Brixton riot in south London , a series of incidents had sparked violent confrontations between black youths and largely white police officers . 
 On 9 September 1985 , a month before Blakelock 's murder , there was rioting in Handsworth , Birmingham , after the arrest of a black man for a traffic offence ; two people were killed . On 28 September , a black woman , Dorothy " Cherry " Groce ( 1948 – 2011 ) , was accidentally shot by police while they searched her home in Brixton looking for her son , Michael Groce , who was wanted on suspicion of robbery and firearms offences . 
 Believing she had died in the shooting – in fact , she survived but was left paralysed from the waist down – a group of protesters gathered outside Brixton police station , and rioting broke out that saw police lose control of the area for 48 hours . A photojournalist , 29 @-@ year @-@ old David Hodge , was killed when a breeze block was dropped on his head while he photographed the looting . 
 Rumours spread throughout London that more rioting was imminent , including in Bermondsey and the Wood Green shopping centre near Broadwater Farm . On 1 October there were disturbances in Toxteth , Liverpool , and on the same day police stopped and searched all vehicles entering the Farm , finding a petrol bomb there the next day . David Rose wrote in 1992 .

 On Saturday , 5 October 1985 , a week after the Brixton riot , police arrested Floyd Jarrett , a 24 @-@ year @-@ old black man from Tottenham , on suspicion of being in a stolen car . It was a suspicion that turned out to be groundless , but a decision was made several hours later to search the home of his mother , Cynthia Jarrett , for stolen goods . In the course of the search she collapsed and died of heart failure . Rose writes that the pathologist , Dr. Walter Somerville , told the inquest that Mrs. Jarrett had a heart condition that meant she probably only had months to live . 
 According to Rose , the police let themselves into the house using Floyd 's keys , without knocking or announcing themselves , while Mrs. Jarrett and her family were watching television . The family said that an officer pushed Mrs. Jarrett , causing her to fall . The officer denied this ; the police said she had not been pushed but had simply collapsed . When it became clear she had stopped breathing , the same officer tried to revive her using mouth @-@ to @-@ mouth resuscitation , to no avail . The pathologist testified at the inquest that the fall may have been a precipitating factor ; the jury returned a verdict of accidental death , following the coroner 's direction that such a verdict would mean Mrs. Jarrett had been pushed , but perhaps accidentally . 
 = = = ( 6 October ) Rioting breaks out = = = 
 Protesters began to gather outside Tottenham police station , a few hundred yards from Broadwater Farm , around 1 : 30 am on Sunday morning , 6 October . Four of the station 's windows were smashed , but the Jarrett family asked the crowd to disperse . Later that day , two police officers were attacked with bricks and paving stones at the Farm , and a police inspector was attacked in his car . 
 The next few hours saw some of the most violent rioting the country had experienced . By early evening a crowd of 500 mostly young black men had gathered on the estate , setting fire to cars , throwing petrol bombs and bricks , and dropping concrete blocks and paving stones from the estate 's outdoor walkways , knocking several police officers unconscious , despite their NATO helmets . The local council 's community relations officer said there was a " shifting convoy of ambulances : as soon as one was loaded up with injured officers , another would move up to take its place . " 
 Apart from Blakelock 's death , 250 police officers were injured , and two policemen and three journalists , one from the Press Association and two from the BBC , suffered gunshot wounds . At least 30 shots were fired from three firearms , the first time shots had been fired by rioters in Britain . At 9 : 45 pm the Metropolitan Police Commissioner , Sir Kenneth Newman , authorized the deployment of specialist police armed with plastic bullets and CS gas to be used " as a last resort should all else fail " ; it would have been the first use of plastic bullets during a riot in Britain . The unit arrived at 10 : 20 pm , but the senior officers at the scene refused to use them , to the apparent dismay of junior officers . The rioting continued until the early hours of the morning . 
 = = = Serial 502 = = = 
 Blakelock was assigned on the night to Serial 502 , a Metropolitan police unit consisting of a sergeant and 10 constables from Hornsey and Wood Green police stations . A " shield serial " was a unit equipped with shields , Nato helmets and a personnel carrier ; expecting trouble , the Metropolitan police had increased the deployment of these patrols across the capital . Serial 502 consisted of three Scots ; three Londoners , including a Jamaican ; and one each from Cumbria , Yorkshire , Gloucestershire , Sunderland and Merseyside . 
 At 9 : 30 pm Sgt David Pengelly led the unit into Broadwater Farm to protect firemen who had earlier been forced out of the estate 's Tangmere block ( pictured ) , where a fire had started in the Centra Supermarket on the first floor . 
 The firemen made their way up an enclosed staircase with Serial 502 behind them . Dozens of rioters suddenly appeared at the top of the stairs , blowing whistles and throwing bottles . Pengelly ordered the officers and firefighters to retreat . They were forced to run backwards down the unlit narrow staircase , fearful of tripping over the fire hoses , which had been flat before but were now full of water . PC Richard Coombes , armed with just a short truncheon , said the noise – " Kill the pigs ! " – was deafening , and he could hardly see through the scratched Perspex visor on his helmet . 
 = = = Attack on Blakelock = = = 
 There were rioters at the bottom of the stairs too , wearing masks or crash helmets , and carrying knives , baseball bats , bricks and petrol bombs . As the firefighters and police ran out of the stairwell toward a car park and a patch of grass , one of the firemen , Trevor Stratford , saw that Blakelock had tripped : " He just stumbled and went down and they were upon him . It was just mob hysteria . ... There were about 50 people on him . " 
 The rioters removed Blakelock 's protective helmet , which was never found . Rose writes that the pathologist , David Bowen , found 54 holes in Blakelock 's overalls , and 40 cutting or stabbing injuries , eight of them to his head , caused by a machete , sword or axe @-@ type instrument . A six @-@ inch @-@ long knife was buried in his neck up to the hilt . His body was covered in marks from having been kicked or stamped on . His hands and arms were badly cut , and he had lost several fingers trying to defend himself . There were 14 stab wounds on his back , one on the back of his right thigh , six on his face , and his jawbone had been smashed by a blow that left a six @-@ inch gash across the right side of his head . Bowen said the force of this blow had been " almost as if to sever his head , " which gave rise to a rumour that an attempt had been made to decapitate him ( according to Rose , the autopsy photographs did not support this ) . 
 A second group surrounded PC Coombes , who sustained a five @-@ inch @-@ long cut to his face , and broken upper and lower jaws . In 2004 he said he was still suffering the effects of the attack , which the police regard as attempted murder , including poor hearing and eyesight , epileptic fits , and a memory so poor that he was left unable to read a book or drive . A third constable , Michael Shepherd , had his protective helmet pierced by an iron spike . Several of the officers and firemen turned and ran back toward the crowd to try to save Blakelock and Coombes . Trevor Stratford told a reporter in 2010 : " I remember running in with another fire officer to get Dick Coombes . I literally slid into the group , like a rugby player charging into a ruck . We dragged him out , but he was in a hell of a state " : 
 I then ran back towards Keith Blakelock . Other police officers were already there . We were all being hit and beaten , but I managed to get hold of his collar and pull his head and shoulders out of the group . One of the other officers helped me to drag him out . 
 Dave Pengelly kept a rearguard barrier between us and the rioters , standing in the middle of it all with just a shield and a truncheon , trying to fend them off , which is an image I 'll never forget . 
 Between us all we managed to manhandle Keith out to the road , and safety . He was already unconscious when I 'd got to him on the ground . I started mouth @-@ to @-@ mouth and heart massage on him , but his injuries were just horrific . 
 He had a knife embedded up to the handle in the back of his neck . We could see he had multiple stab wounds and some of his fingers were missing . I just kept working on him with another officer , and I think we got some response , but only very limited . 
 Blakelock was taken by ambulance to the North Middlesex Hospital , but died on the way . Pengelly said in 2010 that , when the other officers got back to the safety of their van , " We just sat there , numb with shock , and life was never the same again for any of us . " 
 = = First investigation = = 
 = = = Media response = = = 
 Rose writes that there was a racist media frenzy after the killing , placing intense external pressure on detectives to solve the case . According to Rose , the news coverage included the Sun newspaper comparing Labour 's prospective candidate for Tottenham , Bernie Grant – who had immigrated from Guyana in 1963 – to an ape , writing that he had given a press conference while peeling a banana and juggling an orange . Grant had caused uproar when he was reported as saying the police had been given a " bloody good hiding , " although his statement was also reported as : " The youths around here believe the police were to blame for what happened on Sunday and what they got was a bloody good hiding . " 
 The Metropolitan Police commissioner , Kenneth Newman , told reporters that groups of Trotskyists and anarchists had orchestrated the violence , a theme picked up by the Daily Telegraph and others . The Daily Express – falling for a story from media hoaxer Rocky Ryan – reported on 8 October 1985 that a " Moscow @-@ trained hit squad gave orders as mob hacked PC Blakelock to death , " alleging that " crazed left @-@ wing extremists " trained in Moscow and Libya had coordinated the riots . 
 There was also internal pressure on detectives from the rank and file , who saw their superior officers as sharing the blame for Blakelock 's death . The Police Federation 's journal , Police , argued that senior officers had pursued a policy at Broadwater Farm of avoiding confrontation at all costs , and that " community policing " had led to compromises with criminals , rather than maintaining a focus on upholding the law . As a result , the journal wrote , officers had failed to appreciate the seriousness of the situation that had developed on the estate . 
 = = = Detective Chief Superintendent Graham Melvin = = = 
 Detective Chief Superintendent Graham Melvin of the Serious Crime Squad was placed in charge of the investigation a few hours after the killing , at 2 am on 7 October . The inquiry became the largest in the history of the Metropolitan Police , with 150 officers assigned full @-@ time . Melvin was born in Halifax in 1941 , joining the Metropolitan Police in 1960 , then the Criminal Investigation Department . He studied at Bramshill Police College , served with the Flying Squad , and was known for having solved several notorious cases , including that of Kenneth Erskine , the Stockwell Strangler . He became a Detective Chief Superintendent in March 1985 when he joined the elite International and Organised Crime Squad ( <unk> ) . 
 = = = Murder charges = = = 
 Melvin 's first problem was that there was no forensic evidence . Senior officers had not allowed the estate to be sealed off immediately after the attack , which meant that the crime scene had not been secured . Witnesses and those directly involved were able to leave without giving their names . Objects that might have held fingerprints were not collected . Police were not allowed into the estate in great numbers until 4 am , by which time much of the evidence had disappeared . Whatever remained was removed during Haringey Council 's clean @-@ up operation . 
 Melvin therefore resorted to arresting suspects – including juveniles , some of them regarded as vulnerable – and holding them for days without access to lawyers . Of the 359 people arrested in connection with the inquiry in 1985 and 1986 , just 94 were interviewed in the presence of a lawyer . Many of the confessions that resulted , whether directly about the murder , or about having taken part in the rioting , were made before the lawyer was given access to the interviewee . 
 When people did confess to even a minor role in the rioting , such as throwing a few stones , they were charged with affray . One resident told the 1986 Gifford Inquiry into the rioting : " You would go to bed and you would just lie there and you would think , are they going to come and kick my door , what 's going to happen to my children ? ... It was that horrible fear that you lived with day by day , knowing they could come and kick down your door and hold you for hours . " The inquiry heard that 9 @,@ 165 police officers were either deployed on the estate or held in reserve between 10 and 14 October 1985 . Thus , argues Rose , the police created , or at least intensified , a climate of fear in which witnesses were afraid to step forward . 
 Melvin defended his decision to hold people without access to legal advice by arguing that lawyers , unwittingly or otherwise , might pass information they had gleaned during interviews to other suspects . He said under cross @-@ examination during the 1987 murder trial that , in his view , " the integrity of some firms of solicitors left a lot to be desired " ; he believed solicitors were being retained by people who had an interest in learning what other suspects had said . The Crown prosecutor , Roy <unk> QC , told the court that the police had one effective weapon , namely that suspects did not know who else had spoken to police and what they had said , and that " the use of that weapon by the police was legitimate and effective .

 Mark Pennant , aged 15 , was arrested on 9 October 1985 and charged with murder two days later , the first person charged in connection with the killing . Born in England to West Indian parents , Pennant had been raised in the West Indies until he was nine , after which he returned to the UK ; he was diagnosed with learning difficulties and was attending a special school . He was arrested and handcuffed at school , taken to Wood Green Police Station , and interviewed six times over the course of two days with a teacher in attendance . He told the police that he had cut Blakelock and kicked him twice , and named Winston Silcott as the ringleader and several others , including another juvenile , Mark Lambie .

 Jason Hill , a 13 @-@ year @-@ old white boy who lived on Broadwater Farm , was seen looting from a store in the Tangmere block during the rioting , near where Blakelock was killed . He was arrested on 13 October and taken to Leyton Police Station , where he was held for three days without access to a lawyer . He reported being kept in a very hot cell , which he said made sleeping and even breathing difficult . His clothes and shoes were removed for forensic tests and he was interviewed wearing only underpants and a blanket , the latter of which by the third day of detention was stained with his own vomit . Hyacinth Moody of the Haringey Community Relations Council sat in as an " appropriate adult " ; she was criticized by the judge for having failed to intervene . 
 Over the course of several interviews , Hill told police that he had witnessed the attack , and named Silcott and others , including Mark Lambie . He described almost a ritualistic killing and said that Silcott – whom he called " Sticks " – had forced him to make his " mark " on Blakelock with a sword . According to David Rose , Hill described injuries to Blakelock 's body that did not match the autopsy report . 
 After he had cut Blakelock , Hill said , Silcott told him he was cool and asked what he had seen . Hill said he replied , " Nothing , " and that Silcott said , " Well , you can go . " He said the aim of the attack had been to decapitate Blakelock and put his head on a stick . In 1991 he told Rose that , throughout the interview , the police were saying , " Go on , admit it , you had a stab , " and " It was Sticks , wasn 't it ? " He said they threatened to keep him in the station for two weeks and said he would never see his family again . " They could have told me it was Prince Charles and I would have said it was him . "

 Steve Drake , aged 14 , was the third juvenile to be charged with the murder . He was named by Mark Pennant and Jason Hill , and was interviewed with his father and a solicitor present .

One witness said during the trial that he had seen Drake force his way through the crowd to reach Blakelock , although the testimony was discredited ; however Drake spent several years behind bars . 
 = = = = Winston Silcott = = = = 
 David Rose writes that a former detective inspector called the Blakelock investigation a " pre @-@ scientific inquiry , it was all about how to get Winston Silcott convicted , not discovering who killed Keith Blakelock . " By the time of the murder , local police saw Silcott as the " biggest mafioso in Tottenham ... running the mugging gangs , paying them with drugs , " according to another former senior officer in Tottenham . 
 Silcott was 26 years old when he was arrested , the oldest of the six charged with murder . He was born in Tottenham in 1959 ; his parents , both Seventh @-@ day Adventists , had arrived in England from Montserrat two years earlier . He told Rose that he had experienced racism throughout his entire upbringing , particularly from the police . After leaving school at 15 , he took a series of low @-@ paying jobs and in 1976 began breaking into houses . The following year he was convicted of nine counts of burglary and sent to borstal for a few months , and in 1979 he was sentenced to six months for wounding . In September 1980 he stood trial for the murder of 19 @-@ year @-@ old Lennie McIntosh , a postal worker , who was stabbed and killed at a party in Muswell Hill in 1979 . The first trial resulted in a hung jury ; a second trial saw him acquitted . 
 In 1980 Silcott and a friend began operating a mobile disco , " Galaxy Soul Shuffle , " playing at festivals and private parties . In 1983 he was given a government grant to open a greengrocer 's on the deck of the <unk> block of Broadwater Farm . More convictions followed : in October that year he was fined for possessing a flick knife and in March 1984 for obstructing police . In 1985 he made the news when he reportedly told Princess Diana , who was on an official visit to Broadwater Farm , that she should not have come without bringing jobs , which the Sun newspaper interpreted as a threat . 
 In December 1984 Silcott was arrested for the murder of a 22 @-@ year @-@ old boxer , Anthony Smith , at a party in Hackney . Smith had been slashed more than once on his face , there were two wounds to his abdomen , a lung had been lacerated and his aorta cut . Silcott was charged with the murder in May 1985 and was out on bail when Blakelock was killed in October that year . At first he told police he had not known Smith and had not been at the party , although at trial he acknowledged having been there . He said Smith had started punching him , and that he had pushed Smith back but had not been carrying a knife . Silcott was convicted of Smith 's murder in February 1986 , while awaiting trial for the Blakelock murder , and was sentenced to life imprisonment ; he was released in 2003 after serving 17 years . After the conviction he told his lawyer he had indeed known Smith , that there had been bad blood between them , and that he had stabbed the man in self @-@ defence , because one of Smith 's friends had had a knife . 
 = = = = = Arrest and disputed interview = = = = = 
 Known as " Sticks " locally , Silcott was living in the Martlesham block of the Broadwater Farm estate at the time of the riots , and was running his greengrocer 's shop in the Tangmere block , the block near the spot where Blakelock was killed . He told David Rose in 2004 that he had been in the Tangmere block on the night of the death , and had stopped someone throwing a scaffolding pole through the window of his shop . A friend of his , Pam , had then invited him to her apartment to keep him out of trouble . 
 He told Rose : " And look , I 'm on bail for a murder . I know I 'm stupid , but I 'm not that stupid . There 's helicopters , police photographers everywhere . All I could think about was that I didn 't want to lose my bail . " He said he had first learned of Blakelock 's death when he heard cheering in the apartment he was staying in , in response to a news report about it . 
 Silcott was arrested for Blakelock 's murder on 12 October 1985 , six days after the riot ; he was interviewed five times over 24 hours , Det Ch Supt Melvin asking the questions and Detective Inspector Maxwell Dingle taking the notes . During the first four interviews , he stayed mostly silent and refused to sign the detectives ' notes , but during the fifth interview on 13 October , when Melvin said he knew Silcott had struck Blakelock with a machete or sword , his demeanour changed , according to the notes . 
 The notes show him asking : " Who told you that ? " When the detectives said they had witnesses , he reportedly said : " They are only kids . No one is going to believe them . " The notes say he walked around the interview room with tears in his eyes , saying : " You cunts , you cunts , " and " Jesus , Jesus , " then : " You ain 't got enough evidence . Those kids will never go to court . You wait and see . No one else will talk to you . You can 't keep me away from them . " The notes show him saying of the murder weapons : " You 're too slow , man , they gone . " He was at that point charged with murder , to which he reportedly responded : " They won 't give evidence against me . " 
 = = = = Engin Raghip = = = = 
 Nineteen @-@ year @-@ old Engin Raghip , of Turkish – Cypriot descent , was arrested on 24 October 1985 after a friend mentioned his name to police , the only time anyone had linked him to the murder . During his trial , the court heard from an expert that Raghip was " in the middle of the mildly mentally handicapped range , " although this testimony was withheld from the jury . His mental impairment became a key issue during his successful appeal in 1991 in R v Raghip and others , when the court accepted that it rendered his confession unsafe . 
 Raghip 's parents had moved from Cyprus to England in 1956 . Raghip left school at age 15 , illiterate , and by the time of the murder had two convictions , one for stealing cars and one for burglary . He had a common @-@ law wife , Sharon Daly , with whom he had a two @-@ year @-@ old boy , and he worked occasionally as a mechanic . He had little connection with Broadwater Farm , though he lived in nearby Wood Green and had gone to the Farm with two friends to watch the riot , he said . One of those friends , John Broomfield , gave an interview to the Daily Mirror on 23 October , boasting about his involvement . When Broomfield was arrested , he implicated Raghip . Broomfield was later convicted of an unrelated murder . 
 At the time of Raghip 's arrest he had been drinking and smoking cannabis for several days , and his common @-@ law wife had just left him , taking their son with her . He was held for two days without representation , first speaking to a solicitor on the third day , who said he had found Raghip distressed and disoriented . 
 He was interviewed by Det Sgt van Thal and Det Insp John Kennedy ten times over a period of four days . He made several incriminating statements during the interviews , at first admitting he had thrown stones , then during the second interview saying he had seen the attack on Blakelock . During the third , he said he had spoken to Silcott about the murder , and that Silcott owned a hammer with a hook on one side . After the fifth interview he was charged with affray , and during the sixth he described the attack on Blakelock : " It was like you see in a film , a helpless man with dogs on him . It was just like that , it was really quick . " He did not sign this interview , Rose writes , and after it he vomited . 
 During a seventh interview the next day , Raghip described noises he said Blakelock had made during the attack . During the eighth interview , he said he had armed himself that night with a broom handle , and had tried to get close to what was happening to Blakelock , but there were too many people around him : " I had a weapon when I was running toward the policeman , a broom handle . " He said he might have kicked or hit him had he been able to get close enough . Rose writes that Raghip also offered the order in which Blakelock 's attackers had launched the assault . He was held for another two days , released on bail , then charged with murder six weeks later , in December 1985 , under the doctrine of common purpose . 
 = = = = Mark Braithwaite = = = = 
 Mark Braithwaite was 18 when Blakelock was killed , a rapper and disc jockey living with his parents in Islington , London , N1 . He had a girlfriend who lived on Broadwater Farm , with whom he had a child . On 16 January 1986 , three months after the murder , his name was mentioned for the first time to detectives by a man they had arrested , Bernard Kinghorn . Kinghorn told them he had seen Braithwaite , whom he said he knew only by sight , stab Blakelock with a kitchen knife . Kinghorn later withdrew the allegation , telling the BBC three years later that it had been false . 
 Braithwaite was taken to Enfield Police Station and interviewed by Det Sgt Dermot McDermott and Detective Constable Colin Biggar . He was held for three days and was at first denied access to a lawyer , on the instruction of Det Ch Supt Melvin . He was interviewed eight times over the first two days , and with a lawyer present four times on the third . During the first 30 hours of his detention he had nothing to eat , and said in court – as did several other suspects – that the heat in the cells was oppressive , making it difficult to breathe . 
 He at first denied being anywhere near the Farm , then during interview four said he had been there and had thrown stones , and during interview five said he had been at the Tangmere block , but had played no role in the murder . During interview six , he said he had hit Blakelock with an iron bar in the chest and leg . Rose writes that there were no such injuries on Blakelock 's body . In a seventh interview , he said he had hit a police officer , but that it was not Blakelock . On the basis of this confession evidence , he was charged with murder . 
 = = = ( 1987 ) Trial : R v Silcott and others = = = 
 Forty @-@ nine men and youths were convicted of offences arising from the riots , out of 359 arrested and 159 charged , not counting the six murder defendants . The trial of the six – Silcott , Raghip and Braithwaite , the adults ; and Pennant , Hill and Lambie , the youths – began in court number two of the Old Bailey on 14 January 1987 . All the men were charged with murder , riot , and affray ; Lambie was also charged with throwing petrol bombs . 
 The jury consisted of seven men and five women , including one Afro @-@ Caribbean woman . They were not told that it was Silcott 's fourth murder trial , that he had been out on bail for the murder of Anthony Smith when Blakelock was killed , or that he had subsequently been convicted of that murder . Silcott 's barrister , Barbara Mills ( 1940 – 2011 ) , a future Director of Public Prosecutions , decided that he should not take the stand to avoid exposing him to questions about his previous convictions . 
 The effort to avoid introducing the conviction for the murder of Anthony Smith worked against Silcott too . It meant that the jury could not be told that he had signed on for his bail at Tottenham police station at around 7 pm on the evening of Blakelock 's death . This was when witnesses had placed Silcott at a Broadwater Youth Association meeting , making inflammatory speeches against the police . 
 The press coverage of the trial included the publication on day two , by The Sun , of a notorious close @-@ up of a half @-@ smiling Silcott , one that " created a monster to stalk the nightmares of Middle England , " as journalist Kurt <unk> put it . Silcott said he had been asleep in a police cell when it was taken ; he said he was woken up , held in a corridor with his arms pinned against a wall and photographed , and that the expression on his face was one of fear . Its publication constituted " the most gross contempt , " according to the trial judge , Sir Derek Hodgson ( 1917 – 2002 ) , speaking to David Rose in 1992 . No action was taken against the newspaper . 
 The judge dismissed the charges against the youths because they had been detained without access to parents or a lawyer ; in the absence of the jury , the judge was highly critical of the police on that point . Four armoured police vehicles waited in Tottenham as the jury deliberated for three days . They returned on 19 March 1987 with a unanimous guilty verdict against Silcott , Raghip and Braithwaite ; the men were sentenced to life imprisonment , with a recommendation that Silcott serve at least 30 years . The black female juror fainted when the verdicts were read out . Rose writes that the tabloids knew no restraint , writing about the beasts of Broadwater Farm , hooded animals and packs of savages , with the old jail @-@ cell image of Silcott published above captions such as " smile of evil . " 
 = = = ( 1988 ) Application for leave to appeal rejected = = = 
 A campaign to free the " Tottenham Three " gathered pace , organized by the Broadwater Farm Defence Campaign . They published an 18 @-@ page report in 1987 by two American law professors , Margaret Burnham and Lennox Hinds , who had attended part of the trial , and who wrote that Silcott 's conviction " represents a serious miscarriage of justice . " Rose writes that the New Statesman and Time Out wrote sympathetic pieces , and MPs and trade unionists were lobbied . In May 1989 the famously left @-@ wing London School of Economics students ' union elected Silcott as the college 's honorary president , to the dismay of its director and governors . Silcott resigned shortly afterwards , saying he did not want the students to become scapegoats . 
 Engin Raghip 's solicitor was now Gareth Peirce – who had represented the Guildford Four and Birmingham Six , prominent cases of miscarriage of justice – and his barrister Michael Mansfield . Peirce applied for leave to appeal . She began to explore Raghip 's mental state , arguing that his confession could not be relied upon , and arranged for him to be examined by Dr. Gísli Guðjónsson of the Institute of Psychiatry in London , a specialist in suggestibility ; Guðjónsson concluded that Raghip was unusually suggestible , with a mental age of between 10 and 11 . Silcott was again represented by Barbara Mills and Braithwaite by Steven <unk> . Mills noted the lack of photographic or scientific evidence , and argued that Silcott would have been unlikely to stop firefighters from extinguishing a fire on the deck of the Tangmere block , given that he was renting a shop there . 
 Lord Lane , then Lord Chief Justice of England , dismissed the applications on 13 December 1988 , arguing of Raghip that the jury had had ample opportunity to form its own opinion of him . Amnesty International criticized the decision , pointing to the problems with confessions made in the absence of a lawyer , and was criticized in turn by Home Secretary Douglas Hurd , who said Amnesty had abandoned its impartiality . 
 During a BBC Newsnight discussion of the case , Lord Scarman , a former Law Lord , said the convictions ought to be overturned . Gareth Peirce obtained another psychologist 's report about Raghip and , supported by Raghip 's MP Michael Portillo , asked the Home Secretary to review the case . She also submitted an application to the European Court of Human Rights , arguing that the way Raghip had been interviewed breached the European Convention on Human Rights . In December 1990 Home Secretary Kenneth Baker referred Raghip 's case back to the Court of Appeal . 
 = = = ( 1990 ) Electrostatic detection analysis = = = 
 In parallel with the efforts of Pierce , Silcott 's lawyers had requested access in November 1990 to his original interview notes , so that the seven pages from his crucial fifth interview – the notes he said were fabricated – could be submitted for an electrostatic detection analysis ( ESDA ) . The test can identify a small electrostatic charge left on a page when the page above it is written on ; in this way , the test 's developers say , the chronological integrity of interview notes can be determined . 
 In Silcott 's case , according to the scientist who conducted the ESDA test , Robert Radley , the notes from the section of the fifth interview in which Silcott appeared to incriminate himself had been inserted after the other notes were written . The seventh and final page of the fifth interview , where the participants would normally sign , was missing . The ESDA test suggested that , on the third to sixth pages of the interview , no impressions had been left from previous pages , although these earlier impressions appeared throughout the rest of the notes . According to Will Bennett in The Independent , the test " also revealed an imprint of a different page five from the one submitted in evidence which was clearly the same interview with Silcott but in which he made no implicit admissions . " In addition to this , David Baxendale , a Home Office forensic scientist who was asked to investigate by Essex police , said that the paper on which the disputed notes were written came from a different batch of paper from the rest of the interview . 
 The disputed section of the interview had been written down by Det Insp Maxwell Dingle . It said that , when Silcott was told the police had witness statements that he had attacked Blakelock , he replied : " They are only kids . No one is going to believe them " ; he reportedly said later : " Those kids will never go to court , you wait and see . " As a result of the ESDA test evidence , the Home Secretary added Silcott and Braithwaite to Raghip 's appeal . 
 = = = ( 1991 ) Appeal : R v Raghip and others = = = 
 The Court of Appeal heard Silcott 's appeal on 25 November 1991 and took just 90 minutes to overturn the conviction , delivering its 74 @-@ page decision on 5 December . Raghip and Braithwaite 's appeal was heard a few days later and was also swiftly overturned . R v Raghip and others is regarded as a landmark ruling because it recognized that " interrogative suggestibility " might make a confession unreliable . 
 The court heard that Silcott 's interview notes were contaminated , and that Raghip 's suggestibility and Braithwaite 's having been denied a lawyer rendered their confessions unreliable . The Crown prosecutor , Roy <unk> , conceded that the apparent contamination rendered all three convictions unsafe : " [ W ] e would not have gone on against Braithwaite , against Raghip , against any other defendants , having learned of the apparent dishonesty of the officer in charge of the case . I say that because the Crown has to depend on the honesty and integrity of officers in a case ... The impact is obviously severe . " Rose writes that the statement was " one of the more sensational speeches in English legal history . " 
 Braithwaite and Raghip were released immediately . Silcott remained in jail for the 1984 murder of Anthony Smith . He received £ 17 @,@ 000 compensation in 1991 for his conviction in the Blakelock case , and in 1995 was offered up to £ 200 @,@ 000 in legal aid to sue the police for conspiracy to pervert the course of justice . The Metropolitan Police settled out of court in 1999 , awarding him £ 50 @,@ 000 for false imprisonment and malicious prosecution . He was released on licence in October 2003 having served 17 years for Smith 's murder . 
 = = Second investigation = = 
 = = = ( 1992 ) Commander Perry Nove = = = 
 A second criminal inquiry was opened in 1992 under Commander Perry Nove , who appealed for help from the local black community . In January 1993 the Crown Prosecution Service ( CPS ) drew a distinction between the " kickers and the <unk> , " those who had kicked or punched Blakelock and those who had used weapons ; the former could be called as witnesses in exchange for immunity from prosecution . By the end of 1993 , Rose writes , Nove had identified nine suspects against whom at least two eyewitnesses would testify , supported by evidence such as photographs . 
 The suspect list drawn up by Nove 's team included Nicholas Jacobs , who would be tried for the murder and acquitted in 2014 , based on the statements gathered during the second investigation . It transpired during Jacobs ' trial that two of the witnesses who testified against him had been paid expenses to the tune of thousands of pounds during Nove 's inquiry . 
 In parallel with the second investigation , a case was being prepared against Det Ch Supt Melvin and Det Insp Dingle . In July 1992 Melvin was charged with perjury and conspiracy to pervert the course of justice , and Dingle with conspiracy . In 1994 their lawyers applied for access to information from Nove 's inquiry , on the grounds that it might help their clients ; anything that implicated Winston Silcott would support the detectives ' contention that their interview notes were genuine and that Silcott really had , in effect , confessed . The lawyers also argued that the detectives should not be prosecuted until all related criminal proceedings had concluded . 
 Nove fought the application because he had promised his witnesses confidentiality , but he agreed to give the detectives ' lawyers access to relevant passages from seven statements that implicated Silcott . The witnesses refused to testify so the key passages from their statements were read out to the jury during the detectives ' trial . According to Rose , only one of the statements seriously implicated Silcott , alleging that he had acted " like a general , sending out his little troops , " and that he had joined in the attack himself . 
 The day before the detectives ' trial began in 1994 , the CPS announced that the nine suspects would not be prosecuted ; Rose writes that the CPS decided that a prosecution was not in the public interest . 
 = = = ( 1994 ) Trial : R v Melvin and Dingle = = = 
 The trial of Det Ch Supt Melvin and Det Insp Dingle opened in June 1994 at the Old Bailey before Mr. Justice Jowitt . Only three people had been present during the disputed interview with Silcott – Melvin , Dingle and Silcott himself – and none of them gave evidence . 
 David Calvert @-@ Smith , for the prosecution , alleged that the detectives ' supposedly contemporaneous notes of the fifth interview with Silcott had been altered after the fact to include the self @-@ incriminating remarks . Silcott had refused to answer questions during the first four interviews . During the fifth , when told there were witness statements that he had struck Blakelock with a machete or similar , the notes show him saying : " Those kids will never go to court . You wait and see . No one else will talk to you . You can 't keep me away from them . " Silcott denied ever having said these words . 
 Richard Ferguson QC , for the defence , argued that the ESDA test , which suggested that the disputed words had been added to the notes later , was not reliable . The defence also produced 14 witness statements from the two Blakelock inquiries , seven of them excerpts from Nove 's 1992 – 1994 inquiry and seven from the original investigation in 1985 , the latter read out to the jury as statements H to N. One of the 1985 statements said that Silcott had been carrying a knife with a two @-@ foot @-@ long blade on the night of the murder , and that he had attacked Blakelock . 
 Several of the statements originated from the juveniles who had been arrested shortly after the murder . They included Jason Hill , the 13 @-@ year @-@ old who had been held for three days in his underpants and a blanket , without access to his parents or a lawyer . ( Hill received £ 30 @,@ 000 in damages from the police over his treatment . ) Hill had not been told that his statement was going to be read out in court during the detectives ' trial ; he first learned that it had been used when he heard it on television . Another statement was from Mark Pennant , also a juvenile who had been arrested during the first inquiry . Overall it appeared that Silcott was being retried . 
 The detectives were acquitted on 26 July by a unanimous verdict . Both had been suspended during the case . Dingle retired immediately ; Melvin returned to work but retired three months later .

 = = = ( 2003 ) Detective Superintendent John Sweeney = = = 
 In March 1999 the Metropolitan Police included Blakelock 's killing in a review of 300 unsolved murders in London going back to 1984 , when details were first recorded on computer . In December 2003 , weeks after Silcott was released from jail after serving 17 years for the murder of Anthony Smith , police announced that the Blakelock investigation had been re @-@ opened , and would be led by Det Supt John Sweeney . 
 Detectives began re @-@ examining 10 @,@ 000 witness statements , and submitting items for forensic tests not available in 1985 . In September 2004 the back garden of a terraced council house in Willan Road , near the Broadwater Farm estate , was excavated after a tip @-@ off . A female friend of Cynthia Jarrett , the woman whose death sparked the Broadwater Farm riot , lived alone at the house between 1984 and 1989 , and according to the Evening Standard was one of the first on the scene when police raided Jarrett 's house . 
 Archaeologists dug up the garden , while surveyors used infra @-@ red beams to create a three @-@ dimensional map of the area . A machete was found and sent for forensic tests . Police also searched the garden for Blakelock 's truncheon and helmet . In October 2004 his overalls were retrieved from Scotland Yard 's Crime Museum for DNA tests . Nothing was found that could be used as evidence . 
 = = = ( 2013 ) Nicholas Jacobs = = = 
 Six years later , between February and October 2010 , 10 men between the ages of 42 and 52 were arrested on suspicion of Blakelock 's murder . The first to be arrested , in February , was Nicholas Jacobs , who had been questioned in 1985 and sentenced to six years for affray . In October that year , to mark the 25th anniversary , the BBC 's Crimewatch staged a reconstruction and appealed for information . 
 In July 2013 the Crown Prosecution Service announced that , although suspicions remained about six of those arrested , no action would be taken against five of them because of insufficient evidence . The remaining suspect , Nicholas " Nicky " Conrad Jacobs , sixteen years old at the time of the riot , was charged with Blakelock 's murder that month and was remanded in custody . He pleaded not guilty in November 2013 . 
 Jacobs was living with his mother in Manor Road , Tottenham , at the time of the riot . He had spent time in a residential school in Reading , and in 1985 joined a Tottenham gang , the Park Lane Crew . He was named shortly after the riot by two of those arrested , and was arrested himself five days later on suspicion of murder . The police had a photograph of him from the night carrying a petrol bomb and a container of rocks , though he told them he had first arrived at the estate after midnight , two hours after Blakelock was killed . In the end he was charged with affray , and in November 1986 was sentenced to eight years by Judge Neil Denison ( the longest sentence handed out for affray during the riot , according to Rose ) , reduced on appeal to six years . Jacobs was one of nine suspects that the Crown Prosecution Service decided not to charge with Blakelock 's murder at the conclusion of Commander Perry Nove 's 1992 – 1994 inquiry . 
 = = = ( 2014 ) Trial : R v Jacobs = = = 
 The trial of Nicholas Jacobs opened before Mr Justice Nicol at the Old Bailey on 3 March 2014 . Jacobs did not take the stand . He was found not guilty on 9 April 2014 by a 10 – 2 verdict . 
 The court heard that , in 1988 while Jacobs was serving his sentence for affray , a guard found rap lyrics in his cell , in Jacobs ' handwriting , that described Blakelock 's killing : " we start chop him on his hand we chop him on him finger we chop him on him leg we chop him on his shoulder him head him chest him neck .. " The defence responded that Bob Marley had not been prosecuted for " I Shot the Sheriff . " The court was also told that , when Jacobs was arrested for a separate offence in May 2000 , by then aged 30 , he reportedly told an officer : " F * * * off , I was one of them who killed PC Blakelock , " which the defence called a " flippant street remark . " 
 The main prosecution witnesses were three pseudonymous men who testified from behind a curtain with their voices distorted . Two of them , " John Brown " and " Rhodes Levin , " had offered testimony to Nove during his 1992 – 1994 investigation ; the third , " witness Q , " was Brown 's cousin . Richard <unk> QC , for the prosecution , told the court that all three had admitted kicking or hitting Blakelock , and would normally be facing murder charges themselves , but the CPS had decided during Nove 's inquiry to offer the " kickers " immunity in exchange for testimony against the " <unk> " in the hope of gaining a conviction . 
 John Brown was 20 at the time of the attack and served a sentence for affray for his role in the rioting . He was a member of the Park Lane Crew , a Tottenham gang that he said Jacobs had also joined . Approached by police again during Nove 's second inquiry , Brown said in a statement in August 1993 that Jacobs was a " nutter " who was " out to get blood " that night . He said Jacobs had " broadcast it everywhere that he was going to try and do a copper , " and that the Park Lane Crew had stored weapons and petrol bombs in preparation for such an attack . Brown admitted to having kicked Blakelock up to ten times , and said that he had seen Jacobs attack Blakelock with a machete or similar . 
 The police gave Brown £ 5 @,@ 000 in 1993 and an additional £ 590 in January 2011 toward his rent ; they also paid for credits for his mobile phone so that they could reach him , and paid to have his car put through an MOT test ( an annual <unk> test ) . The court heard that Brown had also been also " made aware " by police that the Sun newspaper had offered a £ 100 @,@ 000 reward . He told the police in 1993 that he had difficulty identifying black people : " I can 't tell the difference between them . To me a black man is a black man . " 
 The second witness , Rhodes Levin , had also served a sentence for affray for his role in the riots , and had a history of using cocaine , crack cocaine and heroin . He admitted to having kicked Blakelock several times . He said that Jacobs had been carrying a lock @-@ knife with a brown handle and six @-@ inch ( 15 cm ) blade that night ( Blakelock was found with a six @-@ inch blade with a wooden handle embedded in his neck up to the hilt ) . Afterwards , Levin said , Jacobs told him he had " got a couple of <unk> [ stabs ] in . " Levin also said that Blakelock 's helmet had been passed around as a trophy , though he could not recall the names of those who had handled it . 
 Levin was interviewed by police in November 1985 , when he said Winston Silcott had led the attack with a machete ; he told the court in 2014 that that had been a mistake . The court heard that , during Nove 's 1992 – 1994 investigation , police offered Levin immunity from prosecution , gave him £ 5 @,@ 000 and paid for a flight from Spain when he missed his flight home from a holiday . They approached him again in January 2008 for his testimony and helped him with expenses and a deposit for accommodation . 
 Q , the third witness , first told police in 2009 that he had seen the attack , after they posted a note through his letterbox asking for witnesses . The court heard that Q had a long history of using drugs and alcohol . He said he had known Jacobs all his life and had seen him attack Blakelock with a " mini sword " or similar , making " repeated stabbing motions " toward Blakelock . Courtenay Griffiths QC , for the defence , told the court that Q was a <unk> . He was unable to describe accurately where the attack had taken place . 
 = = Awards , memorial , and 2011 riots = = 
 Because it had not been clear who was in charge of the police operation on the night of Blakelock 's death , a new " gold – silver – bronze command structure " ( strategic – tactical – operational ) was created in 1985 that replaced ranks with roles . It is now used by all UK emergency services at every type of major incident . 
 In 1988 the constables of Serial 502 were awarded the Queen 's Gallantry Medal , Blakelock posthumously . Sgt David Pengelly , who single @-@ handedly fought to hold the crowd away from Blakelock and Richard Coombes after they fell , received the George Medal , awarded for acts of great bravery . A memorial for Blakelock , commissioned by the Police Memorial Trust , stands by the roundabout at Muswell Hill , north London , where he was a <unk> officer . 
 Rebel MC 's 1992 single The Governments Fail focuses on the Blakelock case . 
 Rioting broke out in Tottenham again in August 2011 , after the police shot and killed a local man , Mark Duggan ( 1981 – 2011 ) , believing that he was armed . Violence and looting spread throughout England for several days , leading to five deaths and thousands of arrests . 
 = Swedbank Stadion = 
 The Swedbank Stadion , often called Stadion , is a football stadium in Malmö , Sweden and the home of Allsvenskan club Malmö <unk> , commonly known as Malmö FF . In UEFA competitions , the stadium is known as Malmö New Stadium for sponsorship reasons . The stadium is named after Swedish based banking group Swedbank , which owns its naming rights . Apart from being the home of Malmö FF , Swedbank Stadion has also hosted senior and youth international matches . 
 The stadium is the third largest used by a Swedish football club , behind AIK 's Friends Arena and Djurgårdens IF 's and Hammarby IF 's <unk> Arena , both located in Stockholm . In league matches , the stadium has a capacity of 24 @,@ 000 , of which 18 @,@ 000 are seated , and 6 @,@ 000 are standing . In European matches , the 6 @,@ 000 standing places are converted to 3 @,@ 000 seats , making the stadium a 21 @,@ 000 @-@ capacity all @-@ seater . Swedbank Stadion opened in April 2009 , and replaced Malmö Stadion , where Malmö FF had been based since 1958 . The new ground was originally budgeted to cost 398 million kronor , but ultimately cost 695 million kronor ( € 79 @.@ 7 ) . It is a UEFA category 4 @-@ rated stadium , and is thus able to host all UEFA club competition matches , except for finals . The ground 's record attendance , 24 @,@ 148 , was set in an Allsvenskan match between Malmö FF and Mjällby AIF on 7 November 2010 : in this match , Malmö FF won 2 – 0 and clinched that year 's national championship . 
 = = History = = 
 Malmö FF 's board of directors initiated the search for a new stadium in the mid @-@ 1990s . Malmö Stadion , where Malmö FF had played since its construction in 1958 , was starting to deteriorate by this time , and was also too large for the club , which often struggled to fill it for Allsvenskan matches . In 1995 , club chairman Bengt Madsen began to raise money for the renovation of Malmö IP , the club 's former home between 1910 and 1957 , into a modern football stadium . Malmö IP was practical and economical for the club as it was already an extant site , and was smaller than Malmö Stadion , which was expensive to maintain . The renovation of Malmö IP was finished in August 1999 , and Malmö FF moved in soon after . However , the renovated ground failed to live up to expectations , proving to be very basic by modern standards ; the paltry capacity of 7 @,@ 600 was also deemed a security issue . The club therefore moved back to Malmö Stadion in 2001 . 
 The club 's directors now considered constructing an entirely new stadium in Malmö . Plans for such a ground were first mooted in 2001 , but were not fully considered until the end of 2004 , when the team won Allsvenskan for the first time since 1989 . Malmö Municipality announced on 25 April 2005 its intention to either help the club renovate Malmö Stadion , or build a new stadium in the same area . Four days later , five different scenarios were laid out by the City of Malmö : the first proposed the construction of an entirely new , football @-@ specific stadium to the south of Malmö Stadion , while the second suggested the demolition of Malmö Stadion , and the erection of a new ground for football and athletics on the same site . The third , fourth , and fifth ideas all proposed the building of two stadiums , one for football and one for athletics , on various local plots . The municipality chose the first option on 3 December 2005 : the new football ground would be built south of Malmö Stadion , with a capacity of 20 @,@ 000 to 25 @,@ 000 , on a 399 million kronor budget . Malmö Stadion , meanwhile , would be renovated into an athletics stadium for 50 million kronor . 
 Construction of the new stadium commenced on 23 April 2007 , with the first sod being turned by Malmö FF chairman Bengt Madsen , Malmö Municipality chairman <unk> <unk> , club captain Daniel Andersson , and two former players : Daniel 's brother Patrik , and their father Roy . The ground was designed by <unk> Arkitekter , in collaboration with Berg Arkitektkontor , which also designed Friends Arena , the Swedish national stadium , which is in Solna . The main constructor for the new Malmö FF stadium was Peab . Its budget was ultimately heavily exceeded : Peab announced in 2009 that it would cost 695 million kronor instead of the original 399 million . The extra amount was explained as being down to miscalculations in the original budget , as well as additions made to the plans since the start of construction , which Peab reasoned made the original budget no longer entirely valid . Malmö FF announced on 12 July 2007 that they had sold the naming rights for the stadium to Swedish bank Swedbank , for a ten @-@ year period , starting on the ground 's opening . Between 2009 and 2013 the naming rights to stands inside the stadium were sold to different sponsors . At the start of the 2014 season the sponsor names of the stands were removed and the advertisement placements in front of each stand were sold to the club 's largest sponsors . The graphical profile of the advertisement was also given a light blue background with white text to adhere to the club 's colours . The ground 's inauguration game was played several months before , on 13 April 2009 , against Örgryte IS . Malmö FF won the game 3 – 0 , and the first goal was scored by midfielder Labinot <unk> . All facilities related to football were completed by this time , but the office space and some exterior work was yet to be done . This was finished in late 2009 . The completed building was 27 meters tall , 150 meters wide , and 215 meters in length . 
 On 9 May 2009 , weeks after the stadium opened , part of the ground 's away section was earmarked for conversion into terracing . This was because of high demand from away supporters , who had previously had to pay for a seating ticket , even though they preferred to stand . Even before this remodelling was complete , Malmö FF lowered the away ticket prices to match the price of a home terracing ticket . This restructuring was completed before the 2010 season . The terracing for the home supporters was also modified to ease mobility , and combat safety issues in the stands . The old pitch was removed and a new one was installed in preparation for the 2015 Allsvenskan season . The new surface was produced from the same Dutch grass producer who will provide the pitch for the 2015 UEFA Champions League Final at Olympiastadion Berlin . UEFA had previously criticized the surface at the stadium following the 2014 – 15 UEFA Champions League group stage . 
 = = Structure and facilities = = 
 Swedbank Stadion has an overall capacity of 24 @,@ 000 spectators . It comprises four stands : the Western Stand ; the Eastern Stand and the Southern Stand , both of which have two tiers ; and the Northern Stand , which is terraced . The lower @-@ right part of the Southern Stand also features terracing for away supporters , but the rest of the stand is seated . The lower tier has 10 @,@ 000 seats , and the upper tier has 8 @,@ 000 seats . The Northern Stand has a capacity of 6 @,@ 000 standing supporters , which can be transformed into an all @-@ seated section with a capacity of 3 @,@ 000 if required . This is done for matches played by Malmö FF in Europe . 
 The Northern Stand holds the most season ticket @-@ holders . It is a single @-@ tier terracing section , with railing in various places across the stand for security and comfort . It can hold up to 100 wheelchair users and their companions in a dedicated section . The stand also houses conference facilities with views of the pitch , as well as the 2 @,@ 000 @-@ capacity " <unk> 1910 " in the inside area , behind the terraced area of the stand , and a health club run by <unk> & <unk> . Malmö FF 's official souvenir shop is on the outside of the stand , alongside an O <unk> sports bar , which holds up to 250 guests . The Eastern and Western Stands house 54 VIP boxes between them , which is more than any other football stadium in Sweden . Including all sports , is the second most after the multi @-@ purpose indoor arena Malmö Arena , which has 72 boxes . The Eastern and Western Stands also have 2 @,@ 000 club seats along their upper tiers . These seats are more comfortable than the regular seats , and come with half @-@ time meals and snacks in " <unk> 1910 " . The Western Stand includes seating for the press , as well as a large press room inside the stand . The president 's box , which holds up to 60 people , is also in the Western Stand . 
 There are 24 vending stands in the corridor area behind the stands , with a selection of different snacks , light meals , and beverages . Other facilities include exhibition space , 330 toilets for men , 120 for women , and six for the disabled . Pre @-@ match and half @-@ time activities take place behind the terracing of the Northern Stand . This area is called Ståplatstorget ( " The terracing square " ) , and includes eight vending stands and MFF Support 's supporter centre . At the supporter centre , fans can buy souvenirs , and tickets to away matches . The square also contains publicly accessible benches and tables . Access between the different areas of the stadium was limited by a system of security gates until the end of the 2011 season , when Malmö FF announced that supporters would be able to roam the stadium freely , except for the areas occupied by away supporters . This was done to create a more free and friendly atmosphere , and to encourage fans to arrive earlier for matches . To further motivate spectators to come early , pre @-@ match activities are often held at Ståplatstorget . 
 The lower tier of the Southern Stand is reserved for away supporters , with most of the stand being seated . The western part of the stand , however , is converted into terracing for domestic league games . The area reserved for away supporters varies from game to game depending on how many away fans are expecting : the allocation 's size is altered by restricting access to and from the area with large safety nets , which are laid across the seating and supervised by stewards . The away section is small for most Allsvenskan matches , with the most notable exceptions being matches against Helsingborgs IF , AIK , Djurgårdens IF , and IFK Göteborg . These matches tend to draw larger away attendances , and the away area is therefore accordingly expanded across the entire lower tier of the Southern Stand . 
 In tribute to former manager Roy Hodgson and his successful time at Malmö , the club 's fans have unofficially named the upper corner of the Eastern Stand closest to the Northern Stand " Roy 's <unk> " ( Roy 's Corner ) . The corresponding corner of the Western Stand on the other side of the Northern Stand is named " Bob 's <unk> " ( Bob 's Corner ) in tribute to Bob Houghton . These sections are known as " <unk> <unk> " ( Singing seating ) since the two sections are fitted with seats but where the majority of the spectators are standing fans that sings in correlation with the fans on the terracing at the Northern Stand between the two sections . Both Hodgson and Houghton had successful managerial careers at Malmö FF , they both won multiple league and cup titles while at the club .
