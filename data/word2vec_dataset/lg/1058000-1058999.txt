 The third generation MacBook Pro received positive reviews of the Retina Display , flash storage and power . It was criticized , however , for its high price and lack of an Ethernet port and optical drive . Roman Loyola of Macworld said that the Retina MacBook Pro was " groundbreaking " and made people " rethink how they use technology . " He praised the inclusion of USB 3 @.@ 0 and the slimmer body . Dan Ackerman of CNET commented " I 've previously called the 15 @-@ inch MacBook Pro one of the most universally useful all @-@ around laptops you can buy . This new version adds to that with HDMI , faster ports , and more portability . But it also subtracts from that with its exclusion of an optical drive and Ethernet port , plus its very high starting price . The Pro and Retina Pro are clearly two laptops designed for two different users , and with the exception of all @-@ day commuters who need something closer to a MacBook Air or ultrabook , one of the two branches of the MacBook Pro family tree is still probably the most universally useful laptop you can buy . " 
 Joel Santo Domingo of PC Magazine gave the MacBook Pro an " Editor 's Choice " rating . He praised " brilliant Retina display " the thin design , port selection and speedy storage , and highlighted the expandability via Thunderbolt ports which support up to seven devices each . David Pogue of The New York Times praised the 15 @-@ inch model 's screen , keyboard , sound , start @-@ up time , cosmetics , battery life , storage , and RAM capacity . They criticized the lack of a SuperDrive , pricing , and the MagSafe 2 power connector 's lack of backwards compatibility with the older MagSafe design . 
 Since the battery is glued in and cannot be easily disassembled for recycling ( an <unk> requirement ) , Apple received criticisms about the machine 's ability to be recycled . Greenpeace spokesman Casey Harrell said Apple " has pitted design against the environment — and chosen design . They 're making a big bet that people don 't care , but recycling is a big issue . " Wired also criticized Apple 's recyclability claims , stating " [ t ] he design may well be comprised of ' highly recyclable aluminum and glass ' — but my friends in the electronics recycling industry tell me they have no way of recycling aluminum that has glass glued to it like Apple did with both this machine and the recent iPad . " 
 The Retina Display on the MacBook Pro have been criticized for " image retention , " specifically for displays manufactured by LG .

 The OS X operating system has been pre @-@ installed on all MacBook Pros since release , starting with version 10 @.@ 4 @.@ 4 ( Tiger ) . Along with OS X , iLife has also shipped with all systems , beginning with iLife ' 06 . 
 The MacBook Pro comes with the successor to BIOS , Extensible Firmware Interface ( EFI ) 1 @.@ 1 . EFI handles booting differently from BIOS @-@ based computers , but provides backwards compatibility , allowing dual and triple boot configurations . In addition to OS X , the Microsoft Windows operating system is <unk> on Intel x86 @-@ based Apple computers . Officially , this is limited to both 32 @-@ bit and 64 @-@ bit versions of Windows XP , Vista , 7 , 8 , and 10 with the necessary hardware drivers included with the Boot Camp software . Other x86 operating systems such as Linux are also unofficially supported . This is made possible by the presence of the Intel architecture as provided by the CPU and the BIOS emulation Apple has provided on top of EFI . 
 As the MacBook Pro uses a different hardware platform than earlier PowerPC ( PPC ) -based Macintoshes , versions of OS X prior to Lion can run PPC applications only via the Rosetta emulator , which exacts some performance penalty , cannot emulate some lower @-@ level PPC code , and does not support 64 @-@ bit ( G5 specific ) PPC features . Rosetta is not present in Lion and later , so PPC applications cannot be run under those versions of OS X.

 = Hochtief = 
 Hochtief Aktiengesellschaft is a German construction company based in Essen , North Rhine @-@ Westphalia , Germany . Hochtief is Germany 's largest construction company and operates globally , ranking as one of the largest general construction companies in the United States through its Turner subsidiary , and in Australia through a 53 @.@ 43 % shareholding in <unk> Group . In 2010 it employed more than 70 @,@ 000 employees across five corporate divisions . One of these , Hochtief Concessions , is a major airport operator . The others are involved with construction project planning , finance , construction and operation . Work done in 2010 was € 23 @.@ 23 billion , with more than 80 % coming from operations outside Germany . 
 The company 's history dates back to 1874 and includes engineering feats such as the transplantation of the Abu Simbel rock temples in Egypt ( saving them from the rise of the River Nile caused by the Aswan High Dam ) , and infrastructure projects like the new Athens International Airport and Germany 's first nuclear power plant . It is also noted for its involvement with the Bauhaus movement , particularly for its work at Zollverein colliery and the reconstruction of the Kandinsky @-@ Klee house in Dessau ; both World Heritage Sites . During World War II it deployed forced labor on construction projects . It built the Führerbunker in Berlin , the scene of Adolf Hitler 's suicide , as well as Hitler 's home in Berghof and the Wolfsschanze headquarters . More recent constructions have included Bosphorus Bridge ( Turkey ) , King Abdulaziz International Airport ( Saudi Arabia ) , and the Messeturm and Commerzbank Tower in Frankfurt . 
 In late 2010 , Spanish construction company Grupo ACS , which already owned a 30 percent stake of Hochtief , launched a bid that would allow ACS to acquire an additional 20 percent stake of Hochtief . The bid was approved by the German Federal Financial Supervisory Authority ( <unk> ) on 29 November 2010 . ACS increased its stake in Hochtief to 50 @.@ 16 percent in June 2011 , effectively taking over control of Hochtief .

 The company was probably founded in 1874 ( its first mention in the local address book ) as Gebrüder Helfmann , <unk> by the <unk> @-@ born brothers Philipp and Balthasar Helfmann , a lumber merchant and mechanic respectively , in <unk> near Frankfurt am Main . While Balthasar focused on the completion of construction contracts , Philipp developed the financing side of the business . Their first major contract was for the University of Giessen in 1878 . By the 1880s the company had begun to produce its own construction materials but was still only a regional player . Shortly after the death of Balthasar , Philipp converted the company into a joint stock corporation , Aktiengesellschaft für Hoch- und <unk> ( " Construction and Civil Engineering Corporation " , though literally the " Corporation for High - Hoch and Deep - Tief Construction - <unk> ) . A major development was the contract for the spa project in Bad Orb in 1899 , with the corporation not simply erecting buildings but also to provide infrastructure like roads and gardens , to arrange the finances for the project , and to maintain some responsibilities for operating the project after its construction . Also in 1899 , another turnkey project , a new grain silo in Genoa , Italy , was both the firm 's first international venture and its first project using reinforced concrete . Philipp Helfmann died in the same year , with his son @-@ in @-@ law , Hans Weidmann , taking over as Chief Executive . 
 = = = After the Helfmann brothers = = = 
 The firm grew rapidly , but was not comparable with the major German construction concerns of the era . In 1921 it attracted investment from the industrialist Hugo Stinnes ( described by Time as the " New Emperor of Germany " for his wealth and influence ) and in 1922 the firm moved its base to Essen as part of its integration into the Stinnes group . Stinnes planned to use Hochtief for all his construction projects , while the Hochtief saw an opportunity to profit from the Treaty of Versailles , organising the delivery of construction materials to France as part of German reparations for World War I. Fate intervened as Stinnes died in 1924 and within a year his industrial empire collapsed , while the French occupation of the Ruhr destroyed the chance to profit from the reparations contract that had been made with the French industrialist Guy Louis Jean de <unk> . With the help of several banks , the company ( now known as Hochtief Aktiengesellschaft für Hoch- und <unk> <unk> . Gebrüder Helfmann ) avoided insolvency . In the aftermath of the Stinnes collapse , the major utility RWE and electrical equipment producer AEG became major share @-@ holders in Hochtief , and Hans Weidmann stepped down in 1927 . 
 A series of major construction projects ensued , including the Echelsbach Bridge ( then Germany 's largest single span reinforced concrete bridge ) , the Schluchsee dam and work at the Zollverein colliery . The Zollverein architects Fritz <unk> and Martin <unk> seem to be influenced by the Bauhaus , one of the reasons the complex became a UNESCO World Heritage Site . The iconic Shaft 12 at the colliery was named after Albert Vögler , CEO of the Vereinigte <unk> AG , which was owner of the colliery since 1926 . There was also canal work : the Moselle Canal in France and the Albert Canal in Belgium . 
 = = = From Nazi Germany to Reconstruction = = = 
 Under the Third Reich , Jewish members of the Supervisory Board were expelled under the Nuremberg Laws in 1935 . The CEO , Eugen Vögler , did not join the Nazi party until 1937 , however , he did offer his services to the Nazis as leader of the " Construction Industry Business Group " and took a position in the Hitler Youth . The construction business flourished under the Four year plan , with its vast public works programme , including the Autobahn network , and the industrial build @-@ up in preparation for war , for example the construction of a new truck factory for Opel in <unk> . Hochtief also worked on a new centre for Nazi rallies in Nuremberg . In 1936 it moved its Essen headquarters from the <unk> to its current location in <unk> Straße . As war became imminent , the company began work on the Westwall defensive network . During World War II , it later worked on the Atlantic Wall defences , and a range of infrastructure projects across German @-@ dominated Europe . Hochtief also constructed buildings for Hitler himself , notably his Bavarian Alpine retreat , the Berghof , his Wolf 's Lair headquarters in Rastenburg , and the Führerbunker in Berlin , where Hitler ultimately committed suicide . 
 After 1939 the firm began to use forced labour extensively on its projects , as did many other German industrial concerns at the time . Hochtief 's slave workers suffered from malnutrition , beating and constant abuse . The consortium @-@ led nature of construction projects obscures the firm 's exact involvement , as does the destruction of many records . 
 During the closing stages of the war , most of the company 's branch offices were destroyed , and employees in the East fled the Soviet advance . The head office in Essen suffered a direct hit from a bomb in March 1945 , and regional offices and construction centres in Danzig , Halle , Katowice , Königsberg , Kraków , Leipzig and Magdeburg were lost as the territory they were in was allotted to Poland or the Soviet Zone of occupation . As Eugen Vögler was on the run from the new authorities , he was replaced as CEO by Artur Konrad . 
 During the initial post @-@ war period , a shortage of machinery , tools , and materials , as well as a dearth of new orders , hampered operations . Some salvage work occurred , as well as rubble @-@ clearance and basic repairs . One of the first , rare , major contracts was for a university hospital in Bonn , 1946 @-@ 49 . The introduction of the German mark in 1948 and the beginning of the <unk> brought more new work . 
 = = = Revival and international expansion = = = 
 Josef Müller took over as CEO in 1950 . A decision was taken to undertake more international projects , following a period of essentially domestic work after World War II . This included a series of power infrastructure works in Turkey and bridge and smelting works construction in Egypt during the early 1950s . It is interesting to note that many projects from this period were undertaken outside of the First World ; many were funded from development aid budgets . 
 A high profile success for the company came in the 1960s , again in Egypt . The rising waters of the River Nile ( a result of the construction of the Aswan High Dam ) threatened the ancient Abu Simbel temple complex . The entire site was dismantled and reassembled 200 m further from the river , and 65 m higher , at a cost of around US $ 36 million . 
 The focus of the company began to switch away from purely construction and towards more turnkey work and service provision , for example the 1961 @-@ 3 Hilton Hotel , Athens , project . Most work was domestic , driven by Germany 's strong economic growth , with a particular strength in power plant construction . This included the construction of the Federal Republic of Germany 's first nuclear power plant , Kahl Nuclear Power Plant , near Dettingen am Main . The construction contract had been awarded by AEG , which had been commissioned by the utility company RWE to build the plant . The plant began to feed its electricity to the grid in June 1961 . By contrast , the first East German nuclear plant , at <unk> , was connected to the grid in 1966 . 
 There was also considerable transport infrastructure activity , including on the <unk> <unk> Tunnel , Argentina in the 1960s and the New Elbe Tunnel in Hamburg in the 1970s 
 By the mid @-@ 1970s , foreign work ( such as the Bosporus Bridge in Turkey , completed 1974 ) was accelerating while domestic orders were receding , according to the company 's annual report of 1975 . By 1980 , foreign work accounted for more than 50 % of Hochtief 's business . A major factor was the contract for King Abdulaziz International Airport ( completed 1981 ) , the largest airport in Saudi Arabia , and the most valuable contract Hochtief had ever been involved with . The architecture of the airport is highly rated aesthetically , and it has several unusual features , including Terminal Three , used only during the Hajj , reserved for pilgrims travelling to Mecca . It has a tent @-@ shaped fibreglass roof , contains a mosque , can accommodate 80 @,@ 000 travellers at once , and is believed to be the largest terminal in the world . 
 The 1980s were a difficult time financially , with less foreign work coming through ; though they headed the consortium that built the Mosul Dam in Iraq from 1981 @-@ 84 . There was domestic growth , highlighted by the architecturally radical Messe <unk> in Frankfurt , completed in 1984 . It was later involved in the construction of the Messeturm in the same city ; once completed in 1991 it was Europe 's tallest building . In the mid @-@ 1990s , Hochtief was involved in yet another major skyscraper development in Frankfurt , the Commerzbank Tower , which overtook the Messeturm to become Europe 's tallest building , losing the record to Triumph @-@ Palace in Moscow in 2003 . 
 The 1990s brought an opportunity to expand operations in the airport management sector , as many countries privatised their airports . When Warsaw Frederic Chopin Airport needed upgrading in the early 1990s , LOT Polish Airlines was unable to afford the cost , so a complex financing arrangement was established whereby a bank would pay Hochtief two thirds of the costs to upgrade the airport , while the airline assigned to the bank the revenues from aircraft using Polish airspace for a period . The company began to take responsibility for more operational aspects of projects , including service provision , financing , facility management and software development , following a concept of being a " system leader " , as set out by CEO Hans @-@ Peter Keitel . These tasks were felt to be higher up the value chain , and would help the firm shake off the slowdown that had followed the initial boom of German reunification . These concepts were notably put into action during the construction of the new Athens International Airport in the late 1990s . 
 In 1999 , Hochtief made big inroads into the United States market through its merger with Turner Corporation , while in 2000 it celebrated its 125th anniversary . A part of those celebrations was the DM 1 million donation to the restoration of the Kandinsky @-@ Klee House in Dessau , a project for which it was the general contractor . The house had been used by the Bauhaus movement as an example of a " <unk> " , but Nazi persecution of the Bauhaus , and subsequent neglect , had left significant damage . The house was re @-@ opened on 4 February 2000 , after a two @-@ year restoration programme . It forms part of the UNESCO Bauhaus World Heritage Site . 
 In May 2013 , Hochtief sold its airports division to Canada 's Public Sector Pension Investment Board for 1 @.@ 1 billion euros .

 The Culinary Institute of America ( CIA ) is an American private not @-@ for @-@ profit college specializing in culinary and baking and pastry arts education . The CIA 's primary campus is located in Hyde Park , New York , with branch campuses in St. Helena , California , San Antonio , Texas , and the Republic of Singapore . The college offers associate and bachelor 's degrees , and has the largest staff of American Culinary Federation Certified Master Chefs . The CIA also offers continuing education for professionals in the hospitality industry as well as conferences and consulting services . In addition to professional education , the college also offers recreational classes for non @-@ professionals . The college operates student @-@ run restaurants on their three U.S. campuses . The school colors ( green and gold ) refer to the school 's mission to sustain the environment and to strive for excellence . 
 The school was founded in 1946 in New Haven , Connecticut as a vocational institute for returning veterans of World War II . With a growing student body , the school purchased a former Jesuit novitiate in Hyde Park in 1970 , which remains its central campus . The school began awarding associate degrees in 1971 and bachelor 's degrees in 1993 . The school opened its California campus in 1995 , its Texas campus in 2008 , and its Singapore campus in 2010 .

 The New Haven Restaurant Institute was founded by culinary educator Frances Roth and Katherine Angell ( wife of James Rowland Angell ) on May 22 , 1946 in New Haven , Connecticut as a vocational training school for returning World War II veterans . With assistance from Yale University , the school purchased the Davies mansion in New Haven 's Prospect Hill neighborhood . The building , later known as Angell Hall , was joined by the adjacent Taft Mansion , now demolished . The first class consisted of sixteen students and the faculty included a dietitian , a baker , and a chef . In 1947 the school was renamed the Restaurant Institute of Connecticut to reflect its growing repute ; the school 's name was changed again to the Culinary Institute of America in 1951 . 
 Enrollment grew to approximately 1 @,@ 000 students by 1969 , beyond the capacity of its original campus , so the school purchased the St. Andrew @-@ on @-@ Hudson Jesuit novitiate in Hyde Park , New York in 1970 . In 1971 , the college began awarding associate degrees . The following year , it began operating at the Hyde Park location . From 1974 to 1979 , the school built three residence halls , a culinary library , a career planning center , and a learning resources center . From 1982 to 1984 , the American Bounty and Caterina de ' Medici Restaurants and St. Andrew 's Café opened . In 1984 , the school 's continuing education center ( later named the J. Willard Marriott Education Center ) opened , and the school improved its teaching kitchens and constructed an experimental kitchen and food laboratory . In 1990 , the school opened a baking and pastry facility , named two years later as the Shunsuke Takaki School of Baking and Pastry . In 1993 , the school opened its Conrad N. Hilton Library and began offering bachelor 's degree programs . In 1995 , the school 's first branch campus opened , the Culinary Institute of America at Greystone in St. Helena , California . In 1998 , the Student Recreation Center was opened . 
 The Apple Pie Bakery Café opened in 2000 , and the <unk> Center opened the following year . More residence halls were built at the school 's Hyde Park campus in 2004 . In 2005 , Anton Plaza opened in Hyde Park while the Ventura Center for Menu Research and Development opened in St. Helena . The school 's third campus opened in 2008 in San Antonio . Two years later , the CIA opened a campus in Singapore consisting of a facility on the campus of Temasek Polytechnic . In 2012 , the CIA began offering a bachelor 's degree program in culinary science , and in 2014 introduced a bachelor 's degree in applied food studies . Also , in 2012 the college was inducted into the Culinary Hall of Fame . In 2015 , the college expanded its recreation center and added a new dining facility for students , called The Egg . Both are housed in the CIA 's Student Commons building . In the same year , the college acquired a portion of Copia , a museum in downtown Napa , California that operated from 2001 to 2008 . As of 2016 the college is opening a campus , the Culinary Institute of America at Copia , which will house the CIA 's new Food Business School .

 The ARF idea of " United Armenia " incorporates claims to Western Armenia ( eastern Turkey ) , Nagorno @-@ Karabakh ( Artsakh ) , the landlocked exclave Nakhichevan of Azerbaijan and the Javakheti ( Javakhk ) region of Georgia . Nagorno @-@ Karabakh and Javakhk are overwhelmingly inhabited by Armenians . Western Armenia and Nakhichevan had significant Armenian populations in the early 20th century , but no longer do . The Armenian population of eastern Turkey was almost completely exterminated during the genocide of 1915 , when the millennia @-@ long Armenian presence in the area largely ended and Armenian cultural heritage was mainly destroyed by the Turkish government . In 1919 the ARF @-@ dominated government of the First Republic of Armenia declared the formal unification of Armenian lands . The ARF bases its claims to Turkey on the 1920 Treaty of Sèvres , which was effectively negated by subsequent historical events . The territorial claims to Turkey are often seen as the ultimate goal of the recognition of the Armenian Genocide and the hypothetical reparations of the genocide . 
 The most recent Armenian irredentist movement , the Karabakh movement that began in 1988 , sought to unify Nagorno @-@ Karabakh with then @-@ Soviet Armenia . As a result of the subsequent war with Azerbaijan , the Armenian forces have established effective control over most of Nagorno @-@ Karabakh and the surrounding districts , thus succeeding in de facto unification of Armenia and Karabakh . Some Armenian nationalists consider Nagorno @-@ Karabakh " the first stage of a United Armenia . "

 = = = Origins = = = 
 The term " United Armenia " was created during the Armenian national awakening in the second half of the 19th century . During this period , the Armenian @-@ populated areas were divided between the Russian Empire ( Eastern Armenia ) and the Ottoman Empire ( Western Armenia ) . One of the earliest uses of the phrase " United Armenia " is by the English Society of Friends of Russian Freedom in an 1899 edition of Free Russia monthly . It quotes a confidential report of Grigory Golitsin ( the Russian governor of the Caucasus ) sent to tsar Nicholas II " containing suggestions for a future policy . " Golitsin is convinced that there exists a nationalist movement which " aims at the restoration of the independent Armenia of the past . " Golitsin writes that " their ideal is one great and united Armenia . " 
 The idea of an independent and united Armenia was the main goal of the Armenian national liberation movement during the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries . By the 1890s , a low @-@ intensity armed conflict developed between the three major Armenian parties — the Armenian Revolutionary Federation ( Dashnak ) , <unk> and <unk> — and the Ottoman government . Calls from the great powers for reforms in the Armenian provinces and Armenian aspirations of independence resulted in the Hamidian massacres between 1894 and 1896 , during which up to 300 @,@ 000 Armenian civilians were slaughtered by the order of Sultan Abdul Hamid II , after whom the massacres were named . After the 1908 Young Turk Revolution , some Armenians felt that the situation would improve ; however , a year later the Adana massacre took place and Turkish @-@ Armenian relations deteriorated further . After the Balkan Wars of 1912 – 1913 , the Ottoman government was pushed to accept the reforms in the Armenian provinces in early 1914 . 
 = = = World War I and the Armenian Genocide = = = 
 The Armenians of eastern Ottoman Empire were exterminated by the Ottoman government in 1915 and the following years . An estimated 1 @.@ 5 million Armenians were killed , while the survivors found refuge in other countries . These events , which are known as the Armenian Genocide , are officially denied by the Turkish state , which claims the killings were a result of a " civil war . " The Ottoman government successfully ended the over two thousand year Armenian presence in Western Armenia . 
 By 1916 , most of Western Armenia was occupied by the Russian Empire as part of the Caucasian Campaign of World War I. In parts of the occupied areas , especially around Van , an Armenian autonomy was briefly set up . The Russian army left the region due to the Revolution of 1917 . The Ottoman Empire quickly regained the territories from the small number of irregular Armenian units . In the Caucasus , the Special Transcaucasian Committee was set up after the February Revolution . 
 The Bolsheviks took power in Russia through the October Revolution and soon signed the Armistice of Erzincan to stop the combat in Turkish Armenia . Russian forces abandoned their positions and left the area under weak Armenian control . The Bolsheviks set up the Transcaucasian Commissariat in the Caucasus . The Treaty of Brest @-@ Litovsk was signed on 3 March 1918 and the Ottoman army started to regain the lost territories , taking over Kars by 25 April . Russia signed the Treaty of Brest @-@ Litovsk with the Ottoman Empire and by April 1918 the Transcaucasian Federation proclaimed its independence from Russia . This fragile federation of Armenia , Georgia and Azerbaijan collapsed when the Turks invaded the Caucasus region . The Armenian units defeated the Turks at the Battle of Sardarabad , just 40 kilometers away from Armenia 's future capital Yerevan , preventing the complete destruction of the Armenian nation . 
 A 1918 book by American scholars Lothrop Stoddard and Glenn Frank , titled Stakes of the War listed 8 solutions to the Armenian Question as proposed by different parties . The second proposal , titled " United Armenia " , is described as follows : 
 A union of territories of Turkish , Russian , and Persian Armenia would result in enough area to constitute an independent state , but in no considerable section of this area would the Armenians form a clear majority of the population . To be sure , the Armenians would be the most intelligent and progressive element ; but their numbers and their vitality has been greatly reduced by the long series of persecutions and massacres , and there has been such extensive destruction of property in these territories , that their potential force has been reduced as to form a serious bar to their gaining the ascendancy over the more numerous racial elements in the territory .

 The Armenian National Council declared the independence of the Armenian provinces on 28 May 1918 . It was recognized by the Ottoman Empire by the Treaty of Batum on 4 June 1918 . After its defeat in World War I , the Ottoman Empire and the Allies signed the Armistice of Mudros by which the Turkish troops left the Caucasus and by 1919 the Republic of Armenia established control over the former Kars Oblast , the city of Iğdır and its surrounding territory , including Mount Ararat . 
 On 28 May 1919 , on the first anniversary of the Republic of Armenia , the government of the newly founded country symbolically declared the union of Eastern and Western Armenia , the latter of which was still under the full control of the Turks . Alexander <unk> , the Armenian Prime Minister , read the declaration :

 Almost two years after the Republic of Armenia was established , on 23 April 1920 , the United States officially recognized it . Its frontiers were to be determined later . On 26 April 1920 , the Supreme Council of the Principal Allied and Associated Powers in Paris ( British Prime Minister Lloyd George , French Prime Minister Georges Clemenceau and Italian Prime Minister Francesco Saverio Nitti ) requested that the United States accept the mandate over Armenia and to make an Arbitral Decision to determine the boundaries of Armenia with Turkey . President Woodrow Wilson agreed to act as arbitrator and draw a mutually acceptable border between the two nations . In July 1920 , the US State Department founded the Committee upon the Arbitration of the Boundary between Turkey and Armenia , headed by William Westermann . The Treaty of Sèvres was signed on 10 August 1920 . On 28 September 1920 , the Committee submitted a report that defined the border between Armenia and Turkey . It guaranteed access to the Mediterranean sea for Armenia via Trebizond and proclaimed Turkey 's border regions demilitarization frontier line . 
 A territory of 40 @,@ 000 square miles or 103 @,@ 599 square kilometers , formerly part of the Ottoman Empire , was given to Armenia . Based on the calculations the committee made , the ethnic structure of the 3 @,@ 570 @,@ 000 population would have been : 49 % Muslims ( Turks , Kurds , Tartar Azerbaijanis , and others ) , 40 % Armenians , 5 % <unk> , 4 % Greeks , and 1 % others . It was expected that in the case Armenian refugees ' return , they would make up to 50 % of the population . Two months after the committee submitted the report to the State Department , President Woodrow Wilson received it on 12 November 1920 . Ten days later , Wilson signed the report entitled " Decision of the President of the United States of America respecting the Frontier between Turkey and Armenia , Access for Armenia to the Sea , and the <unk> of Turkish Territory adjacent to the Armenian Frontier . " The report was sent to the US ambassador in Paris Hugh Campbell Wallace on 24 November 1920 . On 6 December 1920 , Wallace delivered the documents to the secretary @-@ general of the peace conference for submission to the Allied Supreme Council .

 In late September 1920 , a war erupted between Armenia and the Mustafa Kemal @-@ led Turkish nationalists ( Government of the Grand National Assembly ) led by <unk> <unk> took place . Turks captured Kars on 30 October 1920 . With the Turkish army in Alexandropol , the Bolsheviks invaded the country from the north east , and on 29 November 1920 , they proclaimed Armenia a Soviet state . On 2 December 1920 , Armenia became a Soviet state according to a joint proclamation of Armenia 's Defence Minister Dro and Soviet representative Boris <unk> in Yerevan . Armenia was forced to sign the Treaty of Alexandropol with the Government of the Grand National Assembly on the night of 2 – 3 December 1920 . The Treaty of Sèvres and Wilson 's award remained " dead letters . " 
 Just after the Soviet invasion of Armenia in November 1920 , the Soviet Azerbaijani leader Nariman <unk> declared that " the old borders between Armenia and Azerbaijan are declared null and void . Mountainous Karabagh , Zangezur , and Nakhichevan are recognized as integral parts of the Socialist Republic of Armenia . " Despite these assurances , both Nakhichevan and Karabakh were kept under Azerbaijani control for another eight months . On 16 March 1921 , Soviet Russia and the Government of the Grand National Assembly signed the Treaty of Moscow . By this treaty , Kars and Ardahan were ceded to Turkey , and Nakhichevan was put under " protectorate " of Azerbaijan . The Treaty of Kars was signed between the Grand National Assembly Government on one side and Armenian SSR , Georgian SSR and Azerbaijan SSR on the other , reaffirming the Treaty of Moscow . 
 = = = Post @-@ World War II : 1945 – 53 = = = 
 After the end of World War II in Europe , the Soviet Union made territorial claims to Turkey . Joseph Stalin pushed Turkey to cede Kars and Ardahan , thus returning the pre @-@ World War I boundary between the Russian and Ottoman empires . Besides these provinces , the Soviet Union also claimed the Straits ( see Turkish Straits crisis ) . " Stalin , perhaps , expected that the Turks , shocked by the Red Army 's triumph , would give up , and Washington and London accept it as a fait accompli , " writes Jamil <unk> . Athena <unk> added , " While Stalin 's motives can be debated , for Armenians at home and abroad the re @-@ emergence of the Armenian Question revived hopes for territorial unification " . On 7 June 1945 Soviet Foreign Minister Vyacheslav Molotov informed the Turkish ambassador in Moscow that the USSR demanded a revision of its border with Turkey . 
 To repopulate the claimed areas with Armenians , the Soviet government organized a repatriation of Armenians living abroad , mostly survivors of the Armenian Genocide . Between 1946 and 1948 , 90 @,@ 000 to 100 @,@ 000 Armenians from Lebanon , Syria , Greece , Iran , Romania , France , and elsewhere moved to Soviet Armenia . 
 An Office of Strategic Services ( predecessor of the CIA ) document dated 31 July 1944 reported that the Armenian Revolutionary Federation changed its extreme anti @-@ Soviet sentiment due to the rise of the Soviet power at the end of the war . In a memorandum sent to the Moscow Conference , Head of the Armenian Church Gevorg VI expressed hope that " justice will finally be rendered " to the Armenians by the " liberation of Turkish Armenia and its annexation to Soviet Armenia . " Armenia 's Communist leader Grigor <unk> defended the claims , describing Kars and Ardahan " of vital importance for the Armenian people as a whole . " The Soviet Armenian élite suggested that the Armenians have earned the right to Kars and Ardahan by their contribution in the Soviet struggle against fascism . Armenian diaspora organizations also supported the idea . 
 As the relations between the West and the Soviet Union deteriorated with the US and the UK backing Turkey , Soviet claims were out of the agenda by 1947 . However , it was not until 1953 , after Stalin 's death , that they officially abandoned their claims , thus ending the dispute . 
 = = = Late Cold War : 1965 – 87 = = = 
 A wave of Armenian nationalism started in the mid @-@ 1960s in the Soviet Union after Nikita Khrushchev came to power and granted relative freedom to the Soviet people during the De @-@ Stalinization era . On 24 April 1965 , the 50th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide , a mass demonstration took place in Yerevan . Thousands of Armenians poured into the streets of Yerevan to commemorate the victims of the genocide ; however , their goal was not to " challenge the authority of the Soviet government " , but " draw the government 's attention " to the genocide and persuade the " Soviet government to assist them in reclaiming their lost lands . " The Kremlin , taking into account the demands of the demonstrators , commissioned a memorial for the genocide . The memorial , which was built on <unk> hill , was completed in 1967 . 
 The 1960s and 1970s saw a rise in underground political and armed struggle against the Soviet Union and the Turkish state in and outside of Armenia . In 1966 , an underground nationalist party called the National United Party was founded by <unk> Khachatryan in Yerevan . It secretly operated in Soviet Armenia from 1966 to the late 1980s and , after the imprisonment of its founding members in 1968 , it was led by Paruyr <unk> . It advocated for the creation of United Armenia through self @-@ determination . Most of its members were arrested and the party was banned . Though the NUP was blamed for the 1977 Moscow bombings , historian Jay Bergman states , " Who actually caused the explosion has never been determined conclusively . " 
 According to Gerard Libaridian , " by the 1970s , the recognition of the [ Armenian ] genocide became a very important objective of the Armenian cause and diaspora political parties linked the recognition of the genocide and the dream of a greater Armenia because Turkey 's recognition of the genocide would constitute the legal basis for the Armenian claims on Western Armenia . " From the mid @-@ 1970s to the late 1980s , several Armenian militant ( often considered terrorist ) groups operated in the Middle East and Western Europe . Most notably the Armenian Secret Army for the Liberation of Armenia ( ASALA ) carried out armed attacks on Turkish diplomatic missions around the world . Two ARF @-@ affiliated groups — the Justice Commandos of the Armenian Genocide ( <unk> ) and the Armenian Revolutionary Army ( ARA ) — also carried out similar attacks , mainly in Western Europe . David C. Rapoport argues that these organizations were inspired by <unk> <unk> , a 77 @-@ year @-@ old Armenian genocide survivor , who assassinated two Turkish consular officials in California in 1973 as an act of revenge against Turkey . 
 The ASALA was the largest of the three and was mostly composed of Lebanese Armenian young adults , who claimed revenge for the Armenian Genocide , which the Turkish state denies . The concept of United Armenia was one of the ultimate goals of ASALA . On 18 June 1987 , the European Parliament , with the initiative of the Greek MPs , formally recognized the Armenian Genocide . William Dalrymple and Olivier Roy claim that Armenian Genocide became internationalized as a result of the activities of the Armenian militant groups in the Western European countries . 
 = = = Nagorno @-@ Karabakh conflict : 1988 – 94 = = = 
 In February 1988 a popular nationalist movement emerged in Soviet Armenia and the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh Autonomous Oblast ( NKAO ) , a small Armenian @-@ populated enclave under the jurisdiction of Soviet Azerbaijan since 1923 . The movement demanded the unification of the two entities , reviving the idea of a united Armenia . 
 On 20 February 1988 , the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh Supreme Council ( the regional legislature ) issued a request to transfer the region from Soviet Azerbaijan to Soviet Armenia . The Moscow government declined the claims , while hundreds of thousands of people demonstrated in Yerevan in support of the idea . Few days later , on 26 February , an anti @-@ Armenian pogrom broke out in the Azerbaijani seaside industrial city Sumgait , forcing thousands of Armenians to leave Azerbaijan en masse . 
 On 15 June 1988 , the Supreme Council of Soviet Armenia voted to accept Nagorno @-@ Karabakh into Armenia . On 17 June 1988 , the Azerbaijan Supreme Soviet refused to transfer the area to Armenia , saying that it was part of Azerbaijan . The leading members of the Karabakh Committee , a group of intellectuals leading the demonstrations , were arrested in December 1988 , but were freed in May 1989 . On 1 December 1989 , the Soviet Armenian Supreme Council and NKAO Supreme Council declared the unification of the two entities ( <unk> « Հայկական <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> » ) . In January 1990 , another pogrom took place against Armenians , this time in Baku . In the meantime , most Azerbaijanis of Armenia and Armenians of Azerbaijan left their homes and moved to their respective countries . 
 Pro @-@ independence members were elected in the majority to the Armenian parliament in the 1990 election . On 23 August 1990 , the Armenian parliament passed a resolution on sovereignty . The tensions grew even larger after the Soviet and Azeri forces deported thousands of Armenian from Shahumyan during Operation Ring in April and May 1991 . After the unsuccessful August Putsch , more Soviet republics declared independence . On 2 September 1991 , the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh Republic proclaimed independence . On 21 September 1991 , the Armenian independence referendum was held with the overwhelming majority voting for the independence of Armenia from the Soviet Union . On 26 November 1991 , the Azerbaijani parliament abolished the autonomy of Nagorno @-@ Karabakh . On 10 December 1991 , an independence referendum was held in Nagorno @-@ Karabakh , boycotted by the Azeri minority , and gained a vote of 99 % in favor of independence . 
 The conflict escalated into a full @-@ scale war with the captured Shusha by Armenian forces on 9 May 1992 . By 1993 , the Armenian forces took control over not only the originally disputed Nagorno @-@ Karabakh , but also several districts surrounding the region . A ceasefire agreement was eventually signed on 5 May 1994 in Bishkek , Kyrgyzstan . According to Thomas de Waal , three factors contributed to the victory of the Armenian side : " Azerbaijan 's political and military chaos , greater Russian support for the Armenians , and the Armenians ' superior fighting skills . " Since the 1994 ceasefire , the Armenian Nagorno @-@ Karabakh Republic has de facto control of the territories taken over in the war .

 Since its foundation in 1890 , the left @-@ wing nationalist Armenian Revolutionary Federation ( also known as Dashnaktsutyun or Dashnak / <unk> ) has been known as the main advocate for United Armenia . Having affiliated organizations throughout the Armenian communities abroad , the ARF is regarded as one of the most influential Armenian institutions in the world , especially in the diaspora . According to researcher Arus Harutyunyan , the party has " made it abundantly clear that historical justice will be achieved once ethnic Armenian repatriate to united Armenia , which in addition to its existing political boundaries would include " Western Armenia , Nagorno @-@ Karabakh , Nakhichevan and Javakhk . In the 1998 party program , it states that the ARF 's first goal is " The creation of a Free , Independent and United Armenia . United Armenia should include inside its borders the Armenian lands [ given to Armenia ] by the Sevres Treaty , as well as Artsakh , Javakhk and Nakhichevan provinces . " " Free , Independent and United Armenia " is the party 's main slogan , and was adopted as its " supreme objective " in the 10th Party Congress in Paris ( 1924 – 25 ) . Hrant Markarian , ARF Bureau Chairman , stated at the 2004 party congress : 
 We are against any relations between Armenia and Turkey that would mean acceptance of any preconditions by us , that would require us to give up our rights or any part of them . We will keep up pressure on Turkey until we achieve full victory , until international recognition of the fact of genocide , until the creation of a United Armenia . 
 = = = Heritage Party = = = 
 Although the platform of the national liberal Heritage party makes no explicit reference to territorial claims , its leader and some its members have expressed their support for them . Heritage supports the formal recognition of the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh Republic by Armenia and has introduced bills for the recognition of the NKR to the Armenian National Assembly in 2007 , 2010 , and 2012 . Although all three attempts were voted down by the ruling Republican Party . Its leader , Raffi Hovannisian ( post @-@ Soviet Armenia 's first foreign minister ) , has hinted at Western Armenia , Javakhk and Nakhichevan with " vague formulations . " For instance , during a 2013 speech about his future plans Hovannisian stated that " only with [ the existence of a ] government belonging to the people will we have awareness of our national interest — with Artsakh , Javakhk , Western Armenia — and future for our children . " In 2011 , a leading party member , <unk> <unk> , stated in an open letter to presidents of Armenia and NKR that by organizing a repatriation of diaspora Armenians to Armenia and Nagorno @-@ Karabakh , " we will [ create a ] base for the liberation of our entire homeland . " 
 In an April 2015 conference on the Armenian Genocide centenary <unk> stated that Armenia should " restore its territorial integrity " by claiming the " territory of its historic homeland . " When asked about how realistic Armenian claims to its historic lands are , Heritage leader Hovannisian responded : " Today 's romantic will become tomorrow 's realist . " In an opinion piece published in The Jerusalem Post on April 11 , 2015 Hovannisian wrote that Turkey occupies Western Armenia and called for " the creation of an Armenian national hearth in historic Western Armenia . " He added , " negotiations between the republics of Turkey and Armenia triggering the first @-@ ever sovereign reciprocal demarcation of the official frontier , including but not limited to provisions for an Armenian easement to the Black Sea .

 The modern use of United Armenia by the Armenian Revolutionary Federation ( ARF ) encompasses the following areas : 
 = = = Nagorno @-@ Karabakh ( Artsakh ) = = = 
 In the aftermath of the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh War , the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh Republic , supported by the Republic of Armenia , took control over the territory of some 11 @,@ 500 km2 , including several districts outside of the originally claimed borders of the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh Autonomous Oblast of the Azerbaijani SSR , creating a " buffer zone " . Kelbajar and Lachin districts guarantee solid land corridor between Armenia proper and Nagorno @-@ Karabakh . Between 500 @,@ 000 and 600 @,@ 000 Azerbaijanis were displaced from the area . In the meantime , almost all Armenians from Azerbaijan ( between 300 @,@ 000 and 400 @,@ 000 ) and Azerbaijanis from Armenia ( over 150 @,@ 000 ) were forced to move to their respective countries as remaining in their homes became nearly impossible since tensions between the two groups have grown worse since the start of the conflict in 1988 . 
 The Nagorno @-@ Karabakh Republic ( also known as Artsakh among Armenians ) remains internationally unrecognized . Today , the Republic of Armenia and Nagorno @-@ Karabakh Republic are de facto functioning as one entity , although the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh Republic territory is internationally recognized as de jure part of Azerbaijan . Nagorno @-@ Karabakh is more <unk> than the Republic of Armenia , with 99 @.@ 7 % of its population being Armenian . The Azerbaijani minority was forced to leave during the war . The areas outside the original NKAO borders taken over by the Armenian forces during the war are mostly uninhabited or very sparsely inhabited , with the city of Lachin being exception . Between 2000 and 2011 , 25 @,@ 000 to 30 @,@ 000 people settled in NKR . 
 Since the end of the conflict , Armenia and Azerbaijan are negotiating through the OSCE Minsk Group . Presidents and Foreign Affairs Ministers of the two countries have been meeting each other alongside the Russian , French and American co @-@ chairmen trying to find a solution for the " frozen conflict " as described by experts . Armenia and Azerbaijan regularly exchange fires in clashes throughout their border . 
 = = = Javakhk ( Javakheti ) = = = 
 The region of Javakheti ( as known to Georgians ) / Javakhk ( as known to Armenians ) comprises the districts of <unk> and <unk> , both part of <unk> @-@ Javakheti province of Georgia . It is overwhelmingly Armenian @-@ populated ( around 95 % ) . The area is geographically isolated from the rest of Georgia and remains economically and socially isolated from Georgia . According to Svante Cornell , Javakhk enjoys " wide cultural autonomy " and " certain Georgian analysts observe that the region is in practice as much ' Armenia ' as ' Georgia ' . It is distinctively easier to get around using Armenian than Georgian in this region ; indeed , foreign visitors claim that at first they had difficulties determining which country they are in . " Generally , Javakheti Armenians live in " reasonable inter @-@ ethnic harmony " within Georgia , although there is a " fairly strong fear for the future , a sense of insecurity . " Javakheti , along with Lori and <unk> , was disputed by Armenia and Georgia from 1918 to 1920 . A brief armed conflict took place between the two nations in December 1918 , mostly over Lori . 
 United Javakhk Democratic Alliance , a local civil organization , is the main organization advocating for an Armenian autonomy in the region . It was founded in 1988 , during the disintegration of the Soviet Union . It campaigns for a referendum in Javakheti on autonomy . It is believed that the organization has close links with the Armenian Revolutionary Federation . Although the ARF claims Javakhk as part of United Armenia , the ARF World Congresses " have agreed with the demands raised by the Armenians of Javakhk that a Javakhk with a high degree of self @-@ government within a federal Georgia would be able to sustain itself and would become a strong link in Georgian @-@ Armenian relations . " ARF Bureau Chairman Hrant Markarian declared in the 2004 party congress : " We want a strong , stable and autonomous Javakheti that is part of Georgia and enjoys state care . " The leader of the United Javakhk Democratic Alliance , Vahagn <unk> , was arrested in 2008 and freed in 2013 . A 2014 article suggested that the alliance has little influence today . 
 During <unk> <unk> 's presidency ( 1991 ) , Javakheti remained de facto semi @-@ independent and only in November 1991 was the Tbilisi @-@ appointed governor able to take power . The issue of Javakheti was in the 1990s " clearly been perceived as the most dangerous potential ethnic conflict in Georgia " , however , no actual armed conflict ever occurred . Taking into account the importance of the bilateral relations , the governments of Armenia and Georgia have pursued a careful and calming policy to avoid tension . The Armenian government has not made territorial claims to Georgia , nor has called for an autonomy in Javakheti . Armenia – Georgia relations have traditionally been friendly , however , from time to time tensions arise between the two countries . In recent years , the status of Armenian churches in Georgia and the status of the Armenian language in Georgian public schools had been a matter of dispute . Svante Cornell argues that " Armenia seems to have had a calming influence on Javakhk " as it is highly dependent on Georgia for imports . This viewpoint is shared by Georgian analysts . 
 Armenian nationalist activist Alexander <unk> has suggested that there are three long @-@ term solutions to the Javakhk issue : 1 ) the region remains part of a Georgia , where the rights of the Armenian population are protected 2 ) " <unk> " , i.e. de facto unification with the Republic of Armenia 3 ) " <unk> " , i.e. Javakhk loses its Armenian population . 
 = = = Western Armenia ( eastern Turkey ) = = = 
 Western Armenia refers to an undefined area , now in eastern Turkey , that had significant Armenian population prior to the Armenian Genocide of 1915 . As a result of the genocide , officially no Armenians live in the area today . However , at least two groups of Armenian origin reside in the area . <unk> peoples , a <unk> group with Armenian ethnic origin , live in the Black Sea coast , particularity in the Rize province . Another group , Crypto @-@ Armenians or " secret " Armenians , live throughout Turkey , especially the eastern parts of the country . It is impossible to determine how many there are due to this ( the fact they keep their identity hidden ) . estimates range from millions to the low <unk> depending on the criteria used to determine it. since the Armenian Genocide , the area has been mostly inhabited by Kurds and Turks , with smaller numbers of Azerbaijanis ( near the Turkish @-@ Armenian border ) and Georgians and Laz people in the northeastern provinces of Turkey . 
 Generally , the Armenian nationalist groups claim the area east of the boundary drawn by US President Woodrow Wilson for the Treaty of Sèvres in 1920 . The Armenian Revolutionary Federation and groups supporting the concept of United Armenia claim that the Treaty of Sèvres , signed on 10 August 1920 between the Ottoman Empire and the Allies , including Armenia is the only legal document determining the border between Armenia and Turkey . Armenia 's Former Deputy Foreign Minister Ara <unk> claims that " Wilsonian Armenia " , the territory granted to the Republic of Armenia in 1920 by Wilson in the scope of the Treaty of Sèvres , is still de jure part of Armenia today . According to him the Treaty of Kars , which determined the current Turkish @-@ Armenian border , has no legal value because it was signed between two internationally unrecognized subjects : Bolshevik Russia and Kemalist Turkey . <unk> has suggested that the Armenian government can file a suit at the International Court of Justice to dispute the border between Armenia and Turkey . 
 22 November is celebrated by some Armenians as the anniversary of the Arbitral Award . In 2010 and 2011 , posters with maps of the Treaty of Sèvres were hung throughout Yerevan . 
 = = = = Official position of Armenia = = = = 
 Since Armenia 's independence from the Soviet Union in 1991 , the Armenian government has not officially made any territorial claims to Turkey . However , the Armenian government has avoided " an explicit and formal recognition of the existing Turkish @-@ Armenian border . " In 2001 , Armenian president Robert Kocharyan stated that the " genocide recognition will not lead to legal consequences or territorial claims . " 
 In 2010 , Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan addressed the Conference Dedicated to the 90th Anniversary of Woodrow Wilson 's Arbitral Award : 
 On 23 July 2011 , during a meeting of Armenian President Serzh Sargsyan with students in <unk> resort city , a student asked Sargsyan if Armenia " will return Western Armenia " in the future . Sargsyan responded : 
 Sargsyan 's statements " were considered by Turkish officials an encouragement for young students to fulfill the task of their generation and occupy eastern Turkey . " During his visit to Baku a few days later , Turkish Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdoğan denounced Sargsyan 's statements and described them as " provocation " and claimed that Sargsyan this " told young Armenians to be ready for a future war with Turkey . " Erdoğan demanded apology from Sargsyan calling his statements a " blunder " . In response , Armenian Deputy Foreign Minister <unk> Kocharyan stated that Sargsyan 's words were " interpreted out of context . " 
 On 5 July 2013 , during a forum of Armenian lawyers in Yerevan on the 100th Anniversary of the Armenian Genocide organized by the Ministry of Diaspora , Armenia 's Prosecutor General Aghvan Hovsepyan made a " sensational statement " . Hovsepyan particularly stated : 
 According to <unk> news agency " this was seen as the first territorial claim of Armenia to Turkey made on an official level . The prosecutor general is the carrier of the highest legal authority in the country , and his statement is equivalent to an official statement . " In response , the Turkish Ministry of Foreign Affairs released a statement on 12 July 2013 denouncing Hovsepyan 's statements . According to the Turkish side his statements reflect the " prevailing problematic mentality in Armenia as to the territorial integrity of its neighbor Turkey . " The statement said that " one should be well aware that no one can presume to claim land from Turkey . "

 By the 16th century , control of Nakhichevan passed to the Safavid dynasty of Persia . Because of its geographic position , it frequently suffered during the earlier wars between Persia and the Ottoman Empire in the 14th to 18th centuries . In 1604 – 1605 , Shah Abbas I , concerned that the lands of Nakhichevan and the surrounding areas could potentially pass into Ottoman hands , decided to institute a scorched earth policy . He forced some 300 @,@ 000 Armenians , including the Armenian population of Nakhichevan to leave their homes and move to the Persian provinces south of the Aras River . After the last 1826 @-@ 1828 Russo @-@ Persian War , Nakhichevan became part of Russia per the Treaty of Turkmenchay after Persia 's forced ceding . Alexandr Griboyedov , the Russian envoy to Persia , reported that 1 @,@ 228 Armenian families from Persia migrated to Nakhichevan , while prior to their migration there were 2 @,@ 024 Muslim and 404 Armenian families living in the province . 
 According to the 1897 Russian Empire Census , the Nakhichevan uyezd of the Erivan Governorate had a population of 100 @,@ 771 , of which 34 @,@ 672 were Armenian ( 34 @.@ 4 % ) , while Caucasian Tatars ( Azerbaijanis ) numbered 64 @,@ 151 or 63 @.@ 7 % of the total population . The proportion of Armenian was around 40 % prior to World War I. Nakhichevan was disputed between Armenia and Azerbaijan from 1918 to 1920 during the countries ' brief independence . The Armenian population of Nakhichevan largely fled the area during the Ottoman invasion in 1918 . By June 1919 , after the British troops left the area , Armenia succeeded in establishing control over Nakhichevan . Some of the Nakhichevan Armenians returned to their homes in summer 1919 . Again , more violence erupted in 1919 leaving some 10 @,@ 000 Armenians dead and some 45 Armenian villages destroyed . 
 After the Soviet takeover of the Caucasus region in 1920 and 1921 , the Treaty of Moscow , also known as the Treaty of Brotherhood , was signed between the Government of the Grand National Assembly and Soviet Russia on 16 March 1921 . According to this treaty Nakhichevan became " an autonomous territory under the auspices of Azerbaijan , under the condition that Azerbaijan will not relinquish the protectorate to any third party . " The Treaty of Kars was signed between the Grand National Assembly and Armenian SSR , Azerbaijan SSR , Georgian SSR on 13 October 1921 . The treaty reaffirmed that the " Turkish Government and the Soviet Governments of Armenia and Azerbaijan are agreed that the region of Nakhichevan ... constitutes an autonomous territory under the protection of Azerbaijan . " By the mid @-@ 1920s , the number of Armenians in Nakhichevan dwindled significantly and according to the 1926 Soviet census the 11 @,@ 276 Armenians made up only 10 @.@ 7 % of the autonomous republic . During the Soviet period , the Armenians of Nakhichevan felt " pressured to leave . " According to the Soviet census of 1979 , only 3 @,@ 406 Armenians resided in Nakhichevan or 1 @.@ 4 % of the total population . The last few thousand Armenians left Nakhichevan in 1988 amid the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh conflict . 
 In August 1987 , the Armenian National Academy of Sciences started a petition to transfer Nakhichevan and Nagorno @-@ Karabakh under jurisdiction of Armenia . In the nationalist movement to unite Nagorno @-@ Karabakh with Armenia , Armenians " used the example of the slow " de @-@ <unk> " of Nakhichevan in the course of the twentieth century as an example of what they feared would happen to them . " During the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh War , clashes occurred between Armenian and Azeri forces in the Nakhichevan @-@ Armenia border , however , the war did not spill over into Nakhichevan . Turkey , Azerbaijan 's close ally , threatened to intervene if Armenia invaded Nakhichevan . Nakhichevan was in center of attention during the destruction of the Armenian cemetery in Julfa in the 2000s . According to the Research on Armenian Architecture , most of the Armenian churches , monasteries and cemeteries were destroyed by Azerbaijan in the 1990s . 
 The Armenian government has never made any claims to Nakhichevan , although there have been calls by nationalist circles ( including <unk> , Heritage youth wing and prominent Nagorno @-@ Karabakh War veteran <unk> <unk> ) to forcibly annex Nakhichevan in case Azerbaijan attacks Nagorno @-@ Karabakh . <unk> <unk> , the Director of the Nizami Museum of Azerbaijani Literature , in his written question to the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe in 2007 claimed that the " seizure Nakhichevan is one of the main military goals of Armenia . " Writing in the Harvard International Review in 2011 US @-@ based Azerbaijani historian Alec <unk> suggested that " Armenian ideologues have lately started to talk about the return of Nakhichevan . "

 There are no public opinion data concerning the United Armenia concept , however , it is popular among Armenians according to Hürriyet Daily News . Moshe Gammer of the Tel Aviv University and Emil <unk> of the Charles University in Prague both suggest that the concept is popular in the Armenian diaspora . One researcher wrote in the Jacobin magazine in 2016 that " [ f ] ew in Armenia support [ the ] pleas to use Karabakh as a springboard to recreate ' Greater Armenia . ' But the idea that Karabakh must be held no matter the cost is widespread . " 
 Armenian historian Gerard Libaridian wrote in 2007 : 
 While it is true that not all Armenians in the Diaspora share the vision of a united Armenia as a political program , territorial aspirations were sustained , nonetheless , by the deep sense of injustice that Armenians generally felt [ Turkish denial of the genocide and lack of any kind of compensation for the genocide losses ] 
 A 2014 survey in Armenia asked what kind of demands should Armenia make to Turkey . Some 80 % agreed that Armenia should make territorial claims ( 30 % said only territorial claims , while another 50 % said territorial , moral , financial , and proprietary ) . Only 5 @.@ 5 % said no demands should be made . According to a 2012 survey , 36 % of Armenians asked agree or somewhat agree that Turkish recognition of the Armenian Genocide will result in territorial compensation , while 45 % believe it will not . The online publication <unk> wrote : " It appears that our pragmatic population believes that all possible demands should be forwarded to Turkey [ ... ] but a relative majority consider the <unk> realization of territorial claims to Turkey is unrealistic . " 
 According to a 2013 Caucasus Barometer survey , when asked about having Nagorno @-@ Karabakh as a formal part of Armenia , 77 % of respondents " definitely favor " such a status , 13 % would be " accepting under certain circumstances " , and 7 % oppose it . When asked about Nagorno @-@ Karabakh becoming an independent country , 56 % would " definitely favor " such a status , 18 % would be " accepting under certain circumstances " , and 24 % said they would " never accept " it .

 In December 1991 , Turkey became one of the first countries to recognize the independence of Armenia from the Soviet Union . The Armenia – Turkey relations deteriorated during the Nagorno @-@ Karabakh war , during which Turkey aligned itself with Azerbaijan . Turkey shares the Turkic heritage with Azerbaijan and the two countries are generally seen as allies in the region . The expression " one nation , two states " has been often used to describe the relations of these countries . 
 In Turkey , " many believe that Armenia 's territorial claims are the main reason why the Armenian administration and lobbyists are pushing for global recognition " of the Armenian Genocide . The Turkish Ministry of Culture and Tourism credits the idea of " Great Armenia " to Armenian President Levon Ter @-@ Petrosyan . According to Prof. <unk> Bal " Turkey considers Armenian policy ( and the activities of its powerful diaspora groups ) since 1989 to be against its national security interests and territorial integrity . Armenia 's failure to recognize the Kars Agreement , along with the frequent public references to eastern Turkey as ' Western Armenia , ' provides a serious irritant to Turkey . The Turkish Mt . Ararat is pictured in the official Armenian state emblem , which Turkey interprets as a sign that the ' greater Armenia ' vision is still very much alive . " 
 According to Hürriyet Daily News some " foreign policy experts draw attention to the fact that Armenia has territorial claims over Turkey , citing certain phrases in the Armenian Constitution and Declaration of Independence . " The Armenia Declaration of Independence was passed on 23 August 1990 officially declaring " the beginning of the process of establishing of independent statehood positioning the question of the creation of a democratic society . " It was signed by Levon Ter @-@ Petrosyan , the President of the Supreme Council , who became the first President of Armenia in 1991 . Article 11 of the declaration read : 
 " The Republic of Armenia stands in support of the task of achieving international recognition of the 1915 Genocide in Ottoman Turkey and Western Armenia . " 
 Turkish historian and political scientist <unk> <unk> characterized Armenian territorials claims to eastern Turkey as " a racist and irredentist demand with regard to a territory which has never in history had an Armenian majority population . And these demands are buttressed with genocide claims which in fact deny the very existence of Turkey in its current borders . "

 Azerbaijani President Heydar Aliyev in 1998 stated in his " Decree of President of Republic of Azerbaijan about genocide of Azerbaijani people " that the " artificial territorial division in essence created the preconditions for implementing the policy of expelling Azerbaijanis from their lands and annihilating them . The concept of ' greater Armenia ' began to be propagated . " 
 In 2012 , President of Azerbaijan and son of Heydar Aliyev , Ilham Aliyev , who has made several statements toward Armenia and Armenians in past such as " our main enemies are Armenians of the world " , stated that " Over the past two centuries , Armenian bigots , in an effort to materialize their ' Great Armenia ' obsession at the expense of historically Azerbaijani lands , have repeatedly committed crimes against humanity such as terrorism , mass extermination , deportation and ethnic cleansing of our people .

 John Randall Daniel " Bob " Braham , DSO * * , DFC * * , AFC , CD ( 6 April 1920 – 7 February 1974 ) was a Royal Air Force ( RAF ) night fighter pilot and fighter ace during the Second World War . 
 Braham was born in April 1920 . Upon leaving school as a teenager he worked for his local constabulary as a clerk . Bored with civil life , Braham joined the RAF on a five @-@ year short service commission in December 1937 . He began basic training in March 1938 and then advanced training from August to December . Upon the completion of flight training he was posted to No. 29 Squadron RAF based at RAF Debden where he learned to fly the Hawker Hurricane and Bristol Blenheim . In 1939 the squadron began to organise itself as a specialised night fighter unit . 
 By August 1940 , the Battle of Britain was under @-@ way . He gained his first victory on 24 August which remained his only success in the battle . In September 1940 No. 29 Squadron was re @-@ equipped with the Bristol Beaufighter . Braham continued operations during " The Blitz " claiming the destruction of two more enemy aircraft . By the end of 1940 he had been awarded the Distinguished Flying Cross ( DFC ) . 
 Braham continued to operate as an anti @-@ intruder pilot after the Blitz ended in May 1941 . He became an ace in September 1941 having achieved five victories and was awarded a bar to his DFC in November 1941 . In June 1942 he was promoted to squadron leader . By October 1942 Braham had claimed 12 enemy aircraft destroyed and he was awarded the Distinguished Service Order ( DSO ) . Braham also flew missions with RAF Coastal Command during this time and claimed a U @-@ Boat damaged and an E @-@ boat destroyed . He was then promoted to wing commander and given command of No. 141 Squadron RAF . Braham undertook more intruder sorties into German @-@ occupied Europe at this point and received a second bar to his DFC in June 1943 and by September 1943 had gained seven more victories , including three , possibly four , German night fighter aces . Consequently , he was awarded a bar to his DSO . 
 The squadron soon converted to the De Havilland Mosquito and in February 1944 Braham was transferred to the operations staff at No. 2 Group RAF but was permitted to fly one operation per week . He achieved nine victories in the Mosquito and in June 1944 was awarded a second bar to his DSO . Braham 's war came to an end on the 24 June 1944 when he was shot down by a pair of single @-@ engine German Focke @-@ Wulf Fw 190 fighters . Braham was captured and spent the rest of the war as a prisoner . He was liberated in May 1945 . 
 Braham was the most highly decorated airman in RAF Fighter Command . He claimed the destruction of 29 enemy aircraft . In addition , he claimed a further six damaged and four probable victories . One of these probable victories can be confirmed through German records , making an unofficial total of 30 enemy aircraft destroyed — 19 were achieved at night . He was the most successful British pilot on twin @-@ engine aircraft . The 19 victories claimed at night rivalled John " Cats Eyes " Cunningham 's tally and was bettered only by night fighter pilot <unk> Burbridge . 
 After the war he was offered a permanent commission , which he initially accepted . Having resigned his commission in March 1946 he re @-@ enlisted briefly . After struggling to find a career that would support his family , Braham emigrated to Canada with his family and enlisted in the Royal Canadian Air Force ( RCAF ) in 1952 . Having held office at the Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe Braham retired from military life and began working as a civilian for the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development . He continued to work there until his death from an undiagnosed brain tumor in 1974 , aged 53 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 John Braham was born on 6 April 1920 in Holcombe , Somerset . His father , Ernest Goodall Braham , was a Methodist Minister who earned his qualifications at Bristol and Liverpool University . Reverend Braham then became a Doctor of Theology after studying at King 's College London in 1935 . Ernest had served as a pilot in the Royal Flying Corps ( RFC ) in First World War . 
 Braham was educated at preparatory school at Belmont from 1930 , and then moved to the public school in Taunton in Somerset . He attended schools in southern England as the <unk> moved across the country to London . Braham was powerfully built . By the age of 15 he was 6 feet 1 inch ( 1 @.@ 85 metres ) and weighed around 12 to 13 stone ( 76 to 83 kilograms ) and used his natural gifts to become a successful boxer . At 15 years and eight months he passed his School Certificate . His further education at Queen Elizabeth 's Grammar School , Blackburn , Lancashire did not go well . He was frequently absent owing to his father 's ministerial appointments which forced the family to continually relocate and consequently his concentration and grades declined . He left grammar school at the age of 16 after only a few months and did not return . 
 Braham struggled to find work in the era of the Great Depression . He considered moving abroad to join the Colonial Police in the British Overseas Territories and briefly entertained training as a sailor in the Merchant Navy . To gain experience he worked as a clerk in Wigan for the Greater Manchester Police . By 1937 , tiring of life as an administrative clerk , Braham turned to the British armed forces for a more fulfilling career . 
 = = = RAF training = = = 
 Aged 17 , Braham applied for a short service commission in the RAF , a course that lasted for five years . The commission was designed to find young aviation enthusiasts with the right physical and academic qualities to become flying officers . To Braham 's surprise , his application was accepted . His commission was dated 7 March 1937 . His service number was <unk> . The commission enabled Braham to enter at the rank of pilot officer . His training mainly consisted of an introduction to flying by civilian organisations contracted to do so by the RAF . Successful candidates advanced to military training . 
 In December 1937 he began flight training at the No. 7 Elementary Flying School ( EFS ) at <unk> . It was normal for pilots to undertake solo flights after eight to eleven hours dual instruction with their flight instructor . For Braham , progress was slow and he made his first solo flight after 14 hours of dual instruction . On 9 March 1938 Braham flew solo for the first time in a Tiger Moth . In May 1938 Braham began officer instruction at RAF Uxbridge . After the completion of this course he was moved to RAF Shawbury to begin training on military aircraft . Now assigned to the No. 11 EFS he elected to become a fighter pilot and began training on the Hawker Hart . He completed his advanced flight training on 20 August 1938 and began the final phase of training in the Hawker Fury . He completed his training in formation flying , aerobatics and gunnery practice over the next four months , graduating in December 1938 . 
 His first squadron was No. 29 Squadron RAF , based at RAF West Malling , flying the two @-@ seater Hawker Demon . In February 1939 No 29 Squadron re @-@ equipped with the Bristol Blenheim . Braham was disappointed at not being trained on the Hawker Hurricane and his reaction to this news was request a transfer which was refused . The squadron spent three months converting onto the Blenheim . In August 1939 No. 29 did convert to the Hurricane but upon the outbreak of war the squadron was reverted to the Blenheim as part of its reorientation to night fighter rather than daylight fighter operations . Braham soon earned the nickname ' Bob ' , which stayed with him throughout his service career . He had chosen this Christian name as his radio call sign to distinguish himself from the multitude of other Johns in the unit .

 Some RAF squadrons were beginning to equip with airborne radar devices . This was a pioneering technology known as aircraft interception ( or " AI " ) . It is unknown when , if , or how many of No 29 Squadron 's Blenheim aircraft were fitted with them in 1940 as the squadron continued to practice , and struggle with , adapting to night @-@ fighter tactics . A great many pilots relied on basic non @-@ AI tactics which usually meant cooperating with search lights and using the aircrew 's eyesight to seek out intruders . By the time Braham and his squadron were called upon to defend Britain from air attacks in August 1940 , after the collapse of the Netherlands , Belgium and France in May – June 1940 , British night fighter defences were very weak . 
 The difficulties of night fighting was evident in the performance of the night @-@ fighter squadrons . One Fairey Battle was shot down in error by a Blenheim which could not correctly identify the aircraft ; some other Blenheims crashed after being caught in the glare of search lights at low @-@ level and return @-@ fire from German bombers had inflicted at least one loss whilst 29 Squadron succeeded on bring down only one German aircraft . While identification friend or foe ( IFF ) devices had been fitted to some British aircraft they were not always switched on . Braham also experienced technical malfunctions in the Blenheims which prompted him to call into question their reliability . On one occasion the hydraulic pipe fractured in the Blenheim he was flying which caused the landing gear to fail and prompted Braham to force @-@ land . At this time he was joined by his gunner / observer Bill Gregory with whom he was to fly frequently .

 By August 1940 the Battle of Britain was intensifying . Most of the battles thus far were in daylight , leaving night @-@ fighter crews frustrated . Now based at RAF Digby in Lincolnshire and operating from the satellite airfield at Wellingore the unit formed part of No. 12 Group RAF defending British air space north of London . On the night of the 24 August 1940 Braham took off and patrolled the Humberside area . The Blenheim was piloted by Braham , and contained air gunner Sergeant <unk> and aircraftman and trained radar operator N. Jacobson . Braham was directed to an aircraft held in searchlights but he closed too fast and overshot . His gunner succeeded in damaging the aircraft sufficiently and a searchlight crew saw it crash into the sea . It was identified as a Heinkel He 111 . Braham 's only other interaction with the enemy occurred at <unk> , when a Junkers Ju 88 dropped bombs on the airfield destroying 13 Avro Ansons and damaged 20 more . Braham survived the attack uninjured . 
 In September 1940 29 Squadron began to convert to the Bristol Beaufighter , a rugged and heavily armed twin @-@ engine aircraft equipped with airborne interception radar in the shape of AI Mk . IV radar sets , just as the Luftwaffe began its campaign against British industrial cities — known as " The Blitz " . By November 29 Squadron had become an all @-@ Beaufighter unit . Braham was among the first to fly the Beaufighter and did so in September . He would , however , spend nearly the entire month hospitalised after a serious car accident . He flew his first wartime operation in a Beaufighter on 17 November 1940 . Squadron Leader Guy Gibson led the mission . Braham flew nine operations in this month and enhanced his skills by completing a blind @-@ flying course which taught pilots to fly in low @-@ visibility conditions . For his service he was awarded the DFC on the 17 January 1941 . 
 The combination of these developments eventually culminated in success . On 13 March 1941 Braham achieved a surprise attack on a Dornier Do 17 , knocking out one of its engines before the cannons jammed . His radar operator , Sergeant Ross , eventually <unk> three of the guns . Braham 's second burst blew the bomber up at a range of 60 yards and the Beaufighter narrowly avoided colliding with the debris . The engagement lasted 13 minutes . The two aircrew achieved another success on the 9 May . Approaching from slightly below their target , Braham followed his radar operator 's instructions until a visual sighting had been made . Identifying an aircraft through a patch of eclipsed stars he could then position himself to attack . Attacking two He 111s he downed one with two close @-@ range and short bursts of cannon fire . The victory was confirmed . The He 111 had crashed in neighbouring Richmond , London . The dead pilot 's Iron Cross was sent to Braham and a souvenir along with two Luftwaffe lifejackets which he preferred to the bulkier British design . He wore the lifejacket until he was shot down . 
 The Blitz ended as the Luftwaffe moved its forces to support Operation Barbarossa and the invasion of the Soviet Union in June 1941 and air raids slackened . During the second half of 1941 , small numbers of German aircraft made pinpoint attacks across Britain and German night fighters attempted intercept operations over England to disrupt RAF Bomber Commands bombing of Germany . On 23 June Braham claimed a probable against a He 111 which Royal Observer Corps personnel saw crash . But since he had lost contact with ground control ( having wandered out of No. 29s area of operations ) and fearing being lost or pursuing the He 111 too low into Barrage balloons , Braham ended the chase and claimed a probable . Records show only one claim was made that night by an RAF fighter other than Braham , and German records list two bombers failing to return . 
 Bill Gregory became Braham 's regular radar operator on 6 July 1941 . He gained another victory the next day on 7 July 1941 with the destruction of a Ju 88 and became an ace on 12 September shooting down a He 111 for his fifth victory . A Do 17 was claimed on the 19 October followed by another He 111 on 24 October . By 25 November 1941 he had claimed 7 enemy aircraft and was awarded a bar to his DFC . He was then promoted to flight lieutenant . After having little leave in 1941 , Braham was rested to prevent exhaustion . He was posted to No 51 OTU ( Operational Training Unit ) at RAF Cranfield on 28 January 1942 . 
 Before he left for Cranfield Braham was involved in another car accident which removed him from duty . He was injured when the Austin 7 in which he was travelling left the road at speed . He had been on a night out celebrating his success . The five passengers ( three officers and two girls ) were all wounded , but one of the women later died in hospital . Once recovered Bob survived two scares on duty at Cranfield . On 13 March a Beaufighter 's engines cut out forcing him to make an emergency landing , and on the same day , his second flight ended with the aircraft 's engines catching fire . Braham managed to conduct a safe landing . 
 During this time Braham and Gregory frequently visited 29 Squadron at West Malling . By now the Germans were sending small @-@ scale formations to bomb selected targets in Britain in what became known as the Baedeker Blitz . Operating on the night of 6 / 7 June 1942 in a borrowed Beaufighter , they destroyed a Dornier 217 raiding Canterbury and soon after Braham was posted back to No 29 Squadron from 51 OTU on 24 July 1942 as acting squadron leader and flight commander of the unit . After damaging a Ju 88 on the 24 August he destroyed another on the 28th using Mark VII AI . The victory was witnessed by United States Army Air Force personnel on a visit to a radar station near the coast . On the 29 August he attacked and destroyed a Ju 88 flying at 150 ft above the English Channel . <unk> " hugging the waves " the Ju 88 pilot succeeded in making violent evasive manoeuvres . Although the German aircraft was damaged , momentarily the Beaufighter passed over the Ju 88 and was hit by a volley of defensive fire that caused the port engine to catch fire , forcing a crash landing near Beachy Head . Neither he nor his operator on that flight , Harry Jacobs , were injured though a bullet was found to have passed through Braham 's seat , missing him by inches . He was awarded his DSO on 9 October 1942 with his tally standing at 10 enemy aircraft destroyed . 
 After receiving the award Braham was out celebrating at a pub . He attempted to drive home whilst intoxicated and crashed into a traffic island . Although drinking and driving was not a criminal offence , the police charged him with damaging public property and fined him £ 5 , the equivalent of a weeks wages . It was his third car crash . His success did not abate . A Ju 88 and Do 217 were claimed off the English coast on the nights of the 26 and 31 October 1942 .

 Braham had destroyed 12 enemy aircraft with one probable and four damaged and was one of the most successful RAF night fighter pilots . In recognition of his experience he was then given command of No. 141 Squadron RAF at RAF Ford on 23 December 1942 as a 22 @-@ year @-@ old wing commander . With him went his AI operator Gregory , now a flying officer with the DFC and Distinguished Flying Medal . Three weeks later , on 20 January 1943 , Braham claimed a Do 217 . 
 No 141 Squadron 's Beaufighter <unk> 's moved to Cornwall in February 1943 to carry out night patrols over Brittany and France and daylight patrols over the Bay of Biscay and Atlantic Approaches to protect RAF Coastal Command aircraft . On 20 March 1943 he claimed a locomotive destroyed and soon afterwards was promoted to acting wing commander . In April Braham attacked a German E @-@ Boat , firing 500 rounds of 20mm cannon at the target causing a large fire . On other operations Braham damaged three E @-@ Boats while also strafing and damaging a U @-@ Boat . 
 In May 1943 No 141 Squadron moved to RAF Wittering . It had been chosen to be the first purpose @-@ built night fighter squadron to operate over Germany and occupied Europe in the bomber support role . The Beaufighters were equipped with the new Serrate radar detector , which picked up the radar impulses given out by the German night fighter 's ' Lichtenstein radar . A number of Beaufighters were also equipped with Mk IV radar , but not the more effective and recently introduced Mark VII . Serrate operations started in June 1943 and were given greater impetus as the Battle of the Ruhr was intensifying and Bomber Command 's losses to German night fighters increased . Braham had immediate success , destroying a Messerschmitt Bf 110 over the Netherlands on 14 June and another nine days later . A claim was also made for a damaged Ju 88 after Braham 's guns had jammed . In between these two successes , Braham was awarded a second bar to his DFC on 15 June 1943 . Throughout June , 141 Squadron claimed five enemy fighters destroyed and two damaged for the loss of one Beaufighter . Braham noted the continuous operations were tiring Gregory and he arranged for him to be rested as squadron operational planning officer . His replacement was Flight Lieutenant Harry " Jacko " Jacobs . 
 His most successful intruder operation took place on the night of the 17 / 18 August 1943 , when he participated in 100 Group 's support of RAF Bomber Command 's Operation Hydra . Braham had decided that it was best to employ the British night fighters in a freelance role . Instead of operating over known German airfields , he elected to interpose the Beaufighters between the outward bomber stream and German airfields in the Netherlands , Germany and Belgium . He hoped that the echoes made by the Beaufighters on the German Lichtenstein radar would attract enemy aircraft and divert them from the bombers . 
 Braham flew in the first wave . As Braham 's wave reached Leeuwarden in the Netherlands and while four of the five RAF fighters made no contact , Braham attracted two enemy night fighters . The Messerschmitt Bf 110s were from IV . / Nachtjagdgeschwader 1 ( Night Fighter Wing 1 ) . Five had taken off under the command of Heinz @-@ Wolfgang Schnaufer — who finished the war as the most successful night fighter of all time with 121 air victories . Schnaufer led his flight out toward the echo but turned back himself after engine trouble . Using his Serrate radar detector , Braham and his radar operator picked up the emissions made by the German fighters ' Lichtenstein radar . He gained on and shot down Feldwebel Georg Kraft , an Experten with 15 air victories from 4 . / NJG 1 . Kraft was killed . Another Bf 110 had witnessed the action and attempted to engage Braham but was outmanoeuvred and dispatched also . Its pilot , Feldwebel Heinz Vinke was the only member of his crew to survive . Braham considered shooting at one crew member , likely Vinke , who he had seen parachute out of the aircraft , but Bill Gregory persuaded him not to . Braham 's Beaufighter was nearly struck by debris from the last victim . Braham had a habit of opening fire at very close range and the resulting disintegration of the Messerschmitt hurled debris at the closely following Beaufighter . One reason for firing at close @-@ range was Braham 's high state of fatigue . In such a state Braham could barely keep his eyes open . Whenever he peered ahead they <unk> and misted . 
 Braham was not satisfied with his current score @-@ rate and lack of action in September 1943 . Consequently , he flew a number of missions against ground targets . Successful night fighter pilots were ordered not to engage in such activities that exposed them to excessive risk . On one particular mission he decided to hunt enemy rail transport after failing to find enemy aircraft . On the Dieppe to Paris line he intercepted a locomotive which exploded after being hit . He attacked another but struck some trees which damaged the underside of the fuselage . Braham maintained control and flew home . It was not unusual for him to return with strange defections caused by collisions with objects . After one sortie against shipping the armourers were drenched in salt water and seaweed when they opened the panel housing the cannons with the intention of replacing spent ammunition . 
 Braham was awarded the first bar to his DSO on 24 September 1943 . Four nights later , on the 28 / 29 September whilst carrying out an intruder operation between Celle and Hanover Braham encountered what he identified to be a Do 217 which engaged him in a dogfight . He downed the enemy aircraft which hit the ground and exploded . He then gained another contact on an enemy aircraft but could not quite catch it then witnessed a crash or explosion nearby . One source suggests the victim of the crash was German ace Hans @-@ Dieter Frank ( 55 victories ) , flying a Heinkel He 219 , who collided with another German fighter while trying to evade Braham . The very next night he claimed a Bf 110 . His victim was identified as German ace August Geiger of IV / NJG 1 ( 53 victories ) . Geiger parachuted out of his fighter but drowned . Within minutes Braham fired on a Ju 88 which he claimed as damaged . Frank , Vinke and Geiger were the 17th , 18th and 19th most successful night fighter aces of the Second World War ( and aerial warfare ) . 
 Against his wishes Braham was rested from operations and posted from No 141 Squadron on 1 October 1943 to attend a staff officer course at Camberley . Braham resisted the move as much as he could . He complained directly to Air Marshal Roderick Hill , commanding Fighter Command at that time . Hill refused to countenance Braham 's request and denied his plea for one last operation . Within days Braham was posted to No. 9 Group RAF . 
 = = = Daylight intruder = = = 
 For three months Braham remained inactive . In February 1944 he was posted to No. 2 Group RAF as ' wing commander night operations ' attached to the 2nd Light Bomber Group , RAF Second Tactical Air Force . Although a staff officer at HQ , Braham was able , with persistence , to persuade his commanding officer , Air Vice Marshal Basil Embry to allow him to ' free @-@ lance ' intruder operations using a De Havilland Mosquito loaned from one of the various squadrons in the group on the proviso he asked his permission beforehand . Braham also had his former radar operators transferred to the group 's headquarters so he could fly with them . He frequently borrowed aircraft from No. 613 Squadron RAF . 
 On 28 February 1944 he took off and claimed a German lorry destroyed south of Paris in a daylight sortie . The Mosquitoes did not carry radar but were fitted with Gee navigational aids . It allowed for accurate navigation but night sorties would not be fruitful since the location of enemy aircraft would be exceptionally difficult . For Braham , hunting in daylight was a strange experience . On 5 March 1944 he flew with Bill Gregory on a 900 @-@ mile trip around northern France . The weather impeded his attempts to shoot up airfields at Orleans and Bourges , so he proceeded to the aerodrome at <unk> . He spotted a Heinkel He 177 flying in the landing circuit at 800 feet . He closed rapidly and dispatched it for his 20th air victory . Braham was denied the chance to operate as a night fighter pilot at this time when there was intense activity . In January 1944 the Luftwaffe initiated Operation Steinbock , a series of strikes against British cities in response to the British offensive over Germany . The German air arm met with severe losses during the operation . 
 On 12 March Braham and Gregory were returning from a 1000 @-@ mile trip and were hit by ground fire over Bayeux . They nursed the Mosquito back to England on one engine — the other having burned out . Just two days later he attended Buckingham Palace where he was awarded a second bar to his DFC from George VI . Both Braham 's wife Joan and his father attended . 
 Ten days later he received permission for another daylight sortie . Squadron Leader Robertson joined him on this occasion as his flight engineer . He flew to Lasham to pick up a Mosquito . His target on this occasion would be Denmark . The Luftwaffe kept a number of operational units in the region so he flew to Coltishall in Norfolk to be nearer his destination and conserve fuel during the sortie . Near Aalborg he sighted two aircraft . So far away from the battle zones , the Germans did not expect to be attacked by the enemy . Neither made much attempt to defend themselves . The first , a Junkers W 34 transport , was shot down and the second , a Junkers Ju 52 , tried a crash @-@ landing only to nose @-@ over and crumple the wings . Braham strafed it to ensure destruction . His gun cameras filmed the action during which he fired 320 rounds . On 4 April he returned to France . Lacking radar , Braham sought out large airfields to be sure of intercepting an enemy aircraft . He flew to Bordeaux looking for He 177s that intelligence suggested were operating against Atlantic convoys from Bordeaux – Mérignac . Braham only encountered a Bücker Bü 131 which fell victim after a brief burst of fire . 
 Nine days later Braham returned to Denmark . On this occasion a No. 305 Squadron RAF Mosquito was borrowed from the Polish . On the mission he encountered a He 111 near <unk> . It was circling a lighthouse at 300 feet . Braham fired a three @-@ second fusillade of fire . The He 111 caught fire and nose @-@ dived into the sea , exploding on impact . A Focke @-@ Wulf Fw 58 trainer followed as his second victory on this mission . Meanwhile , the Germans had tracked the Mosquito by radar . Two Messerschmitt Bf 109s appeared on the scene soon afterwards . The cloud base was only at 1 @,@ 000 feet and he effected his escape by hiding in its folds . One of the Bf 109s fired some ineffectual bursts of fire at Braham and he also encountered some light ground fire . He few directly to Group HQ at Benson . He returned the Mosquito the following day . Some days later , Braham returned to 305 to pick up a Mosquito and joined No. 107 Squadron RAF in a raid against Paris even though he had no formal bomber pilot training . Nine days later near Poitiers , Braham was engaged in a ground attack mission . He spotted a Focke @-@ Wulf Fw 190 carrying a drop tank and under @-@ wing rockets at low @-@ level . He fired at 600 yards as the enemy accelerated to escape . His fire slowed the Fw 190 ; catching up with it , the Fw 190 was hit again and crashed : its wreckage strewn over three fields . The Focke @-@ Wulf was his 27th victory . 
 There was evidence that Braham 's judgement was becoming impaired . He had not taken much leave since the war began in 1939 and he admitted to becoming short @-@ tempered with his family and those around him . He had spent much of the previous two years leading from the front and flying long and hazardous operations over enemy territory . On 7 May 1944 he collected navigator Flight Lieutenant Donald Walsh from Group headquarters . He borrowed a Mosquito from 21 Squadron at Gravesend . He flew to Norfolk to refuel and spent time with his old unit , 141 Squadron , and spent the night at West Raynham . Over Roskilde , Denmark , he caught a Ju 88 after a 10 @-@ minute chase and shot it down — his 28th victory . On 12 May Braham repeated the operation . This time he took Bill Gregory with him . Operating over the Aalborg – Copenhagen line he spotted a Fw 190 near <unk> . Giving chase Braham found himself under attack by a Bf 109 — his presence clearly detected by German radar . His Mosquito was hit in the port wing and the fuel line were ruptured . The Bf 109 then disappeared . Ignoring the damage he closed on the Fw 190 . At zero feet his Mosquito bounced off a mound but he managed to hit the enemy aircraft which burst into flames , stalled and crashed near Aalborg . The range was so close — around 100 yards — the Focke @-@ Wulf nearly collided with Braham . The loss of fuel from the chase and damage coupled with his damaged propellers upon his collision with the ground , meant that the chances of reaching England were slim . He climbed to high altitude 70 miles from the coast and broadcast an emergency message which was received . He ditched the Mosquito which broke in half . They took the dingy and watched the tail and wings remain afloat . He was retrieved with Gregory by air @-@ sea rescue . Royal Navy trawlers sank the sections of aircraft remaining afloat . Regardless of the venture , on 13 June 1944 he received his final award — a second bar to his DSO . 
 Braham was summoned to see Basil Embry . The commanding officer made Braham wait until he had cleaned himself up and was properly dressed . Embry gave Braham a stern rebuke for risking himself in such a fashion . He had not given his agreement to the operation and Braham had taken off before he could give a definitive answer . Nevertheless , his 29th victory eased the tension and Embry invited him to the bar for a conciliatory beer . Bill Gregory did not fly with Bob Braham again . His DFC and bar with DFM reflected his contribution to Braham 's success . He may also have taken the events of 12 May 1944 as a warning . For Braham , the thrill of ranger operations was addictive . On 25 May 1944 he attempted another but turned back because of poor weather . His last operations were flown with both Embry and Walsh on 6 June 1944 during the Normandy landings . The Western Front , dormant since 1940 , was now re @-@ activated . Braham flew over Normandy several times with Mosquito bomber groups in June 1944 . These counted as his last successful operations . 
 = = = Prisoner of war = = = 
 Unlike Gregory , Braham was unperturbed by the events of 12 May 1944 . Braham believed that while the war continued a trained combat pilot must engage the enemy at all costs . His experience allowed him a greater chance to survive the odds than a new pilot but he acknowledged his fortune could not last forever . Braham continued to fly operations deep into enemy airspace over Denmark , alone , and in daylight . 
 On 25 June 1944 he collected a Mosquito from 21 Squadron and the Australian navigator Don Walsh and then flew to Norfolk to refuel at West Raynham . They took off and headed to the Danish coast . Out @-@ to @-@ sea he spotted , and was likely seen , by German coastal ships . As they neared land Braham and Walsh noticed a slight whine in the aircraft 's radio speakers meaning the Mosquito was being tracked by radar . To make it difficult for the enemy to track him he changed course frequently . Ranger operations depended on surprise , but it had clearly been lost . The clouds were thinning out and visibility was improving . Braham decided it was now a folly to continue and decided to head for home . While flying over Funen island he spotted a building with a big Swastika flag draped from a pole . A car was parked outside the entrance . Believing it might contain someone of importance , he dived to attack , strafing the building and destroyed the car . 
 After departing the area he reached the west coast , but Braham had loitered for too long . He spotted two Fw 190s approaching fast from the east . Braham had shot down two of these machines in a Mosquito but he was uncertain of how experienced these pilots had been . There was no cloud cover and the Mosquito could not outrun the faster and more agile single @-@ engine fighters for long . He decided to turn and fight while he still could . In a head @-@ on attack the first Fw 190 pilot missed but the second struck the port wing and engine with cannon fire causing a large fire . The instrument panel and cockpit window was shot through missing both Walsh and Braham by inches . Braham dived to the sea levelling out below 100 feet . He tried to use the fire extinguisher to stop the fire . The German pilot shared Braham 's philosophy of ensuring a kill by shooting at an enemy aircraft until it came down . The Mosquito was hit again and Braham crash @-@ landed his aircraft onto a beach at 150 miles per hour . 
 Braham and Walsh scrambled free of the Mosquito and hid behind a sand dune . As they did so the aircraft 's fuel tanks exploded . The Fw 190 pilot flew over at 20 feet and for a moment they believed he was going to fire upon them . To their relief he waved and flew by . They contemplated escape but instantly German soldiers were running towards them . They had crash @-@ landed near to a radar station and the enemy soldiers were at the crash site very quickly . The Germans fired a few shots in their direction but none hit them . They were captured and searched . The Germans found a Mauser pistol which Braham had taken from a crashed German bomber . It was not well received by his captors . Braham believed they might attack him and he had thought about grabbing the gun , fighting it out with the German guards , finding a friendly Dane and making it to Sweden somehow . The tension eased when he was taken to a barracks and offered some synthetic German coffee . Soon a pair of Luftwaffe officers arrived and escorted him to a cell on an airfield near <unk> . 
 Braham and Walsh were taken across the border by train to Germany and sent to the Luftwaffe interrogation centre at <unk> , near Frankfurt . Along the journey the train stopped because of air raids throughout the day and night . The German guards made it clear they had disdain for the British airmen . When civilians saw them in the carriages and the stations insults and death threats were shouted at them . Joseph Goebbels , the Reich Propaganda Minister , had painted all British and Allied airmen as " terror flyers " and his message resonated with civilians . At one point , a group of drunk German soldiers threatened them with bayonets and tried forcing their way into the carriage of the over @-@ crowded train . Braham feared for his life but the situation was restored when a young SS officer shouted an order and put a stop to it . 
 At the interrogation centre he was poorly fed and physically weakened . It was part of the German technique for weakening resistance to interrogation . The Germans had prepared a file on all famous RAF personnel based on information from British newspapers . They knew most of what had happened in his career and private life . While there , he was interrogated by the aide of <unk> Hermann Göring . The German questioned him about British defences and Supermarine Spitfires , as he was about to resume operations on Ju 88s . <unk> , Braham advised him to steer clear of Spitfires . While at <unk> the pilot who had shot him down — Leutnant Robert Spreckels of Jagdgeschwader 1 ( JG 1 Fighter Wing 1 ) — arrived to meet him . Braham was one of his 12 air victories ; a figure of 45 is often misquoted . An interpreter was provided . Braham promised to buy him a whisky when the Allies won the war . The statement came as a shock to Spreckels who believed firmly in a German victory . Braham came to respect Spreckels , their differences aside . He learned that Spreckels had lost his parents in a British air attack and was surprised when the German dismissed the fact with the words " it is the war . " Both fighter pilots dissociated themselves with the bomber war . They shook hands and parted . 
 The airmen were sent to Stalag Luft III , a Luftwaffe prisoner of war camp near Sagan in Germany near the Polish border . They remained there until 27 January 1945 when the advance of the Red Army forced them to march across Germany . They were fed by the Red Cross parcels and the civilian population who were also fleeing the Soviets . Near the village of <unk> , a Panzer Division , recently out of action , shared their rations with them . They reached Spremberg on 2 February 1945 where they received food and hot water from the depot of the 8th Panzer Division . They reached Bremen on 5 February 1945 . The success of the British Army in north @-@ western Europe necessitated their evacuation to Lübeck on 10 April . They were liberated by elements of the British Army on 2 May 1945 .

 Braham 's return to Britain was not a welcome one . His family found him exceptionally difficult to live with . His short temper and aggressiveness manifested themselves when journalists came to the family 's home in Leicestershire searching for a war @-@ story to print . Braham , who despised publicity , physically ejected them from his property . His decision to shut the media out of his life likely explains why , even as one of the most successful aces , he was virtually unknown in Britain outside the RAF . Braham had also become despondent about the political climate in a country that reduced Winston Churchill to Leader of the Opposition , where the black market was rife and rationing was set to become an indefinite feature of post @-@ war Britain into the 1950s . 
 Braham stayed in the RAF and joined the Night Fighter Development Wing of the Central Fighter Establishment where he tested and developed existing and new night fighting equipment . However , the massive disarmament and reduction of the RAF — mimicking that of the early 1920s — disillusioned Braham even more . Flying was reduced to save costs and removed the one activity that had drawn him into the RAF in 1937 . Initially he still managed regular flights to Belgium , where the RAF retained large bases . While there he was awarded the Order of the Crown and Croix de guerre with Palm for his wartime work . The arrangement was short @-@ lived . The Central Fighter Establishment was cut by half . Coupled with rationing and a declining standard of living and low @-@ wages , Braham resigned from the RAF in March 1946 and applied to join the Rhodesian Colonial Police . Bill Gregory heard of Braham 's decision and contacted Basil Embry , Braham 's former commanding officer . Embry soon persuaded him to return to the RAF at the rank of flight lieutenant with the pay of an acting wing commander . There followed a period of two years of non @-@ flying appointments in the Air Ministry in London . 
 In May 1952 he resigned from the RAF for the second time . Braham decided he could not afford to pay for his three sons ' private education on a wing commander 's salary in Britain . He joined the Royal Canadian Air Force ( RFC ) with the rank of wing commander and on much better pay . On 6 June 1952 the <unk> sailed to Canada . Braham was immediately appointed staff officer for operations and training at Air Defence near Montreal . He taught aircrew how to fly , carry out interceptions and fight in all types of weather . He flew the fast Avro Canada CF @-@ 100 Canuck on 39 occasions and North American F @-@ 86 Sabre as well as the Lockheed T @-@ 33 . Altogether he flew 193 times with the RCAF . His next appointment was 200 miles north of Toronto at the All @-@ Weather Fighter Operational Training Unit . 
 Between October 1957 and July 1960 Braham commanded No. 432 Squadron flying the Avro Canada CF @-@ 100 . While there he was involved in a mid @-@ air collision , losing a wing and unable to jettison the canopy . He ejected through the canopy , parachuting to safety but sustaining back and head injuries . In the summer 1960 , the family moved to Paris when he was appointed senior officer at Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers in Europe ( SHAPE ) . Braham flew when he could . He would patrol the skies over Belgium , West Germany and Luxembourg in variants of the Lockheed F @-@ 104 Starfighter and English Electric Lightning . His tenure at SHAPE ended in 1964 . 
 In 1961 he accepted an invitation from Robert Spreckels , his victor in the 25 June 1944 air battle , to Germany . Spreckels had attempted to locate Braham for some years . While in England on business for a Hamburg shipping firm , he learned Braham had survived the war and was still alive . He persuaded the German consul in Bath to forward a letter to him . Correspondence followed from 1956 but it was only in 1961 that the circumstances permitted a meeting . Spreckels had learned English sufficiently to allow for two to communicate . Braham wrote in Scramble , " Robert Spreckels became , in spite of world tension and hatreds , one who is counted among my company of friends . " 
 For the remainder of his career Braham flew around the World . But , in 1968 , Canadian policy pointed to the amalgamation of all the Canadian armed forces into one unified service . Worse still , the cancellation of the Avro Canada CF @-@ 105 Arrow put an end to Canada 's plan to build their own fighters which curbed Braham 's ambitions as a test pilot . He resigned from the RCAF in January 1968 and settled in Nova Scotia with his wife and three sons . He had flown 5 @,@ 370 hours in 66 types of aircraft with the RCAF . 
 Only 48 , he was not willing to retire . He had always been interested in history and so he joined the Historic Sites Department of the Department of Indian Affairs and Northern Development . He became an area superintendent and served for five years . In December 1973 he experienced a sudden onset of headaches and complained of nausea . He was submitted to hospital but his health declined rapidly . Bob Braham died from a brain tumour on 7 February 1974 at the age of 53 .

 Braham 's father , Reverend Dr <unk> Braham , was an RAF chaplain . His mother was a housewife but she suddenly contracted pneumonia and died on 13 December 1941 . By coincidence it was the same night that Braham was involved in a car accident in which a young woman died . In 1941 Braham met Joan Hyde on a night out . Within a few months they were married by Braham 's father in Duxford on 15 April 1941 just nine days after his 21st birthday . Beaufighters from 29 Squadron were granted permission for a low @-@ fly past to celebrate . They planned a honeymoon in Somerset but the war interrupted it and Braham was returned to his unit . Reverend Braham died at roughly 60 years old in 1951 . The marriage to Joan produced three sons . The eldest , Michael , entered the Royal Military College of Canada and became a captain in the Royal Canadian Navy , retiring in 1987 and starting a twenty @-@ year career as a civilian in the Department of National Defence . Robert became a colonial police officer in Southern Rhodesia and subsequently a police officer in the Royal Canadian Mounted Police , as did his youngest son , David .

 " Today Was a Fairytale " is a song written and recorded by American singer @-@ songwriter Taylor Swift . Produced by Swift and Nathan Chapman , it was released on January 22 , 2010 by Big Machine Records as a single from the corresponding soundtrack for the 2010 film Valentine 's Day , which she acted in . Swift had previously written the song and offered it to producers for the film 's soundtrack . Musically , " Today Was a Fairytale " is pop @-@ influenced and , lyrically , speaks of a magical date . 
 It received generally positive reception from contemporary critics , some who deemed it the best song on the soundtrack , and enjoyed commercial success by reaching the top ten in three countries . In Canada , " Today Was a Fairytale " became Swift 's first number @-@ one song . The song debuted and peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 . Swift promoted " Today Was a Fairytale " at several venues and included it on a revised set list for the continuation of her Fearless Tour in 2010 .

 Swift solely penned " Today Was a Fairytale " in the summer of 2008 and stored it away for a while . After being cast as Felicia Miller on Valentine 's Day , Swift offered the song to the film producers for the soundtrack as she did not believe it fit on her upcoming album . " When this movie opportunity came about , I reached back into my pocket and thought , ' I think this is perfect for the soundtrack . I hope it 's perfect for the soundtrack ' " , Swift told The Tennessean . " Today Was a Fairytale " was released as a single from the Valentine 's Day soundtrack on January 22 , 2010 , exclusively through the iTunes Store .

 " Today Was a Fairytale " has a length of four minutes and two seconds . It is set in common time and has a ballad tempo of 80 beats per minute . It is written in the key of G major and Swift 's vocals span a little more than one octave , from G3 to C5 . It follows the chord progression G – C – Em – D. Jody Rosen and Jonas Weiner of Slate magazine noted that although Swift typically sings country pop , " with the possible exception of that <unk> acoustic guitar " in the song 's introduction " Today Was a Fairytale " displays no aspects of country music in either its instrumentation or vocals . " Taylor 's vowels have gotten flattened and Yankee @-@ ified , " commented Rosen , though Weiner pointed out that Swift 's pop @-@ heavy music was the primary reason for her success . Melanie Bertoldi of Billboard believed Swift 's vocals displayed a newfound maturity . There are two different versions of the song 's intro : the first one having much more electronic production while the second one is only accompanied by an acoustic guitar . 
 The song 's lyrics describe a magical date . Like many of Swift 's songs , the lyrics invoke princess imagery with lines such as " Today was a fairytale / You were the prince / I used to be a damsel in distress . " Bertoldi said the lyrics were " driven more by sweeping emotion than [ ... ] specific , youth @-@ focused imagery " . Occasionally , Swift does interrupt the fairytale construct with modern day , real world details like the time her date arrives or the color of his shirt .

 " Work " is a song recorded by Australian rapper Iggy Azalea for her debut studio album , The New Classic ( 2014 ) . It was released as Azalea 's debut single as a lead artist , and the album 's lead single on 17 March 2013 . The track was written by Azalea , Trocon Markous Roberts , Natalie Sims , and The Invisible Men who produced it with 1st Down of FKi . Hailed by Azalea as her most personal song , " Work " was developed with motivational and inspirational intentions to portray her life story ; specifically dealing with her struggle as an up @-@ and @-@ coming rapper , and her relocation from Mullumbimby , New South Wales to Miami at age 16 . In sequence with its lyrical story , the snap and trap track begins with a sad @-@ stringed verse segment before significantly increasing in tempo at its drum and synth @-@ heavy refrain . 
 A number of music critics consider the song to be among Azalea 's best output , namely praising her flow and the depth of the lyrical content . Commercially , " Work " became a sleeper hit ; it peaked at number 17 on the UK Singles Chart and number 54 on the US Billboard Hot 100 , but was certified silver and platinum by the British Phonographic Industry ( BPI ) and Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) , respectively .

 During December 2012 and January 2013 , " Work " was developed by Iggy Azalea as one of the first three songs for her debut studio album , The New Classic . The song was written in Wales during a period of heavy rain which inspired her to create a track that was " sad , but in a weird way , like happy or calming or sort of peaceful " . With the track , she wanted to give as much information as she could about herself to detract her listeners from being influenced by criticism and tabloid journalism about her ; she disliked the idea of revisiting her past , but felt that it was necessary for her listeners to relate with . Being her first autobiographical song , Azalea encountered difficulty during its writing because of the personal subject matter which she felt she could not fit into a song on its own . 
 Azalea wrote the song with The Invisible Men , Trocon Markous Roberts and Natalie Sims . Sims stated that she , FKi , and Azalea had initially met back in 2008 , but lost touch when Azalea moved to Los Angeles . The track specifically drew inspiration from a period when Azalea suffered from depression , and dropped out of high school to become a domestic worker with her mother . Azalea saved money for a flight ticket to Miami and left Mullumbimby , New South Wales before she turned 16 — an event referenced in the song 's lyric " No money / No family / 16 in the middle of Miami " which Azalea felt " said it all " . For this reason , she chose to write and record " Work " in isolation in Rockfield , Monmouthshire , with no phone reception , visitors or interruptions . She felt as a location it would help her recall the personal struggles she wanted to write about on the song . Azalea also believed that her best output was produced when in an environment outside her comfort zone . Her vocals were recorded at Rockfield Studios and Monnow Valley Studios . Sims , who abandoned four tour dates in order to fly over to Britain to join Azalea , commented on her own involvement in the song that " Fresh out of a breakup and depressed I spent a month in London in a small 10 × 10 studio <unk> writing and writing and writing … Regardless of whether or not u like the content the song told Iggy ’ s true story of struggle sacrifice and hard work as an artist . " 
 Musically , Azalea found inspiration for the composition in the chord progression featured in Outkast 's " B.O.B " ( 2000 ) . " Work " was produced by The Invisible Men and 1st Down of FKi . Azalea stated that the producers " found a middle ground " on the song , with 1st Down being responsible for its " cool alternative sound " , and The Invisible Men creating its " more commercialised , cleaner [ and ] sleeker sound " . Anthony Kilhoffer completed the mixing process , with the assistance of Kyle Ross , at The Mix Spot in Los Angeles . Following the song 's completion , Azalea felt that it achieved the goal she set for its parent album , and denoted it as the record 's most important and vulnerable moment . She has also cited it as her most personal song and the song she is most proud of . 
 = = Composition = = 
 " Work " is a snap and trap song which incorporates elements of EDM . Nina Long of Respect. describes it as the " polar opposite " of Azalea 's previous material . The track opens with Azalea challenging " Walk a mile in these Louboutins " , upon a sweeping keyboard introduction and <unk> beat . It then leads into a similarly sad , string @-@ laden first verse segment containing plaintive melodies . According to Gregory Adams of Exclaim ! , the song " starts off smooth and ballady , with Azalea running through lines about her background , but soon drops into club @-@ minded claps and screeching synths " . A prominent synth , bass and drum @-@ heavy production drop formula then occurs at the song 's refrain , in which Azalea repeats the hook , " I been work work work work , workin ' on my shit " . The production drop casts Azalea 's rapping against a combination of a Roland TR @-@ 808 @-@ heavy , minimal trap beat and EDM clapping effects . Using divisive Southern American English pronunciation , Azalea employs a defiant and rattling , staccato delivery in double @-@ time . Her rapping pace varies from fast , intricate rhymes to slow , stretched @-@ out singular words . While in the verses , her delivery is <unk> riddled . 
 The lyrics are autobiographical and portray Azalea 's fame @-@ seeking relocation from Mullumbimby to Miami at the age of 16 , and deal with subjects of work ethic and dedication to craft . It specifically accounts for the events of Azalea growing up in Mullumbimby , juggling multiple occupations to save an income to independently start anew in Miami . The lyrics also serve as a celebration of Azalea 's progression from being a struggling rapper as a rags to riches story and an underdog anthem . The line " Who don 't know shit ' bout where I was made / Or how many floors that I had to scrub , " was suggested to be directed at her " haters " . While the couplet , " Two feet in the red dirt , school skirt , sugar cane , back lanes " is eloquent for Azalea 's origin . 
 According to Jessie <unk> of Respect . , the lyrics also imply that Azalea " was swindled and take advantage of in her first record deal " , and that it provides insight into events that have toughened Azalea up . While Cristina <unk> of The Associated Press deduced that the lyrics " First deal changed me , robbed blind , basically raped me / Studied the Carters till a deal was offered , slept cold on the floor recording , " are rapped " not as a complaint but as a badge of honor " . Nick Aveling of Time Out writes that Azalea is depicted as a " hustler " and a " woman with immense ambition " in the song . In a NPR publication , Ann Powers viewed the lyrics to be of " unremitting toil " , as well as detailing a story of Azalea " staying up night after night to master her flow " . John Lucas of The Georgia Straight compared the lyrical content to that of Drake 's " Started from the Bottom " ( 2013 ) . According to Matt Jost of RapReviews.com , " Work " is similar to the works of 2 Live Crew and is a " nod to Miami 's music history " .

 The accompanying music video for " Work " was directed by Jonas & François and filmed in Hollywood and Lancaster , California in February 2013 . A budget of about $ 100 @,@ 000 was used for the production . Initially , Azalea wanted to provide a literal representation of the song , and planned to shoot the clip in Australia , but time constraints prevented her from travelling to the country . Accordingly , a desert location was chosen to emulate Azalea 's hometown , Mullumbimby . Prior to the video 's filming , Azalea felt she grasped the concept of what made a good music video and what viewers wanted to see in the clip for " Work " . In turn , she combined several different ideas into the visual because she feared that a music video budget of the same calibre would not arise in future . 
 One of Azalea 's ideas was to pay homage to the Australian film The Adventures of Priscilla , Queen of the Desert ( 1994 ) , as its theme of discrimination was one she identified with as a rejected and struggling rapper . Two scenes in the music video drew reference from the film : the fire swing segment emulated the film 's bonfire scene , and the convertible segment represented the film 's bus . Washed colour elements were also implemented into the convertible scene which was inspired by the 1998 film Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas . Another idea Azalea incorporated into the clip was the large @-@ scale neon qualities featured in Outkast 's music video for " B.O.B " . Azalea stated that the featured lap dancing originated from Vanessa Ferlito 's " infamous " scene of the same action in the 2007 film Death Proof . She found Ferlito 's lap dance appealing , but was convinced to recreate it for " Work " after she noticed its popularity through remakes of it on YouTube . 
 Controversy arose during the music video 's development when Azalea intended to wear a red , high @-@ waisted leotard encrusted in rhinestone flames , to emulate the showgirl fashion featured in The Adventures of Priscilla , Queen of the Desert . The leotard , however , was deemed " too @-@ <unk> " by one of the workers at the label Azalea was signed to , ultimately leading to the worker being dismissed from the project and the leotard being scrapped altogether . Azalea 's final wardrobe consisted of creations by Christian Louboutin , Jeremy Scott and the 2013 Spring / Summer Collection by Dolce & <unk> . Her stylist , Alejandra Hernandez incorporated several pairs of Louboutins into the music video because of their significance to Azalea when she was a struggling rapper who achieved her first sense of accomplishment after buying her first pair .

 The music video 's storyline depicts Azalea 's biographical journey from life on the streets to Hollywood . According to Natasha Stagg of American magazine V , the plot involves Azalea rising from " trailer park standby to high @-@ class Hollywood @-@ ite in a matter of minutes " . The music video opens with Azalea confidently walking on a deserted highway situated in a desert environment . Azalea 's costume includes dark red lipstick , red @-@ soled vertiginous Louboutins , a powder blue Givenchy bag , a tropical print brassiere and shorts . The scene is intercepted with visuals of burning shoes and wheels . Azalea then walks through a trailer park community where several locals stare at her as she passes by .

In this segment , she wears a grey crop top and red slim @-@ fit pants , with her hair styled in a bun . The next scene involves Azalea performing in a dance @-@ off with her two female friends in front of a Freightliner Truck . Azalea sports a plum @-@ coloured fur coat over a white mesh swimsuit .

The video then enters a new scene where Azalea arrives at a dive bar and switches a jukebox on . At the bar , Azalea 's two friends from the Freightliner Truck scene are seated at a table , and a long @-@ haired man wearing dark sunglasses awaits her on a chair in the centre of building . Azalea , dressed in a palm tree bikini and yellow neon shorts , performs a lap dance for the man . She then steals his car keys and runs off with her friends , who drive the man 's convertible out into the desert . Azalea is seen standing in the car , waving a thin piece of material in the wind . They drive through a day and night period before arriving in Hollywood in the morning . Azalea 's friends then drop her off at a sidewalk , where the video ends with her walking in the city .

Fletcher 's invalid son takes a great fancy to John , and through his influence John is employed in his father 's mill . After five years of faithful work , John has risen to the position of foreman . He and Fletcher 's son , Phineas , had become fast friends . Against the wishes of his father , Phineas persuades John to take him to a theatre . The trip proves too much for the invalid , and John carries him home from the theatre in a fainting condition . Fletcher is furious with John , and drives him from the house . About this time there is a great discontent at the mill , among the workmen . Fletcher decides to close it down . After six weeks of starvation , the workmen and their families come in a crowd to the mill and demand that they be given the grain which is stored there . Rather than accede to their demands , Fletcher hurls the bags of grain into the river . This so infuriates the mob that they try to set fire to the mill and put an end to Fletcher . Unable to control the mob , John helps Fletcher , his son and Ursula , to escape . Finally he wins Fletcher 's consent to compromise with the men .

 The production and an adaptation of Dinah Maria Mulock Craik 's popular novel John Halifax , Gentleman . Originally published in 1856 , it would be reprinted numerous times and established itself as a " classic " over the passing decades . At the time of the film 's production Craik 's works were very familiar to audiences . The writer of the scenario is unknown , but it was most likely Lloyd Lonergan . He was an experienced newspaperman employed by The New York Evening World while writing scripts for the Thanhouser productions . The film director is unknown , but it may have been Barry O 'Neil or Lucius J. Henderson . Sometimes the directional credit is given to Theodore Marston . The apparent origin of this error is from the American Film @-@ Index 1908 – 1915 . Film historian Q. David Bowers consulted one of the co @-@ authors of the book , Gunnar Lundquist , and confirmed that the credit of Marston was in error . Theodore Marston worked with Pathé , Kinemacolor , Vitagraph and other companies , but there is no record of Marston working with Thanhouser . This error has persisted in several works including The Complete Index to Literary Sources in Film . Cameramen employed by the company during this era included Blair Smith , Carl Louis Gregory , and Alfred H. Moses , Jr. though none are specifically credited . The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions . 
 The only known cast credits are for Martin Faust , Frank H. Crane , William Russell and Violet Heming . The other cast credits are unknown , but many 1910 Thanhouser productions are fragmentary . In late 1910 , the Thanhouser company released a list of the important personalities in their films . The list included G.W. Abbe , Justus D. Barnes , Frank H. Crane , Irene Crane , Marie Eline , Violet Heming , Martin J. Faust , Thomas Fortune , George Middleton , Grace Moore , John W. Noble , Anna Rosemond , Mrs. George Walters . Bowers lists this as the first known credit of William Russell , formerly of the Biograph Company . Russell would become one of the most important actors of the company until his final departure in 1913 . It is not the earliest known appearance by Russell , as he is shown in a film still of A Thanksgiving Surprise .

 The single reel drama , approximately 1 @,@ 000 feet long , was released on December 2 , 1910 . The film likely had a wide national release , advertising theaters are known in Pennsylvania , Michigan , Kansas , and Indiana . The film is cited by The Complete Index to Literary Sources in Film as the earliest adaptation of John Halifax , Gentleman . 
 The film was received conflicting reviews by both The Moving Picture World and The New York Dramatic Mirror . The reviewer for the World said , " This well known story is rendered into a motion picture in a way that will please the most exacting . ... The picture proves that a good rendering of even an old story is attractive . The audience apparently delights in the character of John Halifax . He is quite as good on the curtain as he is in the book , and there he has always been a favorite . The different parts are played to perfection . The character of the daughter and the ill son are both faithfully reproduced and seem to live before the audience . " The Mirror reviewer The film is not as well acted as Thanhouser pictures usually are . The strict character of the old Quaker is insufficiently expressed and is apt to leave the audience to guess why John is ordered out , and the strike scene is far from impressive . The mob to a man wave their sticks incessantly , instead of portraying intense rage as should have been done . " Bowers noted that the Mirror was not a neutral party in respect to the works of the Independent producers .

 In January 1980 , the producers and writers began plotting the culminating episodes for season 3 . Executive producer Philip <unk> says they decided to attempt to work in a ploy to hold interest over the summer . CBS ordered two extra episodes , which gave them a chance to weave many storylines into the scripts . He noted that " J.R. had developed into a character we felt everyone out there wanted to see get his comeuppance . And we did need that sort of a cliffhanger to carry us over to the new season . " He said that there was consensus that a mystery with several suspects was optimal and that it should be a sudden event . <unk> denied rumors that the shooting was a ploy to make it easy to write Hagman out of the script if his contract negotiations became too difficult . Producer Leonard Katzman , executive story consultant Art Lewis and story editor Camille <unk> decided the actual culprit in mid @-@ March by process of logical elimination with the belief that the audience should not be surprised by someone who was not important to the show as the shooter .

 = Hurricane Eloise = 
 Hurricane Eloise was the most destructive tropical cyclone of the 1975 Atlantic hurricane season . The fifth tropical storm , fourth hurricane , and second major hurricane of the season , Eloise formed as a tropical depression on September 13 to the east of the Virgin Islands . The depression tracked westward and intensified into a tropical storm while passing to the north of Puerto Rico . Eloise briefly attained hurricane intensity soon thereafter , but weakened back to a tropical storm upon making landfall over Hispaniola . A weak and disorganized cyclone , Eloise emerged into open waters of the northern Caribbean Sea ; upon striking the northern Yucatan Peninsula , it turned north and began to re @-@ intensify . In the Gulf of Mexico , the cyclone quickly matured and became a Category 3 hurricane on September 23 . Eloise made landfall along the Florida Panhandle west of Panama City before moving inland across Alabama and dissipating on September 24 . 
 The storm produced torrential rainfall throughout the islands of Puerto Rico and Hispaniola , causing extensive flooding that led to severe damage and more than 40 deaths . Thousands of people in these areas became homeless as flood waters submerged numerous communities . As Eloise progressed westward , it affected Cuba to a lesser extent . In advance of the storm , about 100 @,@ 000 residents evacuated from the Gulf Coast region . Upon making landfall in Florida , Eloise generated wind gusts of 155 miles per hour ( 249 km / h ) , which demolished hundreds of buildings in the area . The storm 's severe winds , waves , and storm surge left numerous beaches , piers , and other coastal structures heavily impaired . 
 Wind @-@ related damage extended into inland Alabama and Georgia . Further north , torrential rains along the entire East Coast of the United States created an unprecedented and far @-@ reaching flooding event , especially into the Mid @-@ Atlantic States . In that region , an additional 17 people died as a result of freshwater flooding from the post @-@ tropical storm ; infrastructural and geological effects were comparable to those from Hurricane Agnes several years prior . Across the United States , damage amounted to approximately $ 560 million . The storm killed 80 people along its entire track ; due to the severe damage , the name " Eloise " was retired from the Atlantic tropical cyclone naming lists . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of Hurricane Eloise trace back to a tropical wave that emerged from the western coast of Africa on September 6 , 1975 . Satellite imagery indicated that the system was initially disjointed and poorly developed , although there was evidence of a low @-@ level circulation . The disturbance tracked westward for several days as it slowly matured . On September 13 , a ship called the Gulf Hansa recorded winds of around 25 mph ( 40 km / h ) and 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) seas in association with the system . Shortly thereafter , a reconnaissance aircraft found a center of circulation 575 miles ( 925 km ) east of the Virgin Islands , and it is estimated that the storm became a tropical depression at 0600 UTC . 
 The depression continued moving towards the west as it gradually strengthened . On September 16 , the system attained tropical storm status and was designated Eloise ; accordingly , the first advisory on the system was issued by the San Juan Weather Bureau office . While in the vicinity of a strengthening anticyclone aloft , Eloise became better organized , and the storm rapidly intensified and reached Category 1 hurricane status 18 hours after being named . The cyclone soon made landfall on the Dominican Republic , inhibiting further development . Although initially predicted to remain north of land , the storm moved across northern Hispaniola and then tracked across southeastern Cuba . After 36 hours with much of its circulation over mountainous terrain , Eloise deteriorated to a tropical storm on September 17 . 
 The cyclone emerged over the open waters of the northern Caribbean on September 19 , passing Jamaica to the north as it moved away from Cuba . Despite favorable upper @-@ level conditions , its interaction with land — combined with the weakening of a ridge to the north — left the storm 's center distorted . Eloise remained a fairly disorganized tropical storm until September 20 , when it approached the Yucatan Peninsula and began to re @-@ intensify . The storm crossed over the northern tip of the peninsula as it began to turn northward in response to an approaching trough . Between September 17 and September 21 , however , reports on the storm were scarce , leading to uncertainty in its exact location and strength . Upon entering the Gulf of Mexico , Eloise quickly organized . The trough enhanced the wind divergence over the storm 's center , allowing it to strengthen once again to reach hurricane force about 345 miles ( 555 km ) south of New Orleans , Louisiana . 
 On September 22 , the cyclone intensified to attain Category 2 strength , and became a major hurricane of Category 3 status shortly thereafter as it turned towards the northeast . Several ships penetrated the storm 's center during its passage through the gulf . The hurricane also moved over two experimental buoys which recorded data on the storm , aiding meteorologists in their forecasts . Hurricane Eloise continued to strengthen until it reached its peak winds of 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) and a minimum barometric pressure of about 955 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 2 inHg ) . It moved ashore along the Florida Panhandle near Panama City on September 23 . Shortly after making landfall , the hurricane rapidly degenerated . Just six hours later , it had weakened into a tropical storm , while situated over eastern Alabama . It further weakened into a tropical depression at 0000 UTC on September 24 . The depression transitioned into an extratropical storm over Virginia , and became indistinguishable by later that same day . The remnant moisture , however , merged with a weather front to produce widespread and heavy precipitation . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 In advance of Hurricane Eloise , warnings for heavy rainfall and potential flooding were issued for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands . A hurricane warning was declared for parts of the Dominican Republic about 12 hours before landfall . A " hurricane emergency " was put into effect for the Oriente Province of Cuba , while a " state of alert " was issued for the Camagüey Province . Cubana de Aviación suspended all flights to Oriente . 
 On and before September 15 , there was still uncertainty as to whether Eloise would impact the United States . However , officials in Florida began taking precautionary measures . When the storm entered the Gulf of Mexico , forecasters suggested that the storm would continue northward and strike the area near Mobile Bay . Contrary to predictions , by late on September 22 , the storm had turned northeast , and some residents of Florida were still unaware of the storm 's threat despite the issuance of hurricane warnings 24 hours in advance . As a result , evacuations were delayed to an extent . During the morning hours of September 23 , civil preparedness workers drove through coastal towns with loudspeakers advising people to seek shelter . Due of the intensity of the approaching hurricane , evacuations along the coast were ultimately thorough , despite the initial delay . It was reported that 99 % of Pensacola residents along the beach had left their homes , and overall , 100 @,@ 000 people evacuated from areas in Louisiana through Florida . 
 A statement issued by the National Weather Service advised people in nine Florida counties to complete hurricane preparations , which included securing loose objects and moving watercraft to safety . Homes along the coast were boarded up by their owners , while offshore , workers were removed from oil platforms . A spokesman for Royal Dutch Shell reported that 800 workers were to be evacuated . In New Orleans , emergency equipment was readied and inspected . The New Orleans Levee Board went into a second @-@ stage alert on September 21 , and cleared debris from floodwall openings .

 As a weak tropical depression , the storm brought 5 to 10 inches ( 130 to 250 mm ) of rainfall to portions of the Leeward Islands , including St. Kitts and St. Martin . More minor amounts of precipitation fell over the northernmost islands , and winds were light in these areas . 
 Despite being only a tropical storm while passing by Puerto Rico , Eloise produced extreme amounts of rainfall on the island , peaking at 33 @.@ 29 inches ( 846 mm ) in Dos Bocas . Other totals of 10 to 20 inches ( 250 to 510 mm ) were common . The heavy rains resulted in severe flash flooding which killed 34 people , mostly from drownings , and left $ 60 million in damages . Several hundred people were injured , and the storm forced over 6 @,@ 000 residents from their homes . Dozens of towns and villages were flooded , though Utuado , with a population of 35 @,@ 000 at the time , was hit the hardest . The situation in that town was described as a " total disaster " ; four housing developments were under water , and dozens of vehicles were washed away . The flood waters submerged thousands of miles of roads and put several bridges out @-@ of @-@ service . 
 As the storm proceeded westward , it dropped heavy rainfall throughout eastern and southern Hispaniola . Widespread flooding impacted Haiti and the Dominican Republic , leaving a total of 25 people dead . Although the most intense winds remained offshore , a gust of 50 miles per hour ( 80 km / h ) was recorded at Cape Engaño . Puerto Plata on the northern coast of the Dominican Republic was also battered by high winds and heavy rain . Following the storm , electricity was turned off due to the danger of electrocutions . Despite the storm 's effects across Hispaniola and Puerto Rico , no monetary damage totals are available . 
 Rain and wind from the storm affected the southern Bahamas , Cuba , Jamaica , the Cayman Islands , and the northern Yucatan Peninsula . Since the storm was primarily weak while passing by these areas , no significant damage was reported . Eloise brought torrential rainfall and winds of 20 mph ( 32 km / h ) to the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in southeastern Cuba , inflicting $ 65 @,@ 000 in damage . Personnel on the base were moved to designated hurricane shelters in advance of the storm .

 Eloise came ashore along the coast of northern Florida as a Category 3 storm producing winds of 90 mph ( 140 km / h ) with gusts that reached 155 mph ( 249 km / h ) . Sustained winds were likely higher , but due to the sparsity of recording stations , few official records exist . The winds in the area were reportedly the strongest of the century . Hurricane @-@ force winds occurred from Fort Walton Beach through Panama City . Along the coast , tides ran 12 to 16 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 to 4 @.@ 9 m ) above normal , peaking at 18 feet ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) . Hurricane Eloise spawned several tornadoes as it pressed inland . In general , rainfall ranged from 4 to 8 inches ( 100 to 200 mm ) ; at the Eglin Air Force Base near Valparaiso , however , the hurricane dropped 14 @.@ 9 inches ( 380 mm ) of precipitation . The heaviest rainfall was usually confined to northwest of the storm 's track , and a number of locations to the east of Eloise 's center picked up less than 1 inch ( 25 mm ) of rain . 
 Damage from the hurricane was widespread . Fort Walton Beach , where hundreds of structures were damaged or destroyed , was hit particularly hard . In some areas , the storm surge washed away buildings demolished by the strong winds . The winds cleared certain locations of trees and buried properties and roads under sand . Throughout northwest Florida , an estimated 8 @,@ 000 people suffered storm @-@ related losses , and 500 businesses were completely destroyed . An article in the Tallahassee Democrat reported that " Cottages , motels , restaurants , convenience stores and other beach businesses were strewn across the highway in a tangle of down power poles , lines and busted mains . " A 2 @,@ 100 @-@ acre ( 850 ha ) shrimp farm at Panama City , the first of its kind , was effectively lost . The storm destroyed the farm 's prospective initial harvest , 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 pounds ( 680 @,@ 000 kg ) of shrimp enclosed in a system of nets and enclosures . The president of the company described the subsequent events as six months of extreme turmoil in an effort to recover , followed by a quick and steady rebound . By the spring of 1976 , the company became confident in financial success and full recovery . 
 The storm caused severe beach erosion in Bay County ; approximately 801 @,@ 000 cubic yards ( 612 @,@ 000 m3 ) of sand was removed . Storm @-@ related changes in the coastal topography resulted in extensive structural damage in the Panama City Beach area . The most severe damage was concentrated in a 22 miles ( 35 km ) area of the shore east of the hurricane 's eye , and storm surge peaked in intensity for no more than a half hour according to preliminary estimates . Much of the resultant damage came as a result of foundation undermining , which was compared to that of the New England hurricane of 1938 . Although Eloise was not abnormally strong , the <unk> setting and building standards in the area were blamed for the destruction of many homes and businesses . Monetary losses from property damage in Panama City Beach alone totaled about $ 50 million . 
 The first major storm to strike the region in 40 years , Hurricane Eloise did not directly kill anyone in the state of Florida . However , four deaths of an indirect nature were attributed to the hurricane ; two of them were related to heart attacks . Numerous people sustained injuries , largely from broken glass or cleanup efforts . Overall property damage from the storm in Florida amounted to $ 150 million . In the storm 's aftermath , a study of the hurricane 's effect on aquatic animals living in the swash zone ( the immediate area where land and the ocean meet ) of Panama City Beach was conducted . The study concluded that compared to 11 consecutive months of data prior to the storm , the swash zone experienced a brief influx of animal species normally found offshore . However , the number decreased to near normal shortly thereafter . Also along the shore , the hurricane dismantled or severely impaired several piers , including the total destruction of a 300 feet ( 91 m ) extension of the Okaloosa Island Pier built just three years earlier and part of its original span . A fishing pier at St. Andrews State Park also suffered vast damage , along with another wooden pier at Mexico Beach and the M.B. Miller Pier at Panama City Beach , which lost its end section to the storm .

 As the hurricane progressed inland , it passed over eastern Alabama , generating strong winds . A gust of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) was recorded northeast of Ozark . Winds elsewhere in the state ranged from around 35 mph ( 56 km / h ) to 88 mph ( 142 km / h ) . Precipitation in Alabama peaked at 5 @.@ 54 inches ( 141 mm ) . The high winds resulted in severe damage to property and crops , amounting to $ 100 million . Eloise cut power and telephone service in the area , and in Geneva County , several people sustained storm @-@ related injuries . As in Florida , the weakening hurricane spawned a number of tornadoes in Alabama and Georgia . Preliminary reports indicated that every county in southeastern Alabama received some damage from the storm . The strong winds uprooted trees and knocked down powerlines . Heavy rain associated with the storm caused a leak in the Alabama State Capitol building roof . Gusty winds , moderate to heavy rainfall , and low pressures extended into Georgia , Louisiana , and to a lesser extent , Mississippi . 
 The remnants of Eloise interacted with another weather system , producing widespread precipitation across the Eastern United States , including portions of the Ohio Valley , the Mid @-@ Atlantic states , and New England . The deluge was " almost continuous " during the period between September 22 and 26 according to a statement by the National Weather Service . One of the highest rainfall totals in association with the storm occurred in Westminster , Maryland , where 14 @.@ 23 inches ( 361 mm ) of rain were recorded . Elsewhere , 7 to 10 inches ( 180 to 250 mm ) or more of precipitation fell throughout parts of Pennsylvania , New Jersey , New York and Connecticut . At least 22 states received rainfall from Hurricane Eloise and its remnant moisture . Nearby Hurricane Faye may have also contributed to the heavy rainfall , although this connection was never confirmed . In Washington , D.C. , 9 @.@ 08 inches ( 231 mm ) of rain contributed to the wettest September on record since 1934 . The excessive rainfall led to extensive flooding throughout the region , in some areas exceeding 50- to 100 @-@ year levels . 
 Pennsylvania and New York bore the brunt of the flooding , which culminated in loss of life and severe property damage . Along the central Southern Tier region of New York , the storm damaged or destroyed over 700 structures . Flooding throughout the Northeastern United States disabled over a dozen water plants and at least 16 sewage treatment plants , prompting a boil @-@ water advisory in Pennsylvania 's capital city of Harrisburg . Infrastructure further south also suffered ; in Maryland , the Monocacy River — a tributary of the Potomac — swelled to 14 feet ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) above flood stage , inundating the city of Frederick and compromising the city 's supply of fresh drinking water . A final downpour of rain on the night of September 25 – 26 led to an additional 4 inches ( 100 mm ) of rain in central Maryland triggered severe flash flooding . In some cases , this onslaught affected the same areas that were still recovering from Hurricane Agnes several years earlier , including Ellicott City , Elkridge , and Laurel , where two major rivers breached their banks and engulfed nearby areas . Many homes and businesses were lost , along with numerous vehicles ; in the aftermath , looters entered on boats to access the devastated cities . The floodgates at the Rocky Gorge Dam in <unk> were opened , forcing 500 residents downstream to leave their homes . 
 The consequences of the flooding rains were the worst seen in areas of the interior Mid @-@ Atlantic states since Agnes , and comparisons were often drawn between the two hurricanes . In Pennsylvania alone , flooding from the remnants of Eloise forced 20 @,@ 000 residents out of their homes ; thousands further south in the Washington , D.C. area , where severe flooding impacted the city 's southern suburbs , also fled to seek refuge . Further , many motorists throughout the region became stranded on highways inundated by floodwaters . Four Mile Run and nearby streams overflowed and " tumbled through residential neighborhoods " . Hundreds of families in the Alexandria and Arlington , Virginia area suffered flood @-@ related losses . Across the Northeastern U.S. , the storm system killed 17 people and inflicted $ 300 million in damage . An instance of a storm @-@ induced fatality is the death of a man in White Plains , New York , who was killed by waters raging across the Hutchinson River Parkway . <unk> , the extended period of wet weather threatened a range of crops , including the Rhode Island apple crop , of which 35 % was feared to have been destroyed , and corn and sweet potato fields in North Carolina . With ground too moist for farm machinery to operate on , harvests were postponed .

 After touring the disaster area , Florida Governor Reubin Askew noted , " I think we 're going to have to take a long , close look at some of the construction [ ... ] Some of the structures simply won 't be able to be built back in the exact location where they were . " Governor Askew recruited 400 National Guard troops to prevent looting following the storm . He also requested the initial declaration of five counties along the Florida panhandle as national disaster areas , and stated that he would consider adding two more counties . The declaration would make residents in the counties recognized as disaster areas eligible to receive federal aid . Immediately following the storm , the mayor of Panama City criticized the state of Florida for failing to provide sufficient post @-@ storm aid . Despite the destruction , the storm reportedly had some economic benefits ; in the midst of rebuilding and recovery , business grew , especially in and around Panama City , and people began to move into the area . In at least one instance , the hurricane and its associated storm surge had a lasting effect on local geography , breaching Crooked Island in Bay County to create an inlet 0 @.@ 75 miles ( 1 @.@ 21 km ) wide referred to as Eloise Inlet . Eloise provided a comprehensive base of information on beach and dune erosion along the Florida panhandle , which aided in the programming of certain erosion prediction numerical models . In 1995 , reports from the aftermath of Hurricane Opal created a more extensive collection of data . 
 On September 26 , President Gerald Ford approved the declaration for Florida , and later issued a separate declaration for 30 counties in Pennsylvania as the storm 's flooding rains progressed northward . Pennsylvania Lieutenant Governor Ernest Kline assigned 600 National Guardsmen to assist in the evacuation of flood victims and maintain security in storm @-@ ravaged areas . Over $ 430 million in federal disaster relief was spent overall in 1975 and distributed to 92 @,@ 000 families ; the bulk of the funds went to recovery for areas affected by Hurricane Eloise along its entire course . In Maryland , Governor Marvin Mandel placed 10 of the state 's 23 counties under a state of emergency . Following the severe damage caused by Hurricane Eloise , its name was retired at the end of the 1975 season . As such , the name was removed from the rotating lists of names used in the Atlantic hurricane basin . However , Eloise was not replaced by any particular name due to the addition of male names into the lists in 1979 . 
 = Halo : The Fall of Reach = 
 Halo : The Fall of Reach is a military science fiction novel by Eric Nylund , based on the Halo series of video games , and acts as a prequel to Halo : Combat Evolved , the first game in the series . The book was released in October 2001 and is the first Halo novel . It is set in the fictional Halo universe , taking place in the 26th century across several planets and locations . The novel details the events which led up to the game and explains the origins of the SPARTAN II super soldiers , narrating the story of the series protagonist , the Master Chief . 
 The Fall of Reach was conceived after Nylund had discussed the possibility of a Halo novel with Microsoft 's Franchise Development Group . A " Halo Story Bible " was created to assist Nylund in keeping with Halo canon . The novel was written in seven weeks , Nylund 's shortest writing deadline . 
 The book was well received by critics who thought it added depth to the plot of the game but the large number of characters was highlighted as a shortcoming . Going on to sell over one million copies , the success of The Fall of Reach paved the way for further Xbox game novelizations , including another book in the Halo series . William C. Dietz would write the next book , entitled Halo : The Flood . The book was adapted into a comic series entitled Halo : Fall of Reach and released in 2010 . The book itself was re @-@ released on December 7 , 2010 after the comic book adaptation , and contained new content as well as updating both editing mistakes and minor continuity errors . The novel was also adapted into an animated series that was streamed exclusively through the Halo Channel to coincide with the 2015 release of Halo 5 : Guardians .

 Eric Nylund had discussed the possibility of a Halo related novel with Eric Trautmann , a member of Microsoft 's Franchise Development Group , before Halo : Combat Evolved was developed but it was postponed due to legal technicalities . Nylund thought positively of the delay as it " gave [ him ] a chance to see the game in almost every stage of development before [ he ] started writing . " He wrote the book based on an outline approved by Bungie and the " Halo Story Bible " , a book containing all information on the characters and universe in which Halo takes place , so that his story would not conflict with other Halo publications . Nylund found it easier to write with the " Bible " available as the details of the universe he was writing in were already established , only minor alterations were made to fit the novel into the universe . A seven @-@ week deadline was established for Nylund to write the book . According to Trautmann , the book was nearly cancelled because Bungie was opposed to the idea of the Master Chief having a definite backstory . They eventually relented after Trautmann made them the offer that they let the book be completed and published in exchange for he , Matt <unk> , and Brannon Boren completing Combat Evolved 's script , which was still " 80 percent " unfinished .

 The Fall of Reach takes place in the Halo universe and spans several decades , beginning in 2517 describing events up to 2552 . In the Halo universe , traveling faster than the speed of light is possible through slipspace , another dimension where special relativity does not apply . This has allowed humans to colonize hundreds of other planets which are controlled by the United Nations Space Command ( UNSC ) . Feeling repressed by the UNSC 's heavy @-@ handed rule , some colonies revolt ; fearing rebellion will tear the UNSC apart , military leaders approve the SPARTAN Project , a secret squad of super soldiers to quietly suppress rebellion . 
 The protagonist of The Fall of Reach is the Spartan soldier Master Chief . Dr. Catherine Halsey , the creator of the SPARTAN Project , is introduced alongside then @-@ Lieutenant Jacob Keyes . Franklin Mendez is the trainer of the Spartan II and Spartan III programs , teaching them their physical combat skills while an AI named Déjà teaches them military history and strategy . Cortana , Master Chief 's AI companion through much of the series , is also present as Dr. Halsey 's aide in the lead @-@ up to the Spartans ' mission . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 The novel opens with the civilian Dr. Catherine Halsey and Lieutenant Jacob Keyes traveling to meet John , a six @-@ year @-@ old boy . Dr. Halsey reveals to Keyes that John is one of 150 children who possess rare genetic markers making them suitable for conscription into the SPARTAN @-@ II program , a secret experiment with the aim of creating super soldiers for the UNSC to quell rebellions . Seventy @-@ five of the children are kidnapped by operatives of the Office of Naval Intelligence and replaced by clones engineered to die of natural causes shortly thereafter . From this point on , the recruits are known only by their first name and a three digit number . John @-@ 117 and the rest of the children are drilled and trained by Franklin Mendez ; John demonstrates leadership of his fellow Spartans leading to his promotion to squad leader . In 2525 , the Spartans undergo a series of surgical enhancements which turn them into highly efficient super soldiers at the cost of crippling or killing more than half of the original seventy @-@ five . The Spartans are also equipped with powerful MJOLNIR battle armor , designed to respond as quickly as the soldier 's thoughts . John @-@ 117 is given the rank of Master Chief Petty Officer . The Spartans are highly successful , but they experience a priority shift after a collective of alien races known as the Covenant begin obliterating human colonies , declaring humanity 's destruction as the will of the gods . Mendez leaves the group to train the next generation of Spartans as John and his comrades first face the Covenant . 
 By 2552 , the war against the Covenant is going poorly . The technological superiority of the Covenant means that space battles heavily favor the Covenant , and the UNSC can only win engagements by suffering tremendous losses . To prevent the discovery of Earth or other human colonies , Vice Admiral Cole creates the " Cole Protocol " , which forbids direct slipspace jumps to Earth or any other population center and mandates the destruction of a ship before it can be captured by the Covenant . Jacob Keyes , now commander of the destroyer Iroquois , discovers four Covenant ships arriving at the Sigma Octanus System , and single @-@ handedly destroys three of them ; his heroics earn Keyes the rank of Captain . The Covenant proceed to overrun Sigma Octanus IV , searching for a mysterious ancient artifact . Despite a costly fight , the humans manage to repel the Covenant , and Keyes intercepts a coded Covenant transmission from the surface before the Covenant retreat . The Iroquois heads to Reach , unwittingly bringing a Covenant tracking device with it . 
 Soon after , Keyes is given the command of the UNSC cruiser Pillar of Autumn for a secret mission ; the Spartans are to capture one of the Covenant 's religious leaders and barter a truce . Dr. Halsey also introduces John to the artificial intelligence Cortana , who would assist the Spartans by residing in their MJOLNIR armor . Before the mission can begin , however , Reach is attacked by a massive Covenant fleet . John and Cortana reach the Pillar of Autumn , but most of the other Spartans are presumed killed as the Covenant <unk> the surface of Reach , turning the landmasses into glass . Cortana initiates a slipspace course based on the ancient glyphs intercepted by the Covenant at Sigma Octanus , the course takes them to a massive ringworld known as Halo , setting the stage for the events of Halo : Combat Evolved .

 Critical reaction to the book was positive , particularly regarding the depth the book added to the Halo universe . Reviewer Eric Qualls commented that " [ it was ] interesting to read and give [ s ] you a much greater understanding " to the universe . Qualls made a positive comparison to Robert A. Heinlein 's Starship Troopers regarding the manner of story telling . GameCritics ' Brad Gallaway also praised the back @-@ story the book adds and the quality of the story . Fellow reviewer Gene Park noted the descriptions in the book went beyond what was presented in the game calling them " vibrant and rousing . " He also complimented the characters presented in the novel saying they all " fit nicely into the Halo universe " but some times there were too many characters to remember . Sal Accardo of 3D Action Planet said of the book ; " [ it ] isn ’ t going to win any Pulitzers anytime soon . It ’ s well written , and a solid page @-@ turner , but it ’ s still basically an action movie presented in book form " but praised the gritty presentation of the Spartans . Don D <unk> of the Science Fiction Chronicle called the book " competently written " , but stated the plot was " simpleminded " . 
 Though the book originally sold very slowly , it became a Publishers Weekly bestseller . The Fall of Reach would go on to sell more than 100 @,@ 000 copies by 2003 and a million copies by December 2009 . The novel 's success convinced Microsoft and Del Ray to pen a three @-@ novel publishing contract for novels based on Xbox games , including another Halo novel . The next entry in the Halo novel franchise would be 2003 's Halo : The Flood , written by William C. Dietz . The more human Chief seen in the novel led Bungie to tone down the character model in Halo 2 to make him less an exaggerated robot and more a real person inside a suit . 
 Stuart Beattie , the screenwriter of Pirates of the Caribbean : The Curse of the Black Pearl , wrote a spec script for a Fall of Reach movie . Beattie , a Halo fan , wrote the script between other projects in the hope that someone would read it and agree to produce the film but as of May 2008 there are no plans to do so . 
 In May 2010 , Tor announced that the first three Halo novels ( not originally published by Tor ) would be rereleased with new content and cover art . The Fall of Reach was the first novel to be reissued , with a release date of August 2010 .

 = Sejny Uprising = 
 The Sejny Uprising or <unk> Revolt ( Polish : <unk> <unk> , Lithuanian : <unk> <unk> ) refers to a Polish uprising against the Lithuanian authorities in August 1919 in the ethnically mixed area surrounding the town of Sejny ( Lithuanian : <unk> ) . When German forces , which occupied the territory during World War I , retreated from the area in May 1919 , they turned over administration to the Lithuanians . Trying to prevent an armed conflict between Poland and Lithuania , the Entente drew a demarcation line , known as the Foch Line . The line assigned much of the disputed Suwałki ( Suvalkai ) Region to Poland and required the Lithuanian Army to retreat . While the Lithuanians retreated from some areas , they refused to leave Sejny . Polish irregular forces began the uprising on August 23 , 1919 , and soon received support from the regular Polish Army . After several military skirmishes , Polish forces secured Sejny and Lithuanians retreated behind the Foch Line . 
 The uprising did not solve the larger border conflict between Poland and Lithuania over the ethnically mixed Suwałki Region . Both sides complained about each other 's repressive measures . The conflict intensified in 1920 , causing military skirmishes of the Polish – Lithuanian War . Sejny changed hands frequently until the Suwałki Agreement of October 1920 , which left Sejny on the Polish side . The uprising undermined the plans of Polish leader Józef Piłsudski , who was planning a coup d 'état in Lithuania to replace the Lithuanian government with a pro @-@ Polish cabinet , that would agree to a union with Poland ( the proposed Międzymorze federation ) . Because the Sejny Uprising had prompted the Lithuanian intelligence to intensify its investigations of Polish activities in Lithuania , they discovered plans for the coup and prevented it , arresting Polish sympathizers . These hostilities in Sejny further strained the Polish – Lithuanian relations . 
 Eventually , Poland and Lithuania reached an agreement on a new border that left Sejny on the Polish side of the border . The Polish – Lithuanian border in the Suwałki Region has remained the same since then ( with the exception of the World War II period ) . 
 = = Background = = 
 During the ages , the lands surrounding the town of Suwałki had been variously part of Lithuanian , Polish , and German borderlands . Since 1569 , during the era of the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth , the territory belonged to the Podlaskie Voivodeship and was part of the Kingdom of Poland rather than the Grand Duchy of Lithuania . However , Sejny was a property of Dominican friars from Vilnius . 
 During the 19th century the town was part of Russian @-@ controlled Congress Poland . During World War I the region was captured by the German Empire , which intended to incorporate the area into its province of East Prussia . After the German defeat , the victorious Entente was willing to assign the territory to either the newly independent Poland or Lithuania . The future of the region was discussed at the Paris Peace Conference in January 1919 . The Germans , whose former Ober @-@ Ost administration was preparing to evacuate , initially supported leaving the area to a Polish administration . However , as Poland was becoming an ally of France , German support gradually shifted towards Lithuania . In July 1919 , when the German troops began their slow retreat from the area , they delegated the administration to local Lithuanian authorities . Lithuanian officers and troops , who first arrived in the region in May , began to organize military units in the pre @-@ war Sejny county . 
 According to Russian statistics of 1889 , there were 57 @.@ 8 % Lithuanians , 19 @.@ 1 % Poles , and 3 @.@ 5 % Belarusians in the Suwałki Governorate . It is generally agreed that Lithuanians formed the majority population in the northern Suwałki Governorate , while Poles were concentrated in south . But , Lithuanian and Polish historians and political scientists continued to disagree over the location of the line that separated the Lithuanian from the Polish majorities . Lithuanians claimed that Sejny and the surrounding area were inhabited primarily by Lithuanians , while the Poles claimed exactly the opposite . The German census of 1916 showed that 51 % of Sejny population was Lithuanian . 
 = = Demarcation lines = = 
 In the closing days of World War I , the Conference of Ambassadors drew the first demarcation line between Poland and Lithuania on June 18 , 1919 . The line satisfied no one , and Polish troops continued to advance deeper into the Lithuanian @-@ controlled territory . These attacks coincided with the signing of the Treaty of Versailles on June 28 , which eliminated any danger from Germany . Attempting to halt further hostilities , Marshal of France Ferdinand Foch proposed a new line , known as the Foch Line , on July 18 , 1919 . 
 The Foch Line was negotiated with the Polish war mission , led by General Tadeusz Jordan @-@ Rozwadowski in Paris , while Lithuanian representatives were not invited . The Foch Line had two major modifications compared to the June 18 line : first , the entire line was moved west to give extra protection to the strategic Warsaw – Saint Petersburg Railway and second , the Suwałki Region , including the towns of Sejny , Suwałki , <unk> , was assigned to Poland . Despite assurances at the time that the line was just a temporary measure to normalize the situation before full negotiations could take place , the southern Foch Line has been regarded since then as the border between Lithuania and Poland . 
 On July 26 , the Foch Line was accepted by the Conference of Ambassadors as the provisional border between the two states . Lithuanians were not informed about this decision until August 3 . Neither country was satisfied : both Lithuanian and Polish forces would have to retreat from the Suwałki and Vilnius regions , respectively . Those Germans still present in the region also objected to the boundary of the line . The Lithuanian forces ( about 350 strong ) left the town of Suwałki by August 7 , but stopped in Sejny and formed a line at the Czarna <unk> river – <unk> Lake . Lithuanians believed that the Foch Line was not the final decision , and that they had the duty to protect Lithuanian outposts in the region .

 On August 12 , 1919 , two days after the Germans retreated from Sejny , a Polish meeting in the town attracted over 100 delegates from neighboring Polish communities ; the meeting passed a resolution that " only securing the area by Polish Army can solve the problem . " The Sejny branch of the Polish Military Organization ( PMO ) , led by Polish regular army officers Adam Rudnicki and Wacław Zawadzki , began preparing for the uprising on August 16 . PMO members and local militia volunteers numbered some 900 or 1 @,@ 200 men ( sources vary ) . The uprising was scheduled for the night of August 22 to 23 , 1919 . The date was chosen to coincide with the withdrawal of German troops from the town of Suwałki . The Poles hoped to capture the territory up to the Foch Line and advance further to take control of the towns of <unk> , Lazdijai , Kapčiamiestis as far as <unk> . 
 According to the Polish historian Tadeusz Mańczuk , Piłsudski – who was planning a coup d 'état in Kaunas – discouraged the local PMO activists from carrying out the Sejny Uprising . Piłsudski reasoned that any hostilities could leave Lithuanians even more opposed to the proposed union with Poland ( see Międzymorze ) . The local PMO disregarded his recommendations and launched the uprising . While locally successful , it led to the failure of the nationwide coup . 
 On August 17 , a Lithuanian counter @-@ demonstration was staged . Its participants read aloud a recently issued recruiting proclamation of the Lithuanian volunteer army : " Citizens ! Our nation is in danger ! To arms ! We shall leave not a single occupant on our lands ! " On August 20 , Prime Minister of Lithuania Mykolas Sleževičius visited Sejny and called on Lithuanians to defend their lands " to the end , however they can , with axes , pitchforks and scythes " . According to Lesčius , at the time the Lithuanian command in Sejny had only 260 infantry and 70 cavalry personnel , stretched along the long line of defense . There were only 10 Lithuanian guards and 20 clerical staff in the town itself . Mańczuk and <unk> note that the Polish insurgents estimated the Lithuanian forces at 1 @,@ 200 infantry ( Mańczuk also adds an estimate of 120 cavalry ) , including a 400 @-@ strong garrison in Sejny . 
 = = Military skirmishes = = 
 According to Lithuanian historian Lesčius , the first Polish assault of about 300 PMO members on August 22 was repelled , but the next day Lithuanians were forced to retreat towards Lazdijai . Over 100 Lithuanians were imprisoned in Sejny when their commander <unk> sided with the Poles . The Polish insurgents also attacked Lazdijai and Kapčiamiestis , towns on the Lithuanian side of the Foch Line . 
 In early morning of August 25 , Lithuanians counterattacked and recaptured Sejny . Polish sources claim that Lithuanians there were aided by a company of Germans volunteers , but Lithuanian sources assert that it was an excuse used by Rudnicki to explain his defeat . The Lithuanian forces recovered some important documents and property , freed Lithuanian prisoners and , according to Mańczuk , executed several of the PMO fighters they found wounded . 
 On the evening of August 25 , the first regular unit ( 41st Infantry Regiment ) of the Polish army received an order to advance towards Sejny . The Lithuanian forces retreated on the same day when they learned about approaching Polish reinforcements . According to Mańczuk , they based their retreat on an erroneous report about a " large Polish cavalry unit " operating to their rear ; only small groups of Polish partisans operated there . Later the next day , during the afternoon of August 26 , the PMO forces in Sejny were joined by the 41st Infantry Regiment . 
 On August 26 , a large anti @-@ Polish protest took place in Lazdijai , with cries to march on Sejny . The last Lithuanian attempt to retake the town was made on August 28 . The Lithuanians ( about 650 men ) were defeated by the combined forces of the Polish Army ( 800 men ) and PMO volunteers ( 500 men ) . On August 27 , the Poles officially demanded that Lithuanians retreat behind the Foch Line . On September 1 , Rudnicki announced incorporation of PMO volunteers into the 41st Infantry Regiment . During the negotiations on September 5 , representatives of the two groups agreed to settle on a detailed demarcation line ; Lithuanians agreed to retreat by September 7 . The Polish regular army units did not cross the Foch Line , and refused to aid the PMO insurgents still operating on the Lithuanian side . 
 Polish sources give total Polish casualties for the Sejny Uprising as 37 killed in action and 70 wounded . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 After the uprising , Poland repressed Lithuanian cultural life in Sejny . Lithuanian schools in Sejny ( which had some 300 pupils ) and surrounding villages were closed . The local Lithuanian clergy were evicted , and the Sejny Priest Seminary relocated . According to Lithuanians , the repressions were even more far @-@ reaching , including a ban on public use of the Lithuanian language and the closing of Lithuanian organizations , which had a total of 1 @,@ 300 members . The New York Times , reporting on renewed hostilities a year later , described the 1919 Sejny events as a violent occupation by the Poles , in which the Lithuanian inhabitants , teachers , and religious ministers were maltreated and expelled . Polish historian <unk> notes that both sides mistreated the civilian population and exaggerated reports to gain internal and foreign support . 
 The uprising contributed to the deterioration of the Polish – Lithuanian relations and further discouraged the Lithuanians from joining Piłsudski 's proposed Międzymorze federation . The Sejny Uprising doomed the Polish plan to overthrow the Lithuanian government in a coup d 'état . After the uprising , the Lithuanian police and intelligence intensified their investigation of Polish sympathizers and soon uncovered the planned coup . They made mass arrests of Polish activists from August 27 to the end of September 1919 . During the investigations , lists of PMO supporters were found ; law enforcement completely suppressed the organisation in Lithuania , arresting members . 
 Hostilities over the Suwałki Region resumed in summer 1920 . When the Polish Army began to retreat during the course of the Polish – Soviet War , the Lithuanians moved to secure what they claimed to be their new borders , set by the Soviet – Lithuanian Peace Treaty of July 1920 . The Peace Treaty granted Sejny and surrounding area to Lithuania . 
 Poland did not recognize this bilateral treaty . Ensuing tensions heightened until the outbreak of the Polish – Lithuanian War . Sejny changed hands frequently until it was controlled by Polish forces on September 22 , 1920 . The situation was legalized by the Suwałki Agreement of October 7 , 1920 , which effectively returned the town to the Polish side of the border . 
 = Henry B. Payne = 
 Henry B. Payne ( November 30 , 1810 – September 9 , 1896 ) was an American politician from Ohio . Moving to Ohio from his native New York in 1833 , he quickly established himself in law and business while becoming a local leader in Democratic politics . After serving in the Ohio Senate , Payne was elected to a single term in the United States House of Representatives in 1874 . In the House , he worked unsuccessfully for a compromise in the debate over whether all of the nation 's currency should be backed by gold . He was defeated for reelection , but served on the Electoral Commission that convened in early 1877 to resolve the dispute over the results of the 1876 presidential election . He ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1880 , but lost to Winfield Scott Hancock , who would go on to lose the general election to James A. Garfield . He was elected to the United States Senate in 1884 . His election by the Ohio legislature was tainted with charges of bribery , but after investigation by the Senate , Payne was permitted to keep his seat . In the Senate , he voted for moderate tariff reforms and against the Interstate Commerce Act of 1887 , but was otherwise a reliable Democratic vote . He did not run for reelection , and died in 1896 . 
 = = Early life and legal career = = 
 Henry Payne was born in Hamilton in Madison County , New York , in 1810 , the son of Elisha and Esther ( Douglass ) Payne . Both of his parents were Connecticut natives who had moved to New York in the 1790s . Payne attended the common schools and graduated from Hamilton College in 1832 . After graduation , Payne read law in the Canandaigua office of John C. Spencer , a Whig politician and future Secretary of War . While working there , Payne became good friends with Stephen A. Douglas , the future United States Senator and 1860 Democratic presidential candidate , who was studying law with another local attorney . 
 In 1833 , Payne moved to Cleveland , Ohio , which was then a town of just 3000 people . Douglas preceded him there , but was ill , and Payne 's first task on arrival in Ohio was to nurse his friend back to health . He continued to study law , this time under Sherlock J. Andrews and in 1834 was admitted to the bar . He opened his own practice the same year , forming a partnership with future United States federal judge Hiram V. Willson . The firm became successful quickly , and within ten years Payne and Willson was among the top firms in Ohio . In 1836 , Payne married Mary Perry , the only child of a wealthy local merchant . They had six children , including Oliver Hazard Payne , the Gilded Age businessman , and Nathan P. Payne , a future mayor of Cleveland . 
 = = Business career = = 
 Payne 's law practice continued to be successful through the early 1840s , but after suffering from attacks of hemoptysis ( bleeding in the lungs ) , he was forced to curtail his activities . Instead , he devoted his time to business affairs and local politics . He began to promote the extension of railroads into Cleveland . Along with a few associates , Payne founded the Cleveland and Columbus Railroad in 1851 , and served as its president . He also invested in several other local railroads . He resigned the railroad presidency in 1854 , but the following year became president of a different railroad , the Painesville and Ashtabula . That same year , Payne became one of Cleveland 's first water works commissioners . He also invested in real estate , and in 1888 arranged for the construction of the Perry @-@ Payne Building in the present @-@ day Warehouse District . 
 = = Ohio politics = = 
 Payne entered local politics as a Democrat , serving as a Presidential elector in 1848 for Democratic nominees Lewis Cass and William Orlando Butler . He was elected to the Cleveland City Council in 1849 , and served there until 1854 . At the same time , he was a member of the Ohio Senate from 1849 to 1851 . His skill as a parliamentarian led his party to nominate him for the United States Senate in 1851 , but the election went to Whig candidate , Benjamin Wade , by a vote of 44 – 34 . Payne attended the 1856 Democratic National Convention , where he worked successfully for the nomination of James Buchanan . He ran for Governor of Ohio in 1857 , but narrowly lost to the incumbent Republican , Salmon P. Chase . With more than 300 @,@ 000 votes cast , Payne fell short of victory by just 1 @,@ 503 . In 1860 , he again attended the Democrats ' convention , where he helped nominate his old friend Stephen A. Douglas , and sided with Douglas 's faction as the party divided into northern and southern halves . 
 At the 1860 convention , Payne denounced the right of secession , and during the Civil War that began the next year , he was a staunch supporter of the Union . Although he was not an abolitionist , he opposed the further extension of slavery . During the war , Payne used some of his wealth to help equip Ohio regiments . He was 50 years old when the war began , too old to volunteer himself , but two of his sons served in the Union Army with his blessing . After the war , Payne continued his political activity , leading the Ohio delegation to the 1872 Democratic National Convention , where he supported the eventual nominee , Horace Greeley . He campaigned on Greeley 's behalf , raising his own political profile in the process . In 1874 , Payne ran for a seat in the United States House of Representatives from Ohio 's 20th district , and was elected with a 2500 @-@ vote majority over the incumbent Republican , Richard C. Parsons . 
 = = House of Representatives = = 
 When the 44th United States Congress assembled , the House was controlled by the Democrats for the first time since the Civil War . Payne was placed on the Banking and Currency Committee and the Committee for the Reform of Civil Service . At the time , the currency circulating in the United States was a mix of gold @-@ backed dollars and " greenbacks " that were backed only by the credit of the United States , with the public considering greenbacks to be worth less than gold dollars . The previous Congress , controlled by Republicans , had passed the Specie Payment Resumption Act , which would return the United States to the gold standard by 1879 . Opinion among Democrats was split , with Eastern Democrats supporting the Act , and Western and Southern members hoping for its repeal . 
 Payne drew up a compromise bill , in which the Resumption Act would be repealed and replaced with a gradual , partial return to gold @-@ backed money . Under the Payne Act , national banks would be required to build up gold reserves equal to three percent of the value of greenbacks in circulation that year , adding an additional three percent each year until 1885 , when they would have gold reserves of thirty percent of the value of circulating greenbacks . At that point , greenbacks would become redeemable in at least thirty percent gold . This compromise was still too much for the Eastern Democrats and Republicans who favored the gold standard , and the Banking Committee refused to approve the bill . Payne contrived to bypass his committee and bring the bill for a vote by the whole House , but it was voted down , 81 to 157 . The House later passed a complete repeal of the Resumption Act , 133 to 120 , but the Senate declined to take up the matter . Specie resumption remained the law of the land when the 44th Congress 's term expired . 
 In the 1876 presidential election , Republican Rutherford B. Hayes of Ohio defeated Democrat Samuel J. Tilden of New York in one of the most hotly contested presidential elections to that time in the nation 's history . The results initially indicated a Democratic victory , but the electoral votes of several states were ardently disputed until mere days before the new president was to be inaugurated . Members of both parties in Congress agreed to convene a bipartisan Electoral Commission , which ultimately decided the race for Hayes . Payne was named to the committee at Tilden 's request , but the results went against the Democrats as Hayes was declared the winner of the disputed votes . After the Commissions result , Payne joined many Democrats in attempting to delay the House proceedings in hopes of forcing a more favorable result , but was outvoted by Republicans and the Democrats who sided with Speaker Samuel J. Randall in accepting the Commission 's result . The effort failed , and Hayes became president on March 4 , 1877 . 
 = = Presidential politics = = 
 Payne ran for reelection in 1876 but was defeated by Republican Amos Townsend . He remained involved in politics , however , and even considered running for the Democratic nomination for President in 1880 . Tilden , while not officially a candidate , wielded a heavy influence over the convention . Tilden was ambiguous about his willingness to participate in another campaign , leading some delegates to defect to other candidates , while others stayed loyal to their old standard @-@ bearer . Tilden did tell some of his close supporters that , if he did not run , Payne would be his first choice and House Speaker Samuel J. Randall his second . With that , many of the Tilden loyalists pledged their support to Payne , at least until Tilden decided to enter the race . Although Tilden ultimately declined to be nominated , Payne 's chances were hindered when Ohio 's delegation remained loyal to Senator Allen G. Thurman . Although Payne place third on the convention 's first ballot , on the second the delegates stampeded to General Winfield Scott Hancock , who was nominated .

 In 1884 , the Democrats held a majority in the Ohio legislature . In a caucus meeting to determine the party 's choice for United States Senator , many Democratic legislators looked to replace the incumbent Senator , Democrat George H. Pendleton , because they disagreed with his advocacy of civil service reform and low tariffs . Some of Pendleton 's opponents , led by Oliver Payne , promoted Henry Payne for the Senate seat , recalling his opposition to both of those positions during his time in the House . After a secret ballot by the Democratic caucus , Payne received 46 out of 80 votes . Because Oliver was a trustee and treasurer of the Standard Oil company , many of the Pendleton supporters immediately alleged that $ 100 @,@ 000 from the oil trust had been used to bribe Democratic legislators , and claimed that an open ballot would not have favored Payne . 
 When the full legislature met , Payne was elected with 78 votes out of 120 . The Democratic legislature initially refused to investigate their members ' alleged corruption , but when Republicans regained the majority in the next session , the legislature looked into the allegations and forwarded the results to the federal Senate . The evidence gathered was voluminous , but the Senate declined to expel Payne , who proclaimed his innocence . While there was never enough evidence for definitive proof of bribery , biographer Dewayne Burke wrote that the " circumstantial evidence seems to convict Payne " of the charge . 
 = = = Tariffs and interstate commerce = = = 
 In the Senate , the most prominent fight was over the need for a strong protective tariff , which made foreign goods more expensive but encouraged domestic manufacturing . Payne supported a high tariff , but thought some small reductions would be prudent in order to reduce the federal government 's surplus . He joined fellow Senate Democrats in rejecting a tariff bill proposed by Iowa Republican William B. Allison , which would have raised the rates even higher than Payne thought prudent . His only contribution to the debate was to argue against a reduction in the tariff on steel and iron . This Allison bill passed the Republican @-@ controlled Senate , but failed to pass in the House , which was controlled by Democrats . 
 At the same time , the regulation of interstate commerce , especially as concerned the railroads , was a political issue . The call for regulation of the railroads divided the nation 's business interests , with railroads working against legislation and manufacturers , who were aggrieved by high railroad rates , joining the reformers . Standard Oil joined the latter group in calling for Congressional action . In 1886 , Payne voted for a bill that would reform railroad rates slightly , but was considered ineffective by reformers . After amendments by the House , however , the bill returned to the Senate with more substantive prohibitions on the practices consumers and manufacturers found most egregious . Payne voted against the strengthened Interstate Commerce Act , which passed and was signed into law by President Grover Cleveland . In explaining his vote , Payne said that the law was impractical and unfairly advantaged other methods of shipping ( such as boat transportation on the Great Lakes ) over the railroads .

 Monzambano was a torpedo cruiser of the Goito class built for the Italian Regia Marina ( Royal Navy ) in the 1880s . The ship was built at the Arsenale di La Spezia , beginning with her keel laying in August 1885 and ending with her completion in August 1889 . She was armed with a variety of light guns and five 14 @-@ inch ( 356 mm ) torpedo tubes , and was capable of a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . The ship spent her career in the main Italian fleet conducting training exercises , and did not see action . She spent 1898 patrolling the eastern Mediterranean Sea with the Levant Squadron . Monzambano was withdrawn from service in 1901 and broken up for scrap that year .

In 1893 , Monzambano was laid up in La Spezia for the year , along with several other torpedo cruisers of the Partenope class , her sister Goito , and Pietro <unk> ; at the time , the Italian fleet mobilized only a handful of vessels for the annual training maneuvers , preferring to keep the most modern vessels in reserve to reduce maintenance costs . That year , Monzambano was activated for the major fleet maneuvers conducted in July with the 1st Division , with the ironclad battleships Lepanto and Ruggiero di Lauria , the torpedo cruiser Euridice , and four torpedo boats . She served in the attacking squadron during a set of exercises that simulated a French attack on Naples . 
 In 1895 , Monzambano was stationed in the 2nd Maritime Department , split between Taranto and Naples , along with most of the torpedo cruisers in the Italian fleet .

Principal Figgins ( Iqbal Theba ) plans an assembly to warn the students about the dangers on underage drinking , and asks glee club director Will Schuester ( Matthew Morrison ) to have his students perform a song that send positive messages about avoiding alcohol . Rachel Berry ( Lea Michele ) throws a party for the glee club students where almost everyone gets drunk ; the partygoers wake up to hangovers , and must perform various songs about alcohol while still under the influence . The assembly ends abruptly when a song that seems to glorify alcohol is interrupted by two of the singers vomiting over the others , which scares the entire high school into avoiding drunkenness . 
 " Blame It on the Alcohol " was given a positive reception by many reviewers , though there was disagreement over the show 's messages , including with regard to drinking alcohol . Rachel 's party was lauded , as was the song performed during it , " Don 't You Want Me " ; the assembly song , Kesha 's " Tik Tok " , was also well received . This episode featured cover versions of four songs , which were all released as singles and made available for digital download . Three of the singles debuted on the Billboard Hot 100 .

 = = Plot = = 
 Concerned about recent underage drinking incidents at McKinley High , Principal Figgins ( Iqbal Theba ) schedules a cautionary assembly and commissions the glee club to perform a song about the dangers of alcohol . Lead singer Rachel ( Lea Michele ) sings a song she has written , about her headband , to Finn ( Cory Monteith ) ; she realizes that she needs inspiration to write a song for Regionals , so she throws a house party for the club , which is also attended by former member Kurt ( Chris Colfer ) and his crush Blaine ( Darren Criss ) . The attendees — except for Kurt and Finn — get drunk , and Rachel and Blaine share a long kiss during a game of Spin the Bottle , after which they perform " Don 't You Want Me " as a karaoke duet . Blaine spends the night in Kurt 's bed , fully clothed . Kurt 's father Burt ( Mike O 'Malley ) is not pleased about this level of intimacy under his roof and tells Kurt to ask for permission first next time . Kurt grudgingly agrees , but asks Burt to educate himself on gay relationships so Kurt can come to him for advice in the future . 
 On Monday , the glee club members arrive at school hung over , and perform the song " Blame It " . Club director Will Schuester ( Matthew Morrison ) is impressed with their " realistic acting " , but thinks the song is inappropriate for the assembly as it glorifies drinking . Football coach Shannon Beiste ( Dot @-@ Marie Jones ) prevails on Will to join her in a night out at a cowboy bar to reduce their stress ; they perform the song " One Bourbon , One Scotch , One Beer " . Will gets drunk and once home , his intoxication is such that he marks all his students ' papers with an " A + " , and then drunk dials the school 's guidance counselor Emma Pillsbury ( Jayma Mays ) and leaves a sexually tinged message . 
 Rachel asks Blaine out , and to Kurt 's dismay he accepts . They argue , as Blaine suggests he might be bisexual , while Kurt denies the existence of bisexuality . Kurt visits Rachel after the date , and warns Rachel that Blaine is indeed gay , if temporarily confused . At the assembly , New Directions perform Kesha 's " Tik Tok " , but the song comes to an abrupt end when Brittany ( Heather Morris ) and Santana ( Naya Rivera ) throw up from intoxication . Figgins later rewards the club for their performance 's success in scaring their fellow students into sobriety , in the belief that the glee club had been acting during the assembly . Cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester ( Jane Lynch ) publicly humiliates Will by playing the message he left on her voice mail — not Emma 's , as he had meant to do — over the school 's public address system while classes are in session . Will realizes that it is hypocritical to tell the students not to abuse alcohol when he does so himself , and convinces the entire club to pledge not to drink until after their upcoming Nationals competition . He tells them he will also abstain , and urges them to call him for a ride home if they do drink , regardless of where they are or how late it is . 
 At the Lima Bean , Rachel kisses a sober Blaine , which makes him realize he is indeed gay , but instead of being disappointed she is elated : she tells Kurt that her relationship with a man who turned out to be gay is " songwriting gold " .

 " Blame It on the Alcohol " was written by co @-@ creator Ian Brennan and directed by Eric Stoltz in his second time as a Glee director , his first outing having been the acclaimed fourth episode of the season , " Duets " . 
 A blind item about a " popular gay character " wondering if he might be bisexual after an " encounter " was published on February 10 , 2011 , by Michael Ausiello , Editor in Chief of the entertainment news website TVLine . A " firestorm of speculation " was set off , and centered on Blaine . Glee showrunner and co @-@ creator Ryan Murphy sent an email to the Perez Hilton website , published on February 14 , that stated , " Blaine is NOT bi . He is gay , and will always be gay . I think it 's very important to young kids that they know this character is one of them . " 
 Within a couple of hours , Michael Jensen of the gay website AfterElton.com took note of Murphy 's statement , and also of the then @-@ current cover article on Criss in Out magazine , in which Murphy was quoted as saying , " Blaine will openly question whether bisexuality is real . I think that some people will love that discussion and some will not love it . " Jensen pointed out that Murphy does not say that Blaine will not question his own sexuality , but clearly " decides he is , in fact , gay " . Ausiello posted at about that time that Blaine was indeed who he was referring to in his original story , quoted from the same Out article as Jensen , and added a new one @-@ sentence summation from Murphy on the coming episode : " I guess the moral of the story is don ’ t play spin the bottle while drunk on wine coolers . " 
 The show 's first original song was included in the episode : " My Headband " , sung by — and ostensibly written by — Rachel . In actuality , the song was written by Brennan , who wrote the episode , and composer James Scott Levine . 
 The episode featured cover versions of " Don 't You Want Me " by The Human League , sung by Criss and Michele ; " One Bourbon , One Scotch , One Beer " by Rudy Toombs , as recorded by George Thorogood , sung by Morrison and Jones ; " Tik Tok " by Kesha , performed by Morris and New Directions , and " Blame It " by Jamie Foxx and T @-@ Pain in a rendition by New Directions with Amber Riley and Kevin McHale as leads .

 Reaction to the episode was split . While the majority of reviewers were favorably impressed , some very much so , a significant minority were disappointed at the message the episode conveyed and the storytelling decisions . Among the former were Kevin Fallon of The Atlantic , who described it as " Glee at its best : cartoonish , outlandish , and loud — but still oh @-@ so true to life . " IGN 's Robert Canning gave the episode a " great " rating of 8 out of 10 , and called the main storyline " comical and human " . Candace Bulter of ScreenCrave also gave the episode an 8 out of 10 , and wrote , " This week 's Glee puts on the beer goggles to put alcohol @-@ related issues in perspective . The result is humorous and ironic , but leaves something to be wanted . " Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club , wrote that " the underpinnings of the episode aren 't terrible , just overstuffed " and gave it a " B − " . MTV 's Aly Semigran stated that the episode " left something of a sour taste " , and added that while the show " always combines humor with serious life lessons , it seems there were none to be found here " ; she called the episode " a wasted opportunity " . BuddyTV 's Jen Harper was also disenchanted by the episode , and concluded , " Geez Louise , Glee . What 's happened to you ? " Amy Reiter of The Los Angeles Times saw the show 's message differently from Semigran , and wrote , " Leave it to Glee to tackle a potentially joyless , didactic topic like teenage drinking and somehow manage to entertain and surprise and get its important life lessons across . " Time 's Richard Corliss called it a " breezy , sharply written episode " and rated it in the " high @-@ middle range " for the show . He concluded , " Last night ’ s hour of Glee was of the level a superior series sticks in mid @-@ season between its ' important ' episodes . If this is coasting , take me along for the ride . " 
 The scenes that featured Rachel 's party were acclaimed by most reviewers . Fallon called them " a parade of the funniest sight gags , most uninhibited acting , and — interestingly enough — most relatable scenes Glee has produced in a while " , and described Michele as " an acting stand out " who " handled the entire arc like a seasoned comedienne " . His colleague Meghan Brown said it " showed Glee at its best " , and added : " The dialogue was snappy , the group dynamic was clean and specific , and the kids seemed like actual kids . " VanDerWerff also pointed out that the club members " really felt like kids , not like miniature 30 @-@ somethings " , and said the party was the " best part " of the episode . Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone praised Finn 's breakdown of " the five drunk girl archetypes , as demonstrated by the glee girls " . Harper wrote that the party scenes " left a lot to be desired " , and Patrick Burns , the third reviewer from The Atlantic , " waited for the Glee party to get out of control , or for someone to get hurt so that America 's youth could be shocked and appalled by the dangers of drinking " , but " the worst thing that happened was that Rachel tried to flip a gay guy " . 
 Kurt 's scenes with Blaine and with his father evoked very divergent opinions from reviewers . Canning made mention of " a great conversation between Blaine and Kurt that felt very real for kids in this situation " and noted he was " glad it wasn 't an easy talk for either of them " . The Houston Chronicle 's Bobby Hankinson agreed , and said of their " debate over the existence of bisexuality " that " it was refreshing to see Glee portray a conversation like it really goes down in reality . It ’ s also good to see them not treat Kurt like such a saint all the time . " Semigran wrote that Kurt showed " an unflattering side of himself " , and Gonzalez stated that she " was completely on Blaine 's side here " : Kurt " wasn 't fair " and " was sort of unlikable " for once , though she did add that " he 's allowed to be flawed " . Blaine 's " sudden confusion over his sexual orientation " was deemed a " false note " by Reiter , who called his " overwrought speech " at the Lima Bean " off @-@ key " . Harper was unhappy that " major plot points like a gay character thinking he might be bi or straight get instigated , sorted out and wrapped up within an hour " , and said she thought it was " hurtful " for Blaine to " accept a date with Kurt 's friend " after he and Kurt had " agreed to sort of work on a potential relationship between the two of them " in the " Silly Love Songs " episode . 
 There were similar reactions to Kurt 's scene with Burt , though reviewers agreed that Burt was being reasonable and Kurt was not . Gonzalez characterized Kurt as " more flawed in this episode than he has been , especially in that scene with his dad when he kept taking offense to his dad 's <unk> guidelines for sleepovers " , and Semigran described " Kurt 's overreaction " as " even more unsettling " than his argument with Blaine . Corliss wrote that Kurt 's " smackdown of his father has the odor of propaganda from the gayest show in TV history " . Canning said he was " moved by Kurt asking his father to step out of his comfort zone and educate himself about what is gay men do when [ they 're ] together " , and Gonzalez enjoyed " the very realistic tension that exists between them as father and gay son " . 
 Harper was harshly critical of " the inane story line " where Sue regularly accused Will of being an alcoholic , which Semigran also took exception to . Reiter characterized " Sue throwing Aural Intensity 's ' chipper homosexual ' choir director down the stairs , twice " as a " false note " and said it was " particularly difficult to take " , though VanDerWerff called it " kind of funny " . Semigran was one reviewer who noted that Mercedes was wrong when she " complains that there are no songs that convey alcohol is bad " . She suggested " Pink 's ' Sober ' or Pearl Jam 's haunting cover of ' Last Kiss ' or Simple Plan 's moving ' ( Untitled ) How Could This Happen to Me ? ' " as songs that New Directions could have done for the assembly . 
 = = = Music and performances = = = 
 The musical covers and performances for the episode were given a mostly positive reception by reviewers . Rachel and Blaine 's duet of " Don 't You Want Me " was called " the best number of the episode " by VanDerWerff . Semigran went further and said it was the " best number by far " , and Hankinson went beyond that : " it may be one of my favorite <unk> of all time " . Futterman called it " fun " and " flirty " , and noted that " it pits Glee 's most well @-@ rounded pop vocalists against each other " . Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times and Gonzalez both gave the performance an " A " ; Benigno wrote that " it sounds like a modernized version of an old song and it totally , 1000 % works " , and Gonzalez declared that " Blaine needs to join New Directions so we can get more duets between him and Rachel " . Harper , while she characterized it as a " really cute duet " , said she was " not super @-@ keen on seeing them pair up again " . Brett Berk of Vanity Fair was even less enthusiastic , and gave it two stars out of five . 
 Berk was more enthusiastic about " Blame It " and gave it four stars out of five ; he wrote , " This should be the song they sing at Nationals " . Gonzalez called it " one of the better R & B performances we 've seen from the Glee gang in a while " , and gave it an " A " . Billboard 's Katie Morgan thought that " this version might be better than the original " , while Harper was quite sure , and declared that it was " way better than the Jamie Foxx version " . Futterman , though she described it as a " very informed rendition " , said that " the song was too clean @-@ scrubbed to pass for a dirty club hit " . Benigno , while he liked " the harmonies in the hook " , said the song was " very skippable " and gave it a " B " . VanDerWerff said it was " one of the least enjoyable numbers of this season " . 
 Benigno gave a " B + " to " One Bourbon , One Scotch , One Beer " . He noted that " Glee can slum with the best of ' em when the occasion calls for it " , and added " it 's the total lack of irony that ends up making this one so good " . Gonzalez was " prepared to hate " the song , but that Jones and Morrison clearly " had fun recording this song " , and since " country is 70 percent attitude " , she ultimately gave it a " B " . Bulter wrote that she " can ’ t wait for more of Beiste ’ s alto country vibes to be showcased " . 
 Morris as Brittany was lauded for her performance in " Tik Tok " , which Bulter called the " performance of the night " and praised her " mad dance skills and awesome vocals " . Reiter wrote that Brittany " owned that rendition " , and CNN 's Lisa Respers France gave " kudos to Brittany for her awesome performance " . Benigno gave the song an " A − " , noted that Morris has a better voice than the original artist , Kesha , and the rendition was a case of " a bunch of really talented kids making a simple song better " . Futterman praised the " dance @-@ centered performance " , but said she wished Rachel or Mercedes had sung lead . VanDerWerff " really liked " Morris on the number , but said he " didn 't buy " that it was the song selected for the assembly .

 Vernon Edgell Bickford ( August 17 , 1920 – May 6 , 1960 ) was an American professional baseball player . A right @-@ handed starting pitcher , he played six seasons in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) for the Boston / Milwaukee Braves from 1948 to 1953 in the National League , and one game for the Baltimore Orioles of the American League in 1954 . 
 Bickford was born in Kentucky but raised in West Virginia . He began his professional career in 1939 and , after serving in World War II , made the majors in 1949 . Acquired by the Braves organization due to a flip of a coin , Bickford became one of the most promising National League pitchers during his playing career , earning All @-@ Star honors in 1949 and leading the National League in complete games in 1950 . However his career was soon shorted by multiple arm injuries , and he was out of baseball by 1955 . After working an assortment of jobs , he was diagnosed with stomach cancer in 1960 and died after a three @-@ month illness . 
 He is best known for throwing a no @-@ hitter against the Brooklyn Dodgers on August 11 , 1950 .

 Bickford was born in <unk> , Kentucky and raised in <unk> , West Virginia . He began playing semi @-@ professional baseball in 1939 for a local West Virginian team , before signing with the Welch Minors of the Class @-@ D Mountain State League the same year . He served three years in the armed forces during World War II where he later claimed " helped " improve his career , as he got pitching tips from several professional Major League ballplayers . 
 = = Minor league career = = 
 Bickford was groomed to be a relief pitcher in minor league baseball and played four seasons with the Welch Minors before going off to fight in World War II . He came back to the Braves system in 1946 where he played for the Jackson Senators of the Southeastern League , where he had a 10 – 12 win @-@ loss record with a 3 @.@ 33 earned run average ( ERA ) , and one game with the Hartford Chiefs of the Eastern League . 
 He was promoted to the Indianapolis Indians of the American Association for the 1947 campaign when Indianapolis owner Frank McKinney bought controlling interest in the Pittsburgh Pirates organization . Allegedly , Bickford stayed as part of the Braves organization due to a flip of a coin at a local bar . An argument endured between McKinney , Braves president Lou Perini and Braves general manager John Quinn during spring training over the fate of the players in the organization , with McKinney wanting to move Indianapolis and all its players to the Pirates organization . Via a gentleman 's agreement , they decided to split the players with a flip of a coin . They flipped a coin for the first selection , similar to a sports draft . If the coin landed heads , the player was headed to the Pirates organization and if it landed tails they stayed in Braves organization . The coin landed on tails , and the Braves picked Bickford and took over his contract . Perini later recalled on why he selected Bickford . Brooklyn 's general manager Branch Rickey had interest in the young right @-@ hander , and Perini thought that " if Bickford was good enough for Rickey , he was good enough for the Braves " . Bickford played for the Milwaukee Brewers in 1947 , where he had a 9 – 5 win @-@ loss record with a 3 @.@ 78 earned run average in 29 games , 14 of which were starts . 
 = = Major League career = = 
 Bickford was expected to start the 1948 season in the minor leagues due to lack of control . However , a friend of Boston Braves manager Billy Southworth stated that Bickford was likely better as a starting pitcher and reached the major league roster . His Major League debut was on April 24 , 1948 in a 16 – 9 loss against the New York Giants . He entered in relief at the top of the fourth inning , after Al Lyons gave up three earned runs to start the inning . He got Sid Gordon to hit to a double play and after giving up a single to Johnny Mize , he retired Willard Marshall on a grounder to end the inning . He made his first career start against the Pirates , a 4 – 1 victory on May 19 in which he only gave up five hits . On June 7 , he pitched a four @-@ hitter in an 11 – 1 victory over the Chicago Cubs , throwing five perfect innings before giving up a hit to Dick Culler to start the sixth inning . He finished with an 11 – 5 mark and a 3 @.@ 27 earned run average as the Braves won the National League pennant and advanced to the 1948 World Series against the Cleveland Indians . In his only World Series appearance , he started Game 3 , where he gave up one run on four hits in 3 @.@ 1 innings pitched and was charged with the loss .

 In 1949 , Bickford went 16 – 11 with a 4 @.@ 25 earned run average and made the National League All @-@ Star team . He finished seventh in the league in complete games ( 15 ) and third in games started ( 36 ) behind teammate Warren Spahn and Ken Raffensberger of the Cincinnati Reds . He lost a no @-@ hitter in the ninth inning in one of those games . At season 's end Bickford , alongside Spahn and teammate Johnny Sain created one of the most formidable pitching trios in the league for the next several years . 
 His best season statistical @-@ wise came in 1950 , when he went 19 – 14 with a 3 @.@ 47 earned run average and led the National League in games started ( 39 ) , complete games ( 27 ) , innings pitched ( 311 @.@ 2 ) and batters faced ( 1 @,@ 325 ) . He also finished eighth in the league with 126 strikeouts . The high point of his career was his 7 – 0 no @-@ hitter against the Brooklyn Dodgers on August 11 , the first no @-@ hitter in the Major Leagues since Rex Barney threw one for Brooklyn in 1948 , and the first one for the Braves since Jim Tobin in 1944 . He retired the first 10 batters before walking Gene <unk> in the fourth inning . Overall he walked four batters , and Duke Snider hit into a double play to end the game . Afterwards , Bickford stated that " all he wanted was the game " . His no @-@ hitter helped stay the Braves in the pennant race , falling five games behind the Philadelphia Phillies . However the Braves faltered and finished fourth with an 83 – 79 record , eight games behind the Phillies in the standings . Bickford struggled near the end of the year , falling short in his six games in an attempt to record a 20 win season .

 In 1951 , he had an 11 – 9 win @-@ loss record with a career low 3 @.@ 12 earned run average in 25 games . His 3 @.@ 12 earned run average was good for eighth in the league . However , Bickford broke a finger in 1951 after being hit by a line drive , missed most of the final three months of the season and never regained his prior form . In 1952 , he was 7 – 12 with a 3 @.@ 74 earned run average in 26 games , 22 of them starts . He played for the Braves when the team moved to Milwaukee before the 1953 season ; however , he suffered from bone spurs in his pitching arm .

 In 1954 , Bickford was sold to the Baltimore Orioles for an undisclosed amount of cash and catcher Charlie White . The New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox were both interested in Bickford 's services , but general manager John Quinn decided to go with Baltimore 's offer . He only played one game , a start against the Chicago White Sox on April 24 . He gave up five runs , four of them earned , in four innings before being credited with the 14 – 4 loss . A pinched nerve in his throwing arm and eventual elbow surgery shortened his career .

 U.S. Route 15 ( US 15 ) is a part of the U.S. Highway System that runs from <unk> , South Carolina to Painted Post , New York . In Maryland , the highway runs 37 @.@ 85 miles ( 60 @.@ 91 km ) from the Virginia state line at the Potomac River in Point of Rocks north to the Pennsylvania state line near Emmitsburg . Known for most of its length as Catoctin Mountain Highway , US 15 is the primary north – south highway of Frederick County . The highway connects the county seat of Frederick with Point of Rocks , Leesburg , Virginia , and Charles Town , West Virginia ( via US 340 ) , to the south and with Thurmont , Emmitsburg , and Gettysburg , Pennsylvania , to the north . US 15 is a four @-@ lane divided highway throughout the state except for the portion between the Point of Rocks Bridge and the highway 's junction with US 340 near Jefferson . The U.S. Highway is a freeway along its concurrency with US 340 and through Frederick , where the highway meets US 40 and Interstate 70 ( I @-@ 70 ) . US 15 has an unsigned business route through Emmitsburg . 
 US 15 is the descendent of a pair of turnpikes that connected Frederick with Emmitsburg to the north and Buckeystown to the south . These turnpikes were reconstructed as state roads in the 1910s north of Frederick and in the early 1920s from Frederick south to Tuscarora . When US 15 was assigned in 1927 , the Tuscarora – Point of Rocks highway had yet to be improved ; this section was paved in the early 1930s . The modern Point of Rocks Bridge was built in the late 1930s after its predecessor was destroyed in a flood . The Frederick Freeway was constructed in the 1950s . US 15 was relocated to part of the freeway ; the old route of the U.S. Highway through downtown Frederick became part of Maryland Route 355 ( MD 355 ) . US 15 's present highway between Point of Rocks and Jefferson was constructed in the late 1960s ; the old road south of Frederick was replaced with MD 28 and MD 85 . North of Frederick , the U.S. Highway bypassed Thurmont and Emmitsburg in the late 1950s and mid @-@ 1960s , respectively . US 15 was upgraded to a divided highway north of Frederick in the early 1980s . 
 = = Route description = = 
 US 15 has several official designations throughout its course in Maryland . The U.S. Highway is known as Catoctin Mountain Highway from the Virginia state line at Point of Rocks north to US 340 near Jefferson and from MD 26 in Frederick north to the Pennsylvania state line near Emmitsburg . US 15 is also part of Jefferson National Pike along its freeway concurrency with US 340 and the Frederick Freeway between US 340 and MD 26 . In July 2004 , the Maryland General Assembly designated the highway the 115th Infantry Regiment Memorial Highway ; a marker honoring the 115th Infantry Regiment was completed in the median of US 15 in Emmitsburg in July 2006 . All of US 15 except the portion between Catoctin Furnace and Thurmont is part of the Catoctin Mountain Scenic Byway , which was designated a National Scenic Byway in September 2005 . The entire length of the highway in Maryland is part of the National Highway System .

 US 15 enters Maryland at Point of Rocks , named for the pair of mountain peaks between which the Potomac River cuts through Catoctin Mountain , Pine Rock in Maryland and Furnace Mountain in Loudoun County , Virginia . The highway crosses the river on the Point of Rocks Bridge , a two @-@ lane , eight @-@ span camelback truss bridge that also passes over the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal and CSX 's Metropolitan Subdivision on the Maryland side of the river . Just north of the bridge , US 15 meets the western terminus of MD 28 ( Clay Street ) , which serves as the main street of the community of Point of Rocks . The U.S. Highway heads north as a two @-@ lane controlled @-@ access road that passes through a mix of farmland and forest on the eastern flank of Catoctin Mountain . North of its roundabout at MD 464 ( Point of Rocks Road ) , US 15 has only two intersections , with <unk> Road and <unk> Road , before passing under Elmer Derr Road and reaching a partial interchange with US 340 ( Jefferson National Pike ) east of Jefferson . There is no direct access from northbound US 15 to westbound US 340 or from eastbound US 340 to southbound US 15 ; that access is provided by using the Mt . Zion Road interchange to get turned around . 
 US 15 and US 340 run concurrently northeast toward Frederick as a four @-@ lane freeway . The two highways have a diamond interchange with Mt . Zion Road and cross over Ballenger Creek . On the southwest side of Frederick , the freeway has a partial interchange with I @-@ 70 ( Eisenhower Memorial Highway ) , a folded diamond interchange with MD 180 ( Jefferson Pike ) , and a partial cloverleaf interchange with the Frederick Freeway , which carries US 40 through the interchange . US 340 's eastern terminus is within the third interchange , where US 15 exits north onto the Frederick Freeway and Jefferson Street continues east toward downtown Frederick . 
 US 15 continues north concurrent with US 40 along the six @-@ lane Frederick Freeway . US 40 exits the freeway at a partial cloverleaf interchange with Patrick Street , which heads east toward downtown Frederick and west through the heavily commercialized Golden Mile . US 15 crosses Carroll Creek and continues north with four lanes through folded diamond interchanges with Rosemont Avenue , 7th Street , and Motter Avenue . All three streets provide access to Fort Detrick , home of the United States Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases . In addition , Rosemont Avenue leads to Hood College and Motter Avenue connects the freeway with Frederick Community College . The Frederick Freeway ends at US 15 's partial interchange with MD 26 ( Liberty Road ) . 
 = = = Frederick to Emmitsburg = = = 
 US 15 continues north as a four @-@ lane controlled @-@ access expressway that has directional crossover intersections with Hayward Road and Monocacy Boulevard before leaving the city of Frederick by crossing Tuscarora Creek . The highway parallels the Monocacy River and has a junction with Biggs Ford Road on its way north to the hamlet of <unk> , where the U.S. Highway intersects Old Frederick Road . US 15 crosses Fishing Creek to the west of Lewistown and is closely paralleled on the west by Auburn Road as the highway gradually approaches the eastern flank of Catoctin Mountain . At the northern end of Auburn Road , MD 806 ( Catoctin Furnace Road ) begins to parallel the northbound side of the U.S. Highway , which follows the eastern boundary of Cunningham Falls State Park just west of the village of Catoctin Furnace . Access to the main section of the state park is provided by Catoctin Hollow Road , which intersects the southbound lanes of US 15 and follows Little Hunting Creek up the mountain . The park 's Manor Area is accessible from US 15 a short distance north of Catoctin Hollow Road . 
 North of its intersection with Blue Mountain Road and Pryor Road , US 15 leaves the park boundary and enters the town of Thurmont . The U.S. Highway has a diamond interchange with unnamed and unsigned MD 15C that leads to the northern end of MD 806 and to Frederick Road , which serves a commercial area south of downtown Thurmont . US 15 continues north to a folded diamond interchange with MD 77 ( Main Street ) where the highway also crosses Hunting Creek ; MD 77 follows the creek up the mountain as <unk> Road toward Catoctin Mountain Park . The highway intersects Sandy Spring Lane ( unsigned MD 15D ) and crosses over the Maryland Midland Railroad . US 15 leaves the town of Thurmont and meets MD 550 ( Church Street ) at a diamond interchange before crossing Owens Creek , which MD 550 follows up the mountain as <unk> Road . The U.S. Highway heads northeast through farmland and meets the northern end of MD 76 ( <unk> Station Road ) before bisecting the campus of Mount St. Mary 's University . The main part of the campus and National Shrine Grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes are located to the west of the highway ; the athletic complex , which includes Knott Arena , is to the east . 
 North of Mount St. Mary 's University , US 15 meets the southern end of unsigned US 15 Business ( Seton Avenue ) at a superstreet intersection that also serves Old Frederick Road ; U @-@ turn ramps on either side of the intersection provide the missing movements . The U.S. Highway crosses Toms Creek and Flat Run along the eastern side of the town of Emmitsburg before its interchange with MD 140 ( Main Street ) . MD 140 is accessed via a pair of right @-@ in / right @-@ out interchanges with Emmit Gardens Drive , which is unsigned MD <unk> on the northbound side of US 15 and MD <unk> on the southbound side . North of MD 140 , the southbound direction of US 15 has a welcome center , the Mason and Dixon Discovery Center . US 15 's last intersection in Maryland is with the northern end of US 15 Business ( Seton Avenue ) and Welty Road , which leads to Old Gettysburg Road . North of the intersection , US 15 becomes a freeway that continues across the Pennsylvania state line as the U.S. highway 's bypass of Gettysburg . 
 = = History = = 
 When the U.S. Highway System was laid out in 1926 , US 15 did not enter Maryland . US 240 followed US 15 's current corridor from Frederick north to near Harrisburg . No U.S. Highway connected Frederick and Leesburg via Point of Rocks . By the end of 1927 , US 240 was reduced to a Washington – Frederick highway and US 15 connected Point of Rocks and Emmitsburg via Frederick as it does today . 
 = = = Original construction and early improvements = = = 
 US 15 was established partially along what had been a pair of turnpikes . The Frederick and Emmitsburg Turnpike connected Emmitsburg with Harmony Grove which was located at the northern end of Market Street at MD 26 on the north side of Frederick . The Frederick and Buckeystown Turnpike ran from its co @-@ terminus with the Frederick and Monocacy Turnpike at Evergreen Point at what is today the junction of MD 85 and MD 355 , south to 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) south of Buckeystown . When the Maryland State Roads Commission ( MDSRC ) designated highways to be improved as part of a state road system in 1909 , the Frederick – Emmitsburg highway was included in the new system . MDSRC originally planned to build the state road north from the city of Frederick along the Frederick and <unk> Turnpike , then turn east along Hayward Road to meet the Frederick and Emmitsburg Turnpike at Harmony Grove . 
 MDSRC purchased the Frederick and Emmitsburg Turnpike from its operating company in 1911 . The first section of the turnpike to be rebuilt as a modern road was between Tuscarora Creek north of Frederick and just north of Sundays Lane near <unk> in 1911 . The old turnpike was resurfaced as a 14 @-@ foot @-@ wide ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) macadam road from Lewistown to Thurmont in 1914 and from Harmony Grove to Lewistown in 1915 . The Gettysburg Road from Emmitsburg to the Pennsylvania state line was also paved in 1915 . The gaps between Thurmont and Emmitsburg and between the city of Frederick and Harmony Grove were resurfaced between 1915 and 1919 ; the Frederick – Harmony Grove road followed the turnpike right @-@ of @-@ way north from <unk> 's Mill rather than the 1910 planned route via <unk> Pike . 
 The right @-@ of @-@ way of the Frederick and Buckeystown Turnpike was resurfaced with macadam by 1921 . The remainder of Buckeystown Pike was paved as a 15 @-@ foot @-@ wide ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) concrete road from south of Buckeystown to around Lily Pons Road in 1918 and 1919 and south of Lily Pons Road to just north of the modern MD 28 junction in Tuscarora by 1921 . The concrete highway was extended south through the MD 28 junction to modern MD 28 's junction with <unk> Ferry Road by 1923 . That same year , Emmitsburg Pike was paved through Thurmont . In 1926 , MDSRC assumed maintenance of and resurfaced Market Street with asphalt from the city of Frederick between the south city limit at New Design Road ( now Stadium Drive ) to the north city limit at 9th Street . The commission also replaced Buckeystown Pike 's covered bridge at Ballenger Creek with the modern concrete arch bridge that year . US 15 was widened to a width of 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) from Frederick to the Pennsylvania state line around 1930 . The highway from Tuscarora to Point of Rocks was constructed as a concrete road in three stages starting in 1929 , when the paved highway was extended west from <unk> Ferry Road to west of New Design Road . The second section of the new highway was started in 1930 . The third segment was finished in 1933 , which completed the paving of US 15 in Maryland . Around 1938 , the U.S. Highway was resurfaced with asphalt from Emmitsburg to the Pennsylvania state line and from the south end of Frederick to Evergreen Point ; in addition , a grade separation was constructed with the Western Maryland Railway in Thurmont .

This wooden bridge was constructed to carry a double @-@ track narrow gauge railroad from a junction with the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad to a blast furnace to process the area 's iron ore . This bridge , which also carried wagons and horses , was destroyed on June 9 , 1861 by Confederate forces under General Turner Ashby , the same day the bridge at Brunswick was destroyed . The second bridge at Point of Rocks was an iron bridge constructed in 1889 . US 15 originally followed Commerce Street and Canal Road , which is now used to access the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park , through an at @-@ grade crossing of the B & O Railroad to the Maryland end of the bridge , which crossed the river immediately to the east of the modern bridge . The 1889 iron bridge was swept away in the March 1936 flood that also destroyed the Potomac River crossings at Harpers Ferry , Shepherdstown , and Hancock . 
 In November 1936 , MDSRC put together a plan to replace the Potomac River bridges at Hancock , Shepherdstown , and Point of Rocks . The Point of Rocks Bridge became the first of the three crossings to be started when construction began March 25 , 1937 ; the bridge 's concrete piers were completed and the piers of the old bridge were removed from the river by September of that year . The new bridge and its approaches , which crossed over the B & O Railroad on the Maryland side , opened December 26 , 1937 . The camelback truss bridge spans 1 @,@ 689 feet ( 515 m ) and has a 24 @-@ foot @-@ wide ( 7 @.@ 3 m ) roadway and a pair of 3 @-@ foot @-@ wide ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) sidewalks . US 15 followed a temporary approach to the new bridge along Commerce Street that remained vulnerable to major floods . The U.S. Highway was moved to higher ground on Clay Street when the highway was reconstructed and widened from Point of Rocks to Tuscarora in 1949 . 
 = = = Relocation through Frederick = = = 
 The first relocation of US 15 north of Frederick occurred at Tuscarora Creek between 1950 and 1952 . Construction on Washington National Pike , which is now I @-@ 270 , began in 1950 . The highway 's cloverleaf interchange with US 15 , which would serve as the freeway 's northern terminus for several years , was built in 1952 and 1953 . The adjacent portion of US 15 from Evergreen Point south to Lime Kiln was relocated , reconstructed , and widened in 1951 and 1952 . In 1954 , US 240 was moved to Washington National Pike ; the old alignment became US 240 Alternate and then MD 355 in 1956 . The section of freeway from US 15 to the Frederick Freeway was built between 1954 and 1956 concurrent with the first section of the Frederick Freeway . The original interchange between the Frederick Freeway and Washington National Pike included two ramps between the north – south and east – west portions of the Frederick Freeway . 
 The first section of the Frederick Freeway opened from US 40 ( now MD 144 ) east of Frederick to a temporary half @-@ cloverleaf interchange with Patrick Street in 1956 ; this section featured a cloverleaf interchange with US 340 . The remainder of the Frederick Freeway from Patrick Street to MD 26 was placed under construction in 1956 . The highway was constructed as a two @-@ lane freeway from just south of its interchange with Rosemont Avenue to its northern end near Hayward Road , where the freeway tied into existing US 15 at Harmony Grove . The freeway north of Patrick Street featured interchanges with Rosemont Avenue , Motter Avenue , and a westward extension of MD 26 . When the Frederick Freeway opened in 1959 , US 15 was moved to Washington National Pike north of Buckeystown Pike and north through Frederick along the Frederick Freeway . Market Street north of Evergreen Point through downtown Frederick to US 15 north of the city became a northward extension of MD 355 ; the section of Buckeystown Pike from the freeway to Evergreen Point became a section of MD 806 . 
 In 1960 , US 15 from the MD 26 interchange to Harmony Grove was expanded to a divided highway . The Frederick Freeway gained exit numbers in 1965 , the same year the highway 's interchange with 7th Street was added . The exit numbers ranged from 1 at the freeway 's interchange with MD 144 east of Frederick to 9 at the highway 's interchange with MD 26 ; the 7th Street interchange became exit 7A . The two @-@ lane section of the freeway was expanded to its present four @-@ lane configuration in 1969 , the same year the US 340 freeway was completed between Jefferson and Frederick . US 15 's present alignment from Point of Rocks to US 340 was also under construction by 1969 . When the new highway opened in 1970 , US 15 was moved to the new highway and joined US 340 in a concurrency along Jefferson National Pike from Jefferson to the Frederick Freeway . The old section of US 15 from Point of Rocks to Tuscarora became a westward extension of MD 28 . Buckeystown Pike from MD 28 to Washington National Pike was designated MD 85 , which was extended north to MD 355 the following year . The U.S. Highway 's interchange with Mt . Zion Road opened in 1972 . 
 = = = Bypasses and expansion north of Frederick = = = 
 US 15 was widened from downtown Thurmont north to Owens Creek starting in 1953 . That same year , the highway was relocated as the first carriageway of an ultimate divided highway from Owens Creek to just south of the intersection of US 15 with St. Anthony and Orndorff roads south of Mount St. Mary 's University . In 1956 , construction began on the Thurmont Bypass , which was constructed as the first carriageway of an ultimate divided highway from south of Catoctin Furnace to just south of Owens Creek . The bypass , which included an interchange with MD 77 , was completed in 1958 . The MD 77 interchange originally consisted of one two @-@ way ramp in the northeast quadrant of the junction . The old alignment of US 15 through Catoctin Furnace and Thurmont was designated MD 806 by 1960 . US 15 's interchange with MD 550 was built in 1972 . 
 Several other sections of US 15 were bypassed in the 1960s . The highway bypassed Lewistown in 1962 , leaving behind its old alignment of <unk> Bridge Road and <unk> Road , which became a section of MD 806 . Construction on the U.S. Highway 's bypass of Emmitsburg began in 1963 . The following year , the portion of US 15 from the northern end of the bypass to the Pennsylvania state line opened contemporaneously with US 15 's bypass of Gettysburg . The Emmitsburg bypass was completed in 1965 ; the old road through the town was designated US 15 Business by 1967 . MD 140 's overpass of US 15 was constructed in 1971 ; the old alignment of MD 140 was used for interchange ramps between the two highways . 
 US 15 was expanded to a divided highway north of Frederick between 1972 and 1985 . The U.S. Highway was expanded to four lanes from MD 355 at Harmony Grove to <unk> Road in Lewistown in 1973 . Four @-@ laning of US 15 continued in 1981 when the highway was expanded from the intersection with St. Anthony and Orndorff roads south of Mount St. Mary 's University to just south of the Pennsylvania state line near Emmitsburg . This section of divided highway was extended south through the MD 550 interchange in 1983 . As part of this project , the oblique intersection with MD 806 on the north side of Thurmont was removed . MD 806 was moved onto Albert Staub Road , which was extended north over a new crossing of Owens Creek to its present terminus at Roddy Creek Road , where local traffic could access US 15 at a perpendicular intersection . The two @-@ lane highway between Lewistown and MD 550 was expanded to a four @-@ lane divided highway in 1985 . The MD 77 interchange was completed with the construction of the southbound US 15 ramps in the southwest quadrant of the junction . A third interchange was added on the south side of Thurmont as a connector between US 15 and MD 806 in 1985 as well . US 15 's expansion to a four @-@ lane divided highway north of Frederick was completed in 1989 when the piece of highway at the Pennsylvania state line was expanded to four lanes contemporaneous with the four @-@ laning of the Gettysburg bypass .

 US 15 in Frederick is a subject of the I @-@ 270 / US 15 Multi @-@ Modal Corridor Study , which encompasses the corridor of the two highways from I @-@ 270 's interchange with Shady Grove Road in Montgomery County to north of US 15 's intersection with Biggs Ford Road north of Frederick . The study was started by the Maryland State Highway Administration ( MDSHA ) and Maryland Transportation Authority in the mid @-@ 1990s to examine upgrades to the highway and transit infrastructure within the corridor . As part of another long @-@ term project initiated by the I @-@ 70 Corridor Planning Study , Jefferson National Pike 's interchange with I @-@ 70 , which was constructed with two ramps in 1969 , received two ramps from eastbound I @-@ 70 in 1997 ; that same year , access from northbound US 15 and US 340 to westbound I @-@ 70 was added at the Frederick Freeway interchange . Exit numbers on US 15 's portions of Jefferson National Pike and the Frederick Freeway were changed to their present numbers in 2002 . The interchange between Jefferson National Pike and the Frederick Freeway was transformed from a cloverleaf to a partial cloverleaf interchange in 2004 . Access between US 15 and the northern end of MD 355 , then named <unk> Mill Road , was removed in 2006 , the same year a ramp was added from westbound MD 26 to northbound US 15 . The roundabout at the US 15 – MD 464 intersection in Point of Rocks was built in 2009 . 
 MDSHA replaced Motter Avenue 's bridge over US 15 because the concrete deck of the old bridge was deteriorating and the four @-@ lane width of the bridge was insufficient for the traffic it carried . The new bridge has four through traffic lanes , bike lanes , and continuous left turn lanes . The replacement bridge is long enough to accommodate future widening of US 15 . Construction began in spring 2012 and was completed in the Spring of 2015 . The new bridge was built in two sections : one half of the bridge was constructed immediately to the north of the old bridge , then traffic was moved to the half @-@ bridge and the old bridge removed , and the other half of the new bridge was constructed in place of the removed bridge . 
 In 2011 , MDSHA completed a study to examine constructing an interchange at Monocacy Boulevard on the north side of Frederick to replace the present directional crossover intersection . Design work is underway on a diamond interchange with the municipal highway , which serves as a circumferential arterial in the northeastern part of the city . Monocacy Boulevard will be extended west to north – south Thomas Johnson Drive and meet the eastern end of Christophers Crossing , which is a circumferential boulevard throughout northwestern Frederick . As part of this project , US 15 's intersection with Hayward Road will be removed , resulting in the northern end of US 15 's freeway section being extended from MD 26 to Tuscarora Creek .

 U.S. Route 15 Business ( US 15 Business ) is an unsigned business route of US 15 through Emmitsburg . Known as Seton Avenue , the highway runs 2 @.@ 34 miles ( 3 @.@ 77 km ) between junctions with US 15 on the south and north sides of the town . US 15 Business follows the original alignment of US 15 through Emmitsburg . The highway serves the St. Joseph 's College and Mother Seton Shrine campuses , which are home to several emergency management institutions and a shrine dedicated to Elizabeth Ann Seton , the first person born in the United States to be canonized by the Roman Catholic Church . The U.S. Highway 's bypass of the town was constructed between 1963 and 1965 . US 15 Business was assigned to the old alignment of US 15 from south of Emmitsburg to the Pennsylvania state line by 1967 . The business route became unsigned by 1989 and was truncated at its present northern end by 1999 . 
 US 15 Business begins at a superstreet intersection with US 15 ( Catoctin Mountain Highway ) opposite county @-@ maintained Old Frederick Road . Access to northbound US 15 requires following southbound US 15 to a median U @-@ turn . The superstreet intersection replaced a standard highway junction in 2004 . US 15 Business heads north as a two @-@ lane road that immediately intersects the old alignment of US 15 , Old Emmitsburg Road , and crosses Toms Creek . The business route passes the campuses of St. Joseph 's College and the Mother Seton Shrine . St. Joseph 's College is a defunct liberal arts college for women whose operations were absorbed by Mount St. Mary 's University . The campus is now the National Emergency Training Center , a Federal Emergency Management Agency facility that is home of the National Fire Academy , United States Fire Administration , Emergency Management Institute , and the National Fallen Firefighters Memorial . The Seton Shrine comprises the Basilica of the National Shrine of St. Elizabeth Ann Seton and St. Joseph 's Provincial House of the Daughters of Charity of Saint Vincent de Paul . 
 US 15 Business continues north into the Emmitsburg Historic District , where the highway intersects MD 140 ( Main Street ) and passes St. Euphemia 's School and Sisters ' House . The business route veers northeast and crosses Flat Run before approaching its northern terminus at US 15 . Traffic from northbound US 15 Business to northbound US 15 is required to follow the ramp to southbound US 15 and turn around at US 15 's interchange with MD 140 . US 15 Business continues north to MD 873 , an unnamed service road that parallels the southbound direction of US 15 toward the Pennsylvania state line . That intersection is connected to a one @-@ way southbound ramp from US 15 's intersection with Welty Road . The intersection was changed to remove access from northbound US 15 Business to northbound US 15 in 2007 . East of US 15 , Welty Road immediately intersects Old Gettysburg Road , the old alignment of US 15 north towards Gettysburg .
