 Along with his scientific fame , Newton 's studies of the Bible and of the early Church Fathers were also noteworthy . Newton wrote works on textual criticism , most notably An Historical Account of Two Notable Corruptions of Scripture . He placed the crucifixion of Jesus Christ at 3 April , AD 33 , which agrees with one traditionally accepted date . 
 He believed in a rationally immanent world , but he rejected the <unk> implicit in Leibniz and Baruch Spinoza . The ordered and dynamically informed Universe could be understood , and must be understood , by an active reason . In his correspondence , Newton claimed that in writing the Principia " I had an eye upon such Principles as might work with considering men for the belief of a Deity " . He saw evidence of design in the system of the world : " Such a wonderful uniformity in the planetary system must be allowed the effect of choice " . But Newton insisted that divine intervention would eventually be required to reform the system , due to the slow growth of instabilities . For this , Leibniz lampooned him : " God Almighty wants to wind up his watch from time to time : otherwise it would cease to move . He had not , it seems , sufficient foresight to make it a perpetual motion . " 
 Newton 's position was vigorously defended by his follower Samuel Clarke in a famous correspondence . A century later , Pierre @-@ Simon Laplace 's work " Celestial Mechanics " had a natural explanation for why the planet orbits don 't require periodic divine intervention .

 Newton and Robert Boyle 's approach to the mechanical philosophy was promoted by rationalist pamphleteers as a viable alternative to the <unk> and enthusiasts , and was accepted hesitantly by orthodox preachers as well as dissident preachers like the <unk> . The clarity and simplicity of science was seen as a way to combat the emotional and metaphysical superlatives of both superstitious enthusiasm and the threat of atheism , and at the same time , the second wave of English deists used Newton 's discoveries to demonstrate the possibility of a " Natural Religion " . 
 The attacks made against pre @-@ Enlightenment " magical thinking " , and the mystical elements of Christianity , were given their foundation with Boyle 's mechanical conception of the Universe . Newton gave Boyle 's ideas their completion through mathematical proofs and , perhaps more importantly , was very successful in popularising them . 
 Newton saw God as the master creator whose existence could not be denied in the face of the grandeur of all creation .

 In a manuscript he wrote in 1704 in which he describes his attempts to extract scientific information from the Bible , he estimated that the world would end no earlier than 2060 . In predicting this he said , " This I mention not to assert when the time of the end shall be , but to put a stop to the rash conjectures of fanciful men who are frequently predicting the time of the end , and by doing so bring the sacred prophesies into discredit as often as their predictions fail . " 
 = = = Alchemy = = = 
 In the character of Morton <unk> in " Poor Superman " ( 1951 ) , speculative fiction author Fritz Leiber says of Newton , " Everyone knows Newton as the great scientist . Few remember that he spent half his life muddling with alchemy , looking for the philosopher 's stone . That was the pebble by the seashore he really wanted to find . " 
 Of an estimated ten million words of writing in Newton 's papers , about one million deal with alchemy . Many of Newton 's writings on alchemy are copies of other manuscripts , with his own annotations . Alchemical texts mix artisanal knowledge with philosophical speculation , often hidden behind layers of wordplay , allegory , and imagery to protect craft secrets . Some of the content contained in Newton 's papers could have been considered heretical by the church . 
 In 1888 , after spending sixteen years cataloging Newton 's papers , Cambridge University kept a small number and returned the rest to the Earl of Portsmouth . In 1936 , a descendant offered the papers for sale at Sotheby ’ s . The collection was broken up and sold for a total of about £ 9 @,@ 000 . John Maynard Keynes was one of about three dozen bidders who obtained part of the collection at auction . Keynes went on to reassemble an estimated half of Newton 's collection of papers on alchemy before donating his collection to Cambridge University in 1946 . 
 All of Newton 's known writings on alchemy are currently being put online in a project undertaken by Indiana University : " The <unk> of Isaac Newton " . The project is headed by William R. Newman . Here is a quote from the project web site . 
 Newton 's fundamental contributions to science include the quantification of gravitational attraction , the discovery that white light is actually a mixture of immutable spectral colors , and the formulation of the calculus . Yet there is another , more mysterious side to Newton that is imperfectly known , a realm of activity that spanned some thirty years of his life , although he kept it largely hidden from his contemporaries and colleagues . We refer to Newton 's involvement in the discipline of alchemy , or as it was often called in seventeenth @-@ century England , " <unk> . " 
 = = Enlightenment philosophers = = 
 Enlightenment philosophers chose a short history of scientific predecessors – Galileo , Boyle , and Newton principally – as the guides and guarantors of their applications of the singular concept of Nature and Natural law to every physical and social field of the day . In this respect , the lessons of history and the social structures built upon it could be discarded . 
 It was Newton 's conception of the Universe based upon Natural and rationally understandable laws that became one of the seeds for Enlightenment ideology . Locke and Voltaire applied concepts of Natural Law to political systems advocating intrinsic rights ; the physiocrats and Adam Smith applied Natural conceptions of psychology and self @-@ interest to economic systems ; and sociologists criticised the current social order for trying to fit history into Natural models of progress . <unk> and Samuel Clarke resisted elements of Newton 's work , but eventually rationalised it to conform with their strong religious views of nature . 
 = = Apple incident = = 
 Newton himself often told the story that he was inspired to formulate his theory of gravitation by watching the fall of an apple from a tree . Although it has been said that the apple story is a myth and that he did not arrive at his theory of gravity in any single moment , acquaintances of Newton ( such as William Stukeley , whose manuscript account of 1752 has been made available by the Royal Society ) do in fact confirm the incident , though not the cartoon version that the apple actually hit Newton 's head . Stukeley recorded in his Memoirs of Sir Isaac Newton 's Life a conversation with Newton in Kensington on 15 April 1726 : 
 we went into the garden , & drank thea under the shade of some <unk> ; only he , & my <unk> amidst other discourse , he told me , he was just in the same situation , as when formerly , the notion of gravitation came into his mind . " why should that apple always descend perpendicularly to the ground , " thought he to himself ; occasion 'd by the fall of an apple , as he sat in a contemplative mood . " why should it not go sideways , or upwards ? but constantly to the earths center ? assuredly , the reason is , that the earth draws it. there must be a drawing power in matter . & the sum of the drawing power in the matter of the earth must be in the earths center , not in any side of the <unk> therefore dos this apple fall perpendicularly , or toward the <unk> if matter thus draws matter ; it must be in proportion of its <unk> therefore the apple draws the earth , as well as the earth draws the apple . 
 John Conduitt , Newton 's assistant at the Royal Mint and husband of Newton 's niece , also described the event when he wrote about Newton 's life : 
 In the year 1666 he retired again from Cambridge to his mother in Lincolnshire . Whilst he was pensively meandering in a garden it came into his thought that the power of gravity ( which brought an apple from a tree to the ground ) was not limited to a certain distance from earth , but that this power must extend much further than was usually thought . Why not as high as the Moon said he to himself & if so , that must influence her motion & perhaps retain her in her orbit , whereupon he fell a calculating what would be the effect of that supposition . 
 In similar terms , Voltaire wrote in his Essay on Epic Poetry ( 1727 ) , " Sir Isaac Newton walking in his gardens , had the first thought of his system of gravitation , upon seeing an apple falling from a tree . " 
 It is known from his notebooks that Newton was grappling in the late 1660s with the idea that terrestrial gravity extends , in an inverse @-@ square proportion , to the Moon ; however it took him two decades to develop the full @-@ fledged theory . The question was not whether gravity existed , but whether it extended so far from Earth that it could also be the force holding the Moon to its orbit . Newton showed that if the force decreased as the inverse square of the distance , one could indeed calculate the Moon 's orbital period , and get good agreement . He guessed the same force was responsible for other orbital motions , and hence named it " universal gravitation " . 
 Various trees are claimed to be " the " apple tree which Newton describes . The King 's School , Grantham , claims that the tree was purchased by the school , uprooted and transported to the headmaster 's garden some years later . The staff of the [ now ] National Trust @-@ owned Woolsthorpe Manor dispute this , and claim that a tree present in their gardens is the one described by Newton . A descendant of the original tree can be seen growing outside the main gate of Trinity College , Cambridge , below the room Newton lived in when he studied there . The National Fruit Collection at Brogdale can supply grafts from their tree , which appears identical to Flower of Kent , a coarse @-@ fleshed cooking variety .

 = HMS Furious ( 47 ) = 
 HMS Furious was a modified Courageous @-@ class battlecruiser built for the Royal Navy ( RN ) during the First World War . Designed to support the Baltic Project championed by the First Sea Lord of the Admiralty , Lord John Fisher , the ship was very lightly armoured and designed to be armed with only two heavy guns ( 18 @-@ inch ) , one forward and one aft , plus a number of lesser guns . Furious was modified and became an aircraft carrier while under construction . Her forward turret was removed and a flight deck was added in its place , so that aircraft had to manoeuvre around the superstructure to land . Later in the war , the ship had her rear turret removed and a second flight deck installed aft of the superstructure , but this was less than satisfactory due to air turbulence . Furious was briefly laid up after the war before she was reconstructed with a full @-@ length flight deck in the early 1920s . 
 After her conversion , Furious was used extensively for trials of naval aircraft and later as a training carrier once the new armoured carriers like Ark Royal entered service in the late 1930s . During the early months of the Second World War the carrier spent her time hunting for German raiders in the North Atlantic and escorting convoys . This changed dramatically during the Norwegian Campaign in early 1940 when her aircraft provided air support to British troops ashore in addition to attacking German shipping . The first of what would be a large number of aircraft ferry missions was made by the carrier during the campaign . After the withdrawal of British troops in May , Furious made several anti @-@ shipping strikes in Norway with little result before beginning a steady routine of ferrying aircraft for the Royal Air Force . 
 At first Furious made several trips to West Africa , but she began to ferry aircraft to Gibraltar in 1941 . An unsuccessful attack on German @-@ occupied ports on the Arctic Ocean interrupted the ferry missions in mid @-@ 1941 . Furious was given a lengthy refit in the United States and spent a few months training after her return in April 1942 . She made several more ferry trips in mid @-@ 1942 before her aircraft attacked airfields in Vichy French Algeria as part of the opening stages of Operation Torch in November 1942 . The ship remained in the Mediterranean until February 1943 when she was transferred to the Home Fleet . 
 Furious spent most of 1943 training , but made a number of attacks on the German battleship Tirpitz and other targets in Norway during the first half of 1944 . By September 1944 , the ship was showing her age and she was placed in reserve . Furious was decommissioned in April 1945 , but was not sold for scrap until 1948 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 During the First World War , Admiral Fisher was prevented from ordering an improved version of the preceding Renown @-@ class battlecruisers by a wartime restriction that banned construction of ships larger than light cruisers . To obtain ships suitable for traditional battlecruiser roles , such as scouting for fleets and hunting enemy raiders , he settled on ships with the minimal armour of a light cruiser and the armament of a battlecruiser . He justified their existence by claiming he needed fast , shallow @-@ draught ships for his Baltic Project , a plan to invade Germany via its Baltic coast . 
 Furious had an overall length of 786 feet 9 inches ( 239 @.@ 8 m ) , a beam of 88 feet ( 26 @.@ 8 m ) , and a draught of 24 feet 11 inches ( 7 @.@ 6 m ) at deep load . She displaced 19 @,@ 513 long tons ( 19 @,@ 826 t ) normally and 22 @,@ 890 long tons ( 23 @,@ 257 t ) at deep load . She had a metacentric height of 5 @.@ 33 feet ( 1 @.@ 6 m ) at deep load . Furious and her half @-@ sisters were the first large warships in the Royal Navy to have geared steam turbines . To save design time the installation used in the light cruiser Champion , the first cruiser in the RN with geared turbines , was copied and simply duplicated to provide two sets of turbines . The four Brown @-@ Curtis turbines were powered by eighteen Yarrow small @-@ tube boilers that were designed to produce a total of 90 @,@ 000 shaft horsepower ( 67 @,@ 000 kW ) . The ship 's speed was an estimated 31 @.@ 5 knots ( 58 @.@ 3 km / h ; 36 @.@ 2 mph ) , but she never ran her sea trials . 
 Furious was designed to normally carry 750 long tons ( 762 t ) of fuel oil , but could carry a maximum of 3 @,@ 160 long tons ( 3 @,@ 211 t ) . At full capacity , she could steam for an estimated 6 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 11 @,@ 110 km ; 6 @,@ 900 mi ) at a speed of 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) . The ship was designed to carry two BL 18 @-@ inch Mark I guns in two single turrets , one each fore ( ' A ' ) and aft ( ' Y ' ) . Her secondary armament consisted of 11 BL 5 @.@ 5 @-@ inch Mk I guns . A pair of QF 3 inch 20 cwt anti @-@ aircraft guns were mounted before the funnel . Furious also mounted two submerged tubes for 21 @-@ inch torpedoes and 10 torpedoes were carried . 
 Even as she was being built , Furious was modified with a large hangar capable of housing ten aircraft on her forecastle that replaced the forward turret . A 160 @-@ foot ( 49 m ) flight deck was built along its roof . Aircraft were flown off and , rather less successfully , landed on this deck . Floatplanes like the Short Type 184 used a four @-@ wheel trolley that ran down a track along the centre of the flight deck for take @-@ off . Aircraft were lifted by crane from the hangar to the flight deck . Although the aft turret was fitted and the gun tested , it was not long before Furious returned to her builders for further modifications . In November 1917 , the rear turret was replaced by a 300 @-@ foot ( 91 m ) deck for landing aircraft over another hangar . Her funnel and superstructure remained intact , with a narrow strip of decking around them to connect the fore and aft flight decks . Turbulence from the funnel and superstructure was severe enough that only three landing attempts were successful before further attempts were forbidden . Her 18 @-@ inch guns were reused on Lord Clive @-@ class monitors General Wolfe and Lord Clive during the war . 
 Furious was laid down on 8 June 1915 at Armstrong Whitworth 's Low Walker shipyard in Newcastle upon Tyne . The ship was launched on 18 August 1916 and commissioned on 26 June 1917 . As completed , her complement numbered 737 officers and enlisted men . 
 = = Aircraft landing and the First World War = = 
 On 2 August 1917 , while performing trials , Squadron Commander Edwin Dunning landed a Sopwith Pup , believed to have been <unk> , successfully on board Furious , becoming the first person to land an aircraft on a moving ship . On 7 August , he made one more successful landing in the same manner , but on his third attempt , in Pup <unk> , the engine choked and the aircraft crashed off the starboard bow , killing him . The deck arrangement was unsatisfactory because aircraft had to manoeuvre around the superstructure in order to land . 
 In the meantime , all three Courageous @-@ class ships were assigned to the 1st Cruiser Squadron ( CS ) in October 1917 when the Admiralty received word of German ship movements on 16 October , possibly indicating a raid . Admiral Beatty , commander of the Grand Fleet , ordered most of his light cruisers and destroyers to sea in an effort to locate the enemy ships . Furious was detached from the 1st CS and ordered to sweep along the 56th parallel as far as 4 ° East and to return before dark . Her half @-@ sisters Courageous and Glorious were not initially ordered to sea , but were sent to reinforce the 2nd Light Cruiser Squadron patrolling the central part of the North Sea later that day . Two German Brummer @-@ class light cruisers managed to slip through the gaps in the British patrols and destroyed the Scandinavia convoy during the morning of 17 October , but no word was received of the engagement until that afternoon . The 1st CS was ordered to attempt to intercept the German ships , but they proved to be faster than hoped and the British ships were unsuccessful . 
 Furious returned to the dockyard in November to have the aft turret removed and replaced by another deck for landing , giving her both a launching and a recovery deck . Two lifts ( elevators ) serving the hangars were also installed . Furious was recommissioned on 15 March 1918 , and her embarked aircraft were used on anti @-@ Zeppelin patrols in the North Sea after May . In July 1918 , she flew off seven Sopwith Camels which participated in the Tondern raid , attacking the Zeppelin sheds there with moderate success . 
 = = Conversion = = 
 = = = Overview = = = 
 Furious was laid up after the war , but was converted to an aircraft carrier with a continuous flight deck between June 1921 and September 1925 . Her design was based on experience gained with the first two British carriers , Argus and Eagle , although this was very limited as Argus was less than three years old and Eagle had only carried out 143 deck landings during her preliminary sea trials in 1920 . 
 The ship 's superstructure , masts , funnel and landing deck were removed and she was given a 576 @-@ by @-@ 92 @-@ foot ( 175 @.@ 6 by 28 @.@ 0 m ) flight deck that extended over three @-@ quarters of her length . This flight deck was not level ; it sloped upwards about three @-@ quarters of the way from the stern to help slow down landing aircraft , which had no brakes at that time . The fore @-@ and @-@ aft 320 @-@ foot ( 97 @.@ 5 m ) arresting gear was not intended to stop landing aircraft — the landing speeds of the time were low enough that this was unnecessary given a good headwind — but rather to prevent aircraft from veering off to one side and potentially falling off the flight deck . Various designs for the flight deck were tested in a wind tunnel by the National Physical Laboratory which showed that the distinctive elliptical shape and rounded edges used minimised turbulence . 
 Furious was not lengthened , but her beam was increased 1 foot ( 0 @.@ 3 m ) to 89 feet .75 inches ( 27 @.@ 1 m ) and her average draught was now 27 feet 3 inches ( 8 @.@ 3 m ) at deep load , 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 6 m ) deeper than before the conversion . She displaced 22 @,@ 500 long tons ( 22 @,@ 900 t ) at normal load and 26 @,@ 500 long tons ( 26 @,@ 900 t ) at deep load , over 3000 long tons more than her previous displacement . Her metacentric height was 3 @.@ 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 1 m ) at deep load , a reduction of 1 @.@ 48 feet ( 0 @.@ 5 m ) after her conversion . During the ship 's post @-@ conversion sea trials she reached 30 @.@ 03 knots ( 55 @.@ 62 km / h ; 34 @.@ 56 mph ) . Her fuel capacity was increased by 700 long tons ( 710 t ) during her reconstruction , which increased her range to 5 @,@ 300 nautical miles ( 9 @,@ 800 km ; 6 @,@ 100 mi ) at a speed of 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) or 7 @,@ 480 nautical miles ( 13 @,@ 850 km ; 8 @,@ 610 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . 
 A two @-@ level hangar was built under the flight deck , 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) in height per level . The lower hangar was 550 feet ( 167 @.@ 6 m ) long by 35 – 50 feet ( 10 @.@ 7 – 15 @.@ 2 m ) wide and the upper was 520 by 50 feet ( 158 @.@ 5 by 15 @.@ 2 m ) . Each hangar could be sectioned off by electrically operated steel shutters on rollers . Her boilers were ducted down the side of the ship to exhaust either out of gratings at the rear of the flight deck or , when landing operations were in progress , out of the side of the lower hangar at the rear of the ship . This solution proved to be very unsatisfactory as it consumed valuable space , made parts of the lower hangar unbearable and interfered with landing operations to a greater or lesser degree . Her original flying @-@ off deck remained in place for use by small aircraft like fighters which improved launch and recovery cycle flexibility allowing the ship to simultaneously land aircraft on the main flight deck while fighters were taking off on the lower deck or to speedily fly off her aircraft from both decks . Doors at the forward end of the upper hangar opened onto the lower flying deck . Like Argus , Furious was flush @-@ decked and lacked an island superstructure to minimise any turbulence over the flight deck ; instead she had a navigating position at the leading edge of the flight deck , starboard , and was provided with a retractable <unk> forward , on the flight deck centreline . The ship could normally only carry about 36 aircraft . 
 Two 47 @-@ by @-@ 46 @-@ foot ( 14 @.@ 3 by 14 @.@ 0 m ) lifts ( elevators ) were installed to transfer aircraft between the flight deck and hangars . No arresting gear was fitted and two 600 @-@ imperial @-@ gallon ( 2 @,@ 700 l ; 720 US gal ) ready @-@ use petrol tanks were provided for aircraft and the ship 's boats on the upper deck . An additional 20 @,@ 000 imperial gallons ( 91 @,@ 000 l ; 24 @,@ 000 US gal ) of petrol were in bulk storage . In 1939 , her complement consisted of 41 officers and 754 crewmen . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Furious retained ten of her original eleven breech @-@ loading 5 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 140 mm ) guns , five on each side , for self @-@ defence from enemy warships . Six QF 4 @-@ inch Mark V guns replaced her original anti @-@ aircraft guns . Four were mounted on the sides of the flying @-@ off deck and two on the quarterdeck . The four guns on the flying @-@ off deck were removed in 1926 – 27 for trials of the lower flight deck , but only two were replaced when the trials were concluded . Four single QF 2 @-@ pounder " pom @-@ poms " were installed in 1927 . During Furious 's September 1930 – February 1932 refit , her anti @-@ aircraft outfit was reinforced by the addition of two eight @-@ barrel QF 2 @-@ pounder Mark V pom @-@ pom mounts where the forward 4 @-@ inch guns on the flying @-@ off deck had been removed earlier . 
 The 5 @.@ 5 @-@ inch and 4 @-@ inch guns were replaced during her refit in early 1939 by a dozen QF 4 @-@ inch Mk XVI guns in twin dual @-@ purpose Mark XIX mounts . One mount each was on the former flying @-@ off deck and the quarterdeck while the other four were mounted two per side . Two more Mark V 2 @-@ pounder mounts were added fore and aft of the newly added island superstructure at the same time . While later refitting in the United States , the ship was fitted with a maximum of 22 manually operated automatic 20 @-@ millimetre ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) Oerlikon light anti @-@ aircraft guns , which replaced the single quadruple Vickers .50 machine gun mount . 
 A single High Angle Control System director was fitted on the island and another on an elevated mount on the former flying @-@ off deck . Two pom @-@ pom directors were also mounted on the island for the weapons mounted fore and aft of the island .

 Furious was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet after commissioning in 1925 although she spent much of the next several years conducting trials for practically every aircraft in the Fleet Air Arm ( FAA ) inventory . These included landing and flying @-@ off tests of Fairey IIID and Fairey Flycatcher floatplanes , with and without wheels , to compare various designs of wooden and metal floats . The lower flight deck was greased to allow them to take off with a minimum of difficulty . A Flycatcher fitted with wooden skids was also tested and behaved perfectly satisfactorily . The arresting gear was barely used during these trials and it was removed shortly afterwards . Deck @-@ edge palisades were installed in 1927 to keep aircraft from blowing over the side in rough weather . The first carrier night @-@ landing was made by a Blackburn Dart on 6 May 1926 aboard Furious . In the 1920s , the ship commonly carried one flight of fighters ( Fairey Flycatcher ) , two of spotters ( Blackburn Blackburn or Avro Bison ) , one spotter reconnaissance ( Fairey IIID ) and two flights of torpedo bombers ( Blackburn Dart ) , each usually of six aircraft . 
 Furious was reduced to reserve on 1 July 1930 in preparation for a lengthy overhaul at Devonport . It lasted from September 1930 to February 1932 and was focused on refitting her machinery and re @-@ tubing her boilers . In addition her quarterdeck was raised by one deck , the AA armament was revised and spraying facilities were fitted in the hangars . Upon completion , she ran a full @-@ power trial on 16 February 1932 where her maximum speed was 28 @.@ 8 knots ( 53 @.@ 3 km / h ; 33 @.@ 1 mph ) from a total of 89 @,@ 745 shaft horsepower ( 66 @,@ 923 kW ) . 
 Furious recommissioned in May 1932 as part of the Home Fleet with a reduced crew before being brought up to full complement in November . Transverse arresting gear was fitted sometime during the mid @-@ 1930s . She was detached to the Mediterranean Fleet from May to October 1934 . Furious was present at the Coronation Fleet Review at Spithead on 20 May 1937 for George VI . She became a deck @-@ landing training carrier in 1937 , although she was refitted in Devonport between December 1937 and May 1938 where the forward end of her lower flight deck was raised to make her less wet forward . During the Munich Crisis in September 1938 , the ship embarked 801 , 821 and 822 Squadrons and joined the fleet at Scapa Flow , before resuming her training duties after the peaceful conclusion of the affair . She was struck a glancing blow by the destroyer Encounter during this time , but suffered only minor damage . 
 From 1933 to the end of 1938 Furious carried 801 Squadron which initially flew a mixture of six Hawker Nimrod and three Flycatcher fighters . Hawker Osprey fighters replaced the Flycatchers in early 1934 and the Nimrods were withdrawn in October 1936 . 811 and 822 Squadrons were embarked for reconnaissance and anti @-@ shipping missions . They flew the Blackburn Ripon , the Blackburn Baffin and the Fairey Swordfish torpedo bombers and as well as the Fairey IIIF , the Fairey Seal and the Blackburn Shark reconnaissance aircraft . 
 The ship was given a more extensive refit from January to May 1939 that removed her 5 @.@ 5 @-@ inch guns and palisades , mounted anti @-@ aircraft guns on her lower flying @-@ off deck , plated in the doors at the forward end of the upper hangar , and gave her a small island on the starboard side . Furious resumed her training duties after the completion of the refit and continued them until October 1939 . As a deck @-@ landing training carrier in 1939 Furious embarked 767 Squadron , flying Shark , Swordfish and Fairey Albacore torpedo bombers and reconnaissance aircraft , and 769 Squadron , flying Blackburn Skua , Blackburn Roc , and Gloster Sea Gladiator fighters .

 Furious remained on training duties , combined with anti @-@ submarine sweeps off the east coast of Scotland until 2 October 1939 . She was then assigned to the Home Fleet to replace the sunken Courageous and embarked nine Swordfish aircraft from 816 Squadron and a detachment of three more Swordfish from 818 Squadron . The ship sortied on 8 October with the fleet to unsuccessfully hunt for the German battleship Gneisenau and escorting ships which had been spotted off southern Norway . After returning from this search , Furious departed her berth adjacent to the battleship Royal Oak in Scapa Flow for more futile searches for German ships on 13 October , the day before Royal Oak was sunk by U @-@ 47 . Afterwards she was transferred to Halifax , Nova Scotia , where she and the battlecruiser HMS Repulse formed a hunting group for German raiders . Furious served as the flagship for the convoy bringing most of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division to Britain in mid @-@ December 1939 . In the darkness on 17 December , the west @-@ bound ocean liner SS Samaria passed through the convoy unseen . She ripped off the horizontal wireless masts on Furious 's starboard side , carried away five overhanging lifeboats from the port side of RMS Aquitania , and just missed the third and fourth ships in line . 
 = = = Norwegian Campaign = = = 
 Furious joined the Home Fleet off the coast of Norway on 10 April 1940 with only eighteen Swordfish from 816 and 818 Squadrons embarked ; no fighters were able to join the ship in time . Sixteen Swordfish made unsuccessful torpedo attacks on German ships in Trondheim harbour the following morning . On 12 April , both squadrons attempted to attack German ships in Narvik in bad weather . Disappointed with the failure of the torpedo attacks the previous day , bombs were carried instead . 818 Squadron , making the first attack , damaged several captured Norwegian ships , but lost two aircraft to flak , although the crews were rescued by the British cruiser Penelope and the destroyer Punjabi . Following 40 minutes behind , 816 Squadron was forced to turn back by heavy weather . One aircraft was lost while landing , but the crew was recovered . Another attack was launched the next day in support of the British ships entering Narvik , but they contributed little and another pair of Swordfish were shot down . 
 Furious , ordered to remain behind after the bulk of the Home Fleet departed on 15 April , departed the Narvik area on 14 April , escorted by three destroyers , to refuel at Tromsø . En route , her Swordfish attacked Junkers Ju 52 transports that had landed on frozen Lake <unk> approximately 10 miles ( 16 @.@ 1 km ) north @-@ east of Narvik . Two of the Ju 52s were destroyed and several others damaged . She reached the port on 16 April with only 27 % of her fuel remaining . She stayed there until 18 April when she headed south to scout the Narvik area . She was attacked en route by a single Heinkel He 111 bomber of the II . / KG 26 wing from very high altitude . Two large bombs narrowly missed the ship , the closest only 11 yards ( 10 @.@ 1 m ) off the port side aft . The shock shook her propeller shafts out of alignment and jarred the port inner high @-@ pressure turbine so that she was limited to 20 knots ( 37 km / h ; 23 mph ) . Furious remained off the coast of Norway despite the damage and attempted to fly off aircraft on 22 April , despite severe weather , to discourage German aircraft from delivering supplies to the German forces in Narvik . One aircraft was shot down by the Germans and the others returned reporting heavy snowstorms between the ship and Narvik . The weather worsened the next day and Captain Troubridge decided to head to Harstad to check the damage from the near miss . It proved worse than anticipated and he was ordered back to the United Kingdom . Only six of the nine remaining Swordfish were serviceable . 
 After quick repairs , which included the removal of several rows of turbine blades , Furious returned to Norway on 18 May carrying the Gladiators of a reformed Royal Air Force 263 Squadron ; they were flown off on 21 April once their base at Bardufoss was ready . One Gladiator and the guiding Swordfish crashed en route , killing all crewmen . The ship returned to Scapa Flow once all the Gladiators had been flown off , carrying only six Sea Gladiators of 804 Squadron and nine Swordfish of 816 Squadron for self @-@ protection while ferrying 263 Squadron . 
 On 14 June , carrying only half of 816 Squadron for her own protection , Furious sailed unescorted for Halifax carrying £ 18 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 in gold bullion . On 1 July she escorted a convoy of Canadian troops bound for Iceland from Halifax and ferried over almost 50 aircraft with spare parts and munitions . On his own initiative , Captain Troubridge ordered all available space should be used to transport sugar to Britain . Upon her arrival , she embarked the rest of 816 Squadron , as well as nine Skuas of 801 Squadron and nine Swordfish of 825 , and made a number of largely unsuccessful air strikes on shipping in Norwegian waters and on the seaplane base at Tromsø in September and October 1940 , at a cost of several aircraft . Both Swordfish squadrons disembarked afterwards to make room as she prepared to resume her role as an aircraft transport .

 Furious loaded 55 aircraft , mostly crated Hawker Hurricane fighters of No. 73 Squadron RAF , in Liverpool on 7 November and sailed for Takoradi , Gold Coast on 15 November where they were flown off or off @-@ loaded on 27 November with the ultimate destination of Egypt . During this time she retained only six Skuas of 801 Squadron for her own protection . Furious was back in Liverpool by 15 December where she embarked 40 more Hurricanes for Takoradi . She sailed on 21 December and joined up with Convoy <unk> and the small carrier Argus . The German cruiser Admiral Hipper encountered the convoy on 25 December , but little damage was inflicted by Admiral Hipper before she was driven off by the escorts . No air strike could be flown against the German cruiser because the Swordfish were embarked in Argus with bombs that they could not carry and their torpedoes were aboard Furious . After Furious 's Skuas had flown off to search for Hipper , space was made to land the Swordfish to load the torpedoes , but the Skuas could not locate Admiral Hipper because of the poor visibility . Furious reached Takoradi on 10 January 1941 and arrived back in Britain on 5 February where she was given a brief refit . She made another ferry trip to Takoradi on 4 March , carrying 12 Fairey Fulmars of 807 Squadron and six Swordfish of 825 Squadron for self @-@ defence . 
 Furious now had a new destination for her ferry trips and she transported 24 Hurricanes to Gibraltar on 25 April where they were transferred to Ark Royal to be flown off for Malta . She sailed for a brief refit at Belfast immediately afterwards . While in Belfast she was hit by one small bomb and near @-@ missed by two others during a German air raid in early May , but was only lightly damaged . The ship loaded another batch of 40 Hurricane IIs , plus nine Fulmars from ' X ' Flight of 800 Squadron in Liverpool , and arrived back in Gibraltar on 18 May . Some of these fighters were moved to Ark Royal via planks between the flight decks of the carriers berthed stern to stern . This time she accompanied Ark Royal and the two carriers flew off their fighters from a position south of Sardinia . Furious loaded 48 more Hurricane IIs and arrived back in Gibraltar on 1 June where some of the fighters were transferred to Ark Royal . The two carriers departed Gibraltar on 4 June and flew off 44 of the 48 fighters . Furious returned to the Clyde for her biggest load of aircraft yet , 64 Hurricanes , leaving room for only nine Swordfish from 816 Squadron on this voyage . Upon her arrival on 25 June she transferred 22 Hurricanes to Ark Royal and that carrier flew them off to Malta the next day . Of the 42 Hurricanes left on Furious , 26 were moved to Ark Royal when she returned on 28 June . This time , however , both carriers sailed to deliver the fighters to their usual take @-@ off point west of Sicily . The tenth of Furious 's aircraft to take off crashed into her island , killing 14 men and starting a serious fire on the flight deck . The blocked flight deck forced the remaining six Hurricanes to remain on board and they were returned to Gibraltar . Furious exchanged 816 Squadron for 818 from Ark Royal , then departed for home . 
 In July , Furious embarked nine Fulmars of 800 Squadron , ' A ' Flight of 880 Squadron with four Sea Hurricane IBs , nine Swordfish from 812 Squadron and nine Albacores of 817 Squadron to attack the German @-@ occupied ports of Kirkenes , Norway , and Petsamo , Finland , departing Scapa Flow on the 23rd in company with the carrier Victorious , two cruisers and six destroyers . The two carriers and their escorts gathered in Seidisfjord , Iceland , under the command of Rear Admiral Wake @-@ Walker where they refuelled in late July . Furious attacked ships in Petsamo on 30 July with all of her Swordfish and Albacores , escorted by six Fulmars and all four Sea Hurricanes , but there was very little shipping present . One small ship , MV Trotter , was sunk , several oil storage tanks were set afire , and several wooden jetties were torpedoed . The British ships had been spotted before the attack and two Fulmars and an Albacore were shot down by the alerted defences . Furious was short of fuel and had to leave shortly afterwards , but she transferred her Albacores to Victorious to fill up that carrier 's decimated squadrons before she left . Sea Hurricanes of 880 Squadron shot down a shadowing Dornier Do 18 flying boat on 31 July as the ship was leaving . 
 On 30 August , Furious left Belfast with a load of 49 Hurricanes , carrying three Fulmars of 800 Squadron and four Sea Hurricane IBs of <unk> Squadron for self @-@ defence , and nine Swordfish of 812 Squadron for Ark Royal . She arrived in Gibraltar on 6 September and transferred 40 Hurricanes to the other carrier the next day . Ark Royal sailed for the departure point the following day , but could only fly off 14 Hurricanes because some of the Bristol Blenheim bombers used to guide the fighters to Malta failed to make their rendezvous . When Ark Royal returned , she transferred the six Swordfish of 810 Squadron to Furious and both carriers departed that same day to deliver the Hurricanes . This was Furious 's last ferry mission as she was sent to Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , for a lengthy refit . She arrived on 7 October and did not return to the United Kingdom until April 1942 . 
 Furious spent the next three months after her return working up . In August , she was detailed to accompany the convoy bound for Malta in Operation Pedestal , but she was only to sail far enough with them to allow her 38 Supermarine Spitfires to reach Malta . This she did , just as Eagle was torpedoed , but Furious turned around after flying off her fighters and reached Gibraltar successfully . She loaded another batch of 32 Spitfires on 16 August and they were flown off the following day south @-@ east of the Balearic Islands . After this mission , Furious was sent back to the Home Fleet for training . One last mission was necessary to reinforce the defences of Malta before Operation Torch and the ship arrived at Gibraltar on 27 October . She loaded 32 Spitfires and launched them on 29 August before returning to Gibraltar and being assigned to Force H. 
 As part of Operation Torch , Furious embarked 12 Supermarine Seafire IBs of 801 Squadron , another 12 Seafire IICs of 807 Squadron and nine Albacores of 822 Squadron to provide air cover for the amphibious landings by the Central Task Force . On the morning of 8 November , Furious 's Seafires strafed the Vichy French airfield at <unk> , destroying three aircraft on the ground and shooting down one Dewoitine D.520 fighter , the first air @-@ to @-@ air kill by a Seafire . Eight Albacores , escorted by Sea Hurricanes from two escort carriers , attacked the field at La <unk> . They were attacked by D.520s as they began their attack dive , but they destroyed 47 aircraft on the ground despite the loss of an Albacore from anti @-@ aircraft fire and the loss of three and damage to two more against the French fighters . Seafires of 807 Squadron from Furious covered the landings at Oran , engaging a flight of D.520s , shooting down three and destroying about twenty aircraft on the ground .

 Furious remained with Force H until February 1943 before transferring to the Home Fleet where she remained for the rest of the war . In July , the fleet demonstrated off the coast of Norway in strength to distract attention from the Allied invasion of Sicily ; Furious 's role was to allow a German reconnaissance aircraft to spot the British ships and make a report , then shoot it down . She was refitted in August and spent the rest of the year training . During the passage of Convoy JW @-@ 57 from the U.K. to Russia in February 1944 , Furious , escorted by the British battleship Anson and the French battleship Richelieu , attacked German shipping off the Norwegian coast on 24 February . The carrier had the Seafire IBs of 801 Squadron aboard , plus the Fairey Barracuda torpedo bombers of 827 Squadron and 830 Squadrons . No aircraft were lost and a beached freighter was destroyed . 
 In preparation for Operation Tungsten , an attack on the German battleship Tirpitz , Furious and Victorious exchanged Barracuda squadrons , 827 for 831 Squadron , so that the squadrons that trained together could fly together . Furious also embarked 880 Squadron with eight Seafire <unk> fighters to reinforce the six Seafire IBs of 801 Squadron . On the morning of 3 April , 21 Barracudas of 827 and 830 Squadrons made the first attack just as the Tirpitz was getting under way for sea trials . The Germans were caught entirely by surprise and the Tirpitz 's smokescreen was only just beginning to form . The British aircraft enjoyed a clear view of their target and hit the German battleship six times . An hour later the second wave of 19 Barracudas from 829 and 831 Squadrons arrived and scored eight more hits . Only one Barracuda was shot down from each wave and another crashed on take @-@ off . 801 and 880 Squadrons were retained for fleet air defence during the operation . Tirpitz 's superstructure and upper hull was moderately damaged by the bombs , but her machinery was intact because the Barracuda pilots pressed home their attack below the 3 @,@ 000 @-@ foot ( 910 m ) altitude necessary to give their 1 @,@ 600 @-@ pound ( 730 kg ) armour @-@ piercing bombs enough velocity to penetrate Tirpitz 's main armoured deck . Nonetheless Tirpitz was under repair for three months . 
 The Home Fleet tried another attack on Tirpitz later on 23 April , but bad weather prevented any attack from being made that day and for the next several days . Instead , the aircraft attempted to attack installations at Bodø on 26 April , but found a German convoy instead and sank three ships . Furious and the escort carrier Searcher attacked shipping in the vicinity of Kristiansund and sank the ore carrier Almora and the tanker Saarburg for the loss of two aircraft on 6 May . Another attack on Tirpitz by the Home Fleet had to be abandoned on 15 May because of poor weather . Yet another attempt on 28 May was foiled by bad weather , but a German convoy was successfully attacked on 1 June . One ammunition ship was sunk and two others were set on fire . 
 Furious and the fleet carriers Formidable and Indefatigable made another attempt to sink the Tirpitz on 17 July , in Operation Mascot . For this attack the carrier embarked 880 Squadron with three Seafire <unk> , 20 Grumman Hellcats of 1840 Squadron , Barracudas of 830 Squadron and three Swordfish of 842 Flight . The Barracudas , heavily loaded with bombs of up to 1 @,@ 600 @-@ pound ( 730 kg ) , launched using a wooden ramp : an early example of what was to be later named the ski @-@ jump . The attack was unsuccessful against the fully alerted German defences as a smokescreen covered the German battleship so that the Barracudas had to drop their bombs blindly through the smoke . Four more attacks on Tirpitz were made in August under the name of Operation Goodwood in a concerted effort to sink her . Furious carried twelve Seafire <unk> of 801 Squadron , another twelve Seafire <unk> of 880 Squadron and nine Barracudas of 827 Squadron for this operation . The first attack on 20 August was recalled because of bad weather , but the attack on 22 August was spotted by the Germans and 11 aircraft were lost . Another attack was made two days later ; one armour @-@ piercing bomb penetrated Tirpitz 's armoured deck but failed to detonate , and another 500 @-@ pound ( 230 kg ) bomb did only superficial damage . A fourth attack was made on 29 August , but inflicted no damage . 
 By this time the ship 's age and limitations became increasingly apparent and she was placed in reserve on 15 September 1944 . The ship was paid off in April 1945 and , berthed at Loch <unk> , was used to evaluate the effects of aircraft explosives on the ship 's structure . Furious was sold in 1948 for scrap , and had been completely broken up in Troon by 1954 .

 Warning from Space ( <unk> , <unk> Tokyo ni <unk> , Spacemen Appear in Tokyo ) is a Japanese science fiction tokusatsu film released in January 1956 by Daiei , and was the first Japanese science fiction film to be produced in color . In the film 's plot , starfish @-@ like aliens disguised as humans travel to Earth to warn of the imminent collision of a rogue planet and Earth . As the planet rapidly accelerates toward Earth , a nuclear device is created at the last minute and destroys the approaching world . 
 The film , directed by Koji Shima , was one of many early Japanese monster films quickly produced after the success of Toho 's Godzilla in 1954 . The film was loosely based on a novel by Gentaro Nakajima . After release , the film was met with negative reviews , with critics calling it " bizarre " and accusing it of using science fiction clichés . Warning from Space influenced many other Japanese science fiction films , such as Gorath . The film , along with other 1950s science fiction films , influenced director Stanley Kubrick , who would later direct 2001 : A Space Odyssey . 
 = = Plot = = 
 A small ship travels to a rotating space station . Aboard the station , a group of starfish @-@ like beings discuss how to warn humans of an impending disaster , deciding on contacting Japanese scientist Dr. Kumara . Meanwhile , flying saucers are spotted over the skies of Tokyo , baffling scientists . A journalist tries to get a statement from Dr. Kumara about the sightings , but Kumara replies that there is not enough evidence to formulate a hypothesis . At an observatory , Professor Isobe spots an object in his telescope apparently releasing smaller objects . 
 Isobe discusses his findings with Kumara and a physician , Dr. Matsuda , who believes they should get photographs via a rocket . The photographs they retrieve , however , turn out to be unclear , though they deduce the object has a high energy output . In the meantime , the extraterrestrials have been unsuccessfully attempting to contact humans . They begin appearing in lakes and rivers , frightening local fishermen and sailors . One of the aliens manages to secure a photo of Hikari Aozora , a famous Japanese entertainer . Their plan is for one of the aliens to mutate into the form of Aozora . Back aboard the space station , one of the Pairan leaders , Ginko , volunteers herself . Her starfish form is slowly mutated into a human form . 
 On Earth , Toru , Isobe 's son , discovers the disguised alien floating in the water . After her rescue , she exhibits superhuman characteristics such as jumping ten feet and materializing in different places without walking . Soon , she disrupts Dr. Matsuda 's work on a nuclear device , explaining she understands the complex equations he was writing and warning against the effects of a device , leading him to believe she is not human . Shortly afterwards , as the team of scientists discuss her abnormal traits , the camouflaged Ginko appears and reveals her true identity , explaining she is from <unk> , a world on the same orbit as Earth but on the opposite side of the Sun . She then continues to reveal her mission , to warn Earth of an imminent collision of a rogue planet , which is dubbed " Planet R " by the media . They appeal to the World Congress about the situation , but are swiftly rejected . Only after they show Planet R and its rapid acceleration in the telescope does the World Congress launch its nuclear weapons , which ineffectively explode on its surface . 
 In the meantime , a group of spies have abducted Matsuda and are attempting to steal his formula to the nuclear device the disguised Pairan warned him about . Matsuda does not comply and is eventually tied to a chair in a remote building . As the Earth 's atmosphere heats up due to the approaching world , Ginko again arrives to learn why Planet R is not yet destroyed . They locate Matsuda through Pairan technology and gather the formula for the device . The scientists then all watch as the nuclear device is shot from the space station and destroys Planet R , cooling the atmosphere and removing the threat . Ginko then changes back to her original form aboard the space station .

 After the success of Toho 's 1954 film Godzilla , which depicted a giant dinosaur attacking Tokyo , many Japanese film studios began to produce similar monster films , including Warning from Space . Along with other films such as <unk> 's Terrifying Attack of the Flying Saucers and the American Forbidden Planet , Warning from Space became part of a fledgling subgenre of films based around science fiction creatures . The film also used the theme of atomic bombs that was present in many films at the time , but showed how the weapons , which devastated the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki a decade earlier , could be put to good use . Still others noted the film used another common theme of cosmic collisions in the style of earlier films such as the 1931 film End of the World , which depicted a comet on a collision course with the Earth . 
 The Pairan aliens were designed by the prominent avant @-@ garde artist Tarō Okamoto , which used a single eye that is common among science fiction aliens . Although official film posters showed the Pairan aliens towering over buildings , the actual cinematic version of the aliens were on the scale of humans , at about two meters . Walt Lee reports that Gentaro Nakajima 's novel , on which this film was based , was in turn based on the Japanese folktale Kaguya @-@ hime . The film was one of fourteen Japanese color pictures produced in early 1956 , but the first color Japanese science @-@ fiction film .

 Warning From Space was released in Japan in 1956 . Daiei also hoped to find a foreign market for Warning from Space , though the company found difficulty in selling it . Nevertheless , the film played at both King Cinema in Rangoon , Burma and Tai Khoon Theatre in Sandakan , Malaysia , in 1958 . The film did help Daiei achieve some success in the genre . It was passed for release , anglicized as Warning from Space , by the BBFC in the United Kingdom in 1957 , and later in the United States in 1963 . It was picked up by American International Television later in the 1960s . The film was released in Spain as Asalto a la Tierra , and in France as Le Satellite <unk> . Warning from Space has since fallen into the public domain , allowing companies to distribute the free film on DVD .

 From retrospective reviews , a review included in the book A Guide to Apocalyptic Cinema , author Charles P. Mitchell called the film " bizarre " and gave it two stars . Similarly , in a 1978 issue of the magazine Cue , viewers were warned " don 't watch it . " In the 1986 Encyclopedia of Science Fiction Movies by Phil Hardy and Denis Gifford , the film is accused of using the science fiction clichés of flying saucers and atomic bombs . Gyan Prakash , in his book Noir <unk> : <unk> Images of the Modern City , called the film " charming . " The film was noted for its misleading characterization of astronomers , with one author observing that it advanced the cinematic portrayal of astronomers as scientists in lab coats peering through an enormous telescope . 
 In his biography of Stanley Kubrick , author John Baxter traces Kubrick 's interest in science fiction films , which led to his 2001 : A Space Odyssey , to the Japanese kaiju <unk> films of the 1950s , including Warning from Space , with its " nameless two @-@ metre @-@ tall black starfish with a single central eye , who walk en pointe like ballet dancers . " Baxter notes that despite their " clumsy model sequences , the films were often well @-@ photographed in colour ... and their dismal dialogue was delivered in well @-@ designed and well @-@ lit sets .

 Warning from Space influenced Toho 's Gorath , a 1963 film which depicts a rogue planet on a collision course with Earth . The planet <unk> in Warning from Space may have been an influence in the Daiei films Gamera vs. <unk> and Gamera : Super Monster , which feature the planet Tera , another planet on the opposite of Earth 's orbit . Critics have also noted plot similarities to the later Toho film Monster Zero , in that a friendly planet warns Japan of the atom bomb and subsequently assists in celestial defense . The <unk> ' <unk> appearance is similar to that of a later <unk> creation , Starro , a villain from DC Comics ' Justice League .

 " Fatbeard " is the seventh episode of the thirteenth season of the American animated television series South Park . The 188th overall episode of the series , it originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 22 , 2009 and in the United Kingdom on April 24 , 2009 . It was the mid @-@ season finale , marking the final South Park episode for six months . In the episode , Cartman misinterprets news reports about piracy in the Indian Ocean to mean the return of the classic era of swashbuckling pirates , and misleads a handful of South Park boys to voyage to Mogadishu to start a pirate crew . 
 The episode was written and directed by series co @-@ founder Trey Parker , and was rated TV @-@ MA L in the United States for strong to extreme language . " Fatbeard " was a reference to increasing international media attention to piracy in the Indian Ocean , and the script depicted the pirates in a sympathetic light . The crew of the USS Bainbridge , the Arleigh Burke @-@ class guided missile destroyer which participated in the rescue of the hijacked MV Maersk Alabama , contacted the South Park creators to praise them for the episode . " Fatbeard " received generally positive reviews and was seen by 2 @.@ 59 million households in its original broadcast , making it the most @-@ watched Comedy Central production the week it aired .

 Having misunderstood the news about an upsurge of piracy in the Indian Ocean , Cartman excitedly tells his friends the classic era of piracy has returned , and asks the boys to join him in becoming a pirate in what he describes as a responsibility @-@ free life in a warm tropical paradise . Sensing an opportunity to get rid of Cartman once and for all , Kyle encourages him to go , even offering to help pay for his ticket . Although Butters , Ike , Clyde and Kevin are the only students who agree to join his crew , an undaunted Cartman uses his mother 's credit card to book a trip to Somalia . After a long flight and a 49 @-@ hour bus ride , the boys arrive in Mogadishu dressed as stereotypical pirates . Once there , however , they are shocked to find themselves in a desolate land , the complete opposite of their expectations . 
 They quickly find the pirates , who are shocked that anyone would knowingly venture into their base . The pirates decide to ransom the boys to the first European vessel they find . The boys confidently go with them , believing they are being taken to a pirate ship , but are once again disappointed when they are taken to a small motorboat . Eventually , the pirates find a French schooner and demand a ransom of five thousand euros in exchange for the boys ' lives . Meanwhile in South Park , Kyle happily claims partial credit for sending Cartman to Somalia and expects things will be better without Cartman around . But when his parents discover a farewell letter from Ike , Kyle realizes his brother has run off with Cartman to Somalia , and he sets off for Mogadishu to bring his brother home . Back in Somalia , the ransom is paid and the boys are surrendered . Once on board , however , Cartman assumes control of the schooner and orders the crew to get onto the lifeboat . Although the captain initially refuses , Kevin brandishes a toy lightsaber , frightening the French crew into abandoning ship . Cartman and the boys return to Mogadishu with the captured vessel , giving several bundles of Euros to the pirates . The pirates are initially shocked , but begin to respect Cartman . Unimpressed by their lack of " pirate " traits , he in turn leads them in raiding ships via a traditional sea shanty called " Somalian Pirates , We " , and starts fashioning them into a stereotypical pirate crew . 
 Meanwhile , the French crew is rescued by a cargo ship , and the U.S. Navy is deployed by NATO after getting word from the cargo ship captain that the pirates now have " advanced weaponry " ( which was really just Kevin 's toy lightsaber , that the French crew thought was real ) . Kyle arrives in Mogadishu , but is immediately taken captive by the pirates and held hostage . He pleads with Cartman to let him and his brother leave , but Cartman refuses , believing that Kyle is simply jealous of his new pirate life . Meanwhile , an English @-@ speaking pirate named <unk> asks Butters and Ike why they decided to become pirates . When they say that they left because they were tired of things like school , chores , homework , and being yelled at by adults , <unk> responds by telling them that he dreamed of a simple life going to school , and that his mother is suffering with AIDS but cannot be treated , and his father was killed in an attempt to find food for his family . He never set out to be a pirate , but was forced into piracy to support his family . Realizing how close @-@ minded they 've been , Butters and Ike admit that a life of piracy is one of hardship and suffering , not fun and adventure like normal life can be . They then tell Cartman that they want to return home , but he refuses to give up his romantic delusions of grandeur and threatens the boys with death by calling the real pirates to hold them at gunpoint . However , Cartman 's vision is quickly disrupted when a U.S Navy ship hired by NATO appears off the coast carrying snipers , who shoots all of Cartman 's pirate colleagues with a single gunshot to each of their heads . This leaves Cartman dumbfounded and annoyed .

 " Fatbeard " was written and directed by series co @-@ creator Trey Parker . It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on April 22 , 2009 and was the mid @-@ season finale , marking the final South Park episode until October 2009 . " Fatbeard " is based on real @-@ life piracy in the Indian Ocean , which began receiving increasing international media attention in 2008 until its demise in 2012 / 2013 . 
 The episode began production two weeks before its airdate , with the intention to broadcast it on April 15 , 2009 . The writing team had developed the idea for Cartman mistaking Somalian piracy for classic piracy amid the pirate hijacking of the MV Maersk Alabama at the time . Captain Richard Phillips was taken hostage in the event , and Parker and Stone decided to hold the episode indefinitely , although animation had begun . Realizing the severity of the situation — if Phillips were killed and the South Park episode seemed to mock the situation — they decided to resume work on the episode " Pinewood Derby " , which had been in production for a while , as the creators had no idea to where to go with its story . When Phillips was rescued over the weekend , they wanted to resume work on " Fatbeard " , but as animation work on the episode proved difficult , including new sets depicting Somalia , it was decided it would be unfeasible . 
 The episode 's ending was unusual , as many episodes of South Park tend to resolve the episode 's events ; in " Fatbeard " , the main characters don 't return home and are shown at the end still in Somalia . An alternate ending made it to the animatic stage , in which Cartman , in a self @-@ referential manner , congratulates the show on the conclusion of the season and invites the season 's celebrity parodies ( among those the Jonas Brothers and Kanye West ) . The ending , which Parker likened to that of a variety show , was something he felt was funny in writing but didn 't succeed visually . 
 While most South Park episodes feature Parker and Stone providing almost all the voice acting , " Fatbeard " included several French @-@ speaking actors providing the lines of the schooner crew . Outside voice actors were also brought in for the role of the Somalian pirates , including Abdi Fatah <unk> , Dahir Ali , Abdullahi Prime , and Julien <unk> . The week after its original broadcast , in response to requests by fans , the full 90 @-@ second version of episode 's sea shanty song , " Somalian Pirates , We " was made available for download on South Park Studios , the official South Park website . Shortly after " Fatbeard " was originally broadcast , the site also featured six different types of T @-@ shirts and hooded sweatshirts based on the episode .

 The ending , in which the pirates are each shot to death by American snipers , reflects the resolution of the pirate hijacking of the MV Maersk Alabama in April 2009 , where U.S. Navy SEALs rescued the captain after three snipers simultaneously killed three pirates with one shot each . They are portrayed in a particularly sympathetic light when they are killed during the ending . Travis Fickett of IGN said , " It 's one of those moments where South Park feels the need to give voice to a side the media is ignoring — and points out that things aren 't quite as cut and dry [ sic ] as we might like . " The episode has also been described as a commentary on the way in which Americans tend to take their relative wealth and comfort for granted . A U.S. Navy SEAL ordering another to " not hit the white ones " has also been described as an indictment of the American approach to foreign policy .

 Ike indicates he will " vomit my balls out through my mouth " if he has to hear anything more about Susan Boyle , the Scottish amateur singer who gained worldwide attention around the time of the episode 's airing for her performance of the song " I Dreamed a Dream " from Les Misérables on the show Britain 's Got Talent . The Boyle reference in particular received a great deal of media attention the week " Fatbeard " first aired . Cartman says that Jewish people , Mexicans , and ginger @-@ haired people are not allowed to be pirates . The French schooner crew members are portrayed as pretentious cowards , a stereotype of the French based on the government 's surrender during World War II . The schooner itself strongly resembles the French luxury yacht Le <unk> , which was seized by Somali pirates in April 2008 . Cartman refers to Blackbeard , the famous English pirate from the 17th and 18th centuries , from whom the episode derives its name . Much of the décor and music in the episode is influenced by the Pirates of the Caribbean theme park ride and associated film franchise . Kevin wields a toy lightsaber , the Jedi weapon from the Star Wars films ; this is also a reference to the sixth season episode " The Return of the Fellowship of the Ring to the Two Towers " , in which he dresses as an Imperial stormtrooper while the rest of the boys are in Lord of the Rings attire .

 In its original American broadcast , " Fatbeard " was watched by 2 @.@ 59 million overall households , according to the Nielsen ratings , making it the most @-@ watched Comedy Central production of the week . The episode received generally positive reviews . Carlos Delgado of If magazine , who gave the episode an A- grade , particularly praised the Cartman and Ike characters and called the ending " perfect " . Delgado said of the show 's creators , " These guys see episode potential in nearly everything that passes through the news desk . And because South Park can be made in like a week — and I ’ m talking start to finish , from concept to finished product — they end up being the most socially conscious and timely show on television today . " Ken Tucker of Entertainment Weekly praised the episode and the Somalian pirate song , and complimented the show for presenting the pirates as sympathetic human beings . Sean O 'Neal of The A.V. Club said the portrayal of Somalian pirates was a predictable storyline , but said he enjoyed the episode because of the pacing : " Rather than a cobbled @-@ together collection of gags , everything progressed very organically . " IGN writer Travis Fickett said the episode was amusing but not exceptional . Fickett enjoyed the takeover of the French vessel and the extent to which Cartman 's delusion about pirates takes him , but he said the pirate plot " isn 't entirely in good taste ( and ) it never really gathers a full head of steam " . 
 The crew of the USS Bainbridge , the Arleigh Burke @-@ class guided missile destroyer which participated in the rescue of Richard Phillips from the hijacked MV Maersk Alabama , contacted the creators of South Park to commend them on the episode . Ensign Jonathan Sieg , the Bainbridge public relations officer , wrote : " Pretty much everyone onboard our ship — from Captain to seaman — is a huge fan of South Park , and when we heard about the episode Fatbeard , as you can imagine , we were thrilled and very interested to watch . " Sieg requested copies of the episode because the streaming online video was difficult to watch on the ship , and the South Park staff in return sent them a care package including several copies of the episode . On the official South Park Studios FAQ , they wrote back , " No , sir , thank you . We were honored to read that , and making an episode about you kicking pirate booty was our pleasure . "

 The first song completed in Los Angeles for Paramore , " Ain 't It Fun " was produced by musician Justin Meldal @-@ Johnsen . Development for the song started in a hotel room , where Taylor York created an audio loop with his keyboard , which Williams likened to works by Siouxsie and the Banshees and Paula Abdul . Upon hearing it , Hayley Williams proposed that they should write lyrics to it . Later , Williams and York started layering their voices to imitate those of gospel choir members . Six months later , they recorded with a gospel choir composed of six individuals : Brandon Hampton , Joslyn James , Katherine and Sean Dancy , Talitha Manor and Yolanda Harris @-@ Dancy . Williams , who was familiarized with gospel music , linked the inclusion of a gospel choir in the song to her upbringing , in which she frequently went to churches . Williams stated that the song was inspired by the band 's " roots " , explaining that she had grown up with " pop , funk and soul " . 
 Jeremy Davis — the band 's bassist — expounded on what they felt before releasing the song , " After we started writing weird stuff like ' Ain 't It Fun ' , we got nervous . But that was a comfort . We 've grown and we don 't like the same music we liked , so why would [ our fans ] not ? That idea kept us pushing ourselves . " York considered that the decision to bring a gospel choir would have been difficult to approve if the original lineup of the band had remained . The track was mixed by Ken Andrews , and mastered by Ted Jensen at Sterling Sound Studios .

 Written in the key of E major , " Ain 't It Fun " paces at a moderate tempo of 104 beats per minute . The song features instrumentation from a " happy " xylophone and a " rubbery " bass guitar . An editor of the Corvallis Gazette @-@ Times described its melody as " cheery " and " propulsive " , while Sean Adams from Drowned in Sound called it " infectious " . Although its main genre is pop rock , Adams and Rebecca Nicholson of The Guardian denoted the song as delving into pop , more than the band 's previous material . The former also compared it to the works of Incubus , while Nicholson stated , " [ it ] sounds as if Alexander O 'Neal has just discovered Refused 's back catalogue " . Theon Weber of Spin labeled it as " bouncy " while denoting it as a new wave song . Writing for The A.V. Club , Annie Zaleski described the song as a mixture of rhythm and blues and pop ; Jon Dolan of Rolling Stone characterized it as " soul @-@ powered " . Cameron Adams from News.com.au described it as a funk rock song , while Scott Heisel from Alternative Press classified it as a " blast of new jack swing " . Barbara Schultz at Common Sense Media categorized it as a " funky alt @-@ rock arrangement " . 
 The gospel choir first appears in the song during its bridge . Referencing the choir 's feature , David Renshaw of NME commented that the song " pull [ s ] a Sister Act 2 . " The vocal ranges of Williams and the gospel choir spans from B3 to C ♯ 5 . The former 's vocal performance was described by Stereogum 's Chris DeVille as having influences of Michael Jackson , whereas Zaleski compared Williams ' vocal style in " Ain 't It Fun " to that of Mariah Carey . Heisel considered that the participation of the choir helped Williams sing " some of her most soulful vocals ever . " Joseph R. Atilano of the Philippine Daily Inquirer further analyzed Williams ' vocal performance in the song : 
 [ ... ] lead vocalist Hayley Williams is starting to show more of her musical chops – from her crooning to the soulful “ touches ” in her singing style , particularly in this single . These nuances in her voice signify to me that , vocally , she has entered her prime already . You can hear these changes specifically in the chorus and refrain sections of this single wherein she sings with greater confidence . Here , the versatility of her voice takes shape and we begin to take serious notice of what she can do more behind the mic . 
 The track 's lyrics , structured in verse – chorus form and written in second person narrative , predominantly feature a sarcastic tone . They were inspired by Williams ' decision to move from Nashville to Los Angeles . She considered this idea after feeling overwhelmed by the repercussion , in Nashville , of Josh and Zac Farro 's departure from Paramore . Williams said , " I took off for L.A. as if it was going to be some kind of paradise or saving grace . I got there and realized that my problems were following me . Okay , so I was having a bad six months ? Get over it . [ sic ] " The song was penned as a message regarding her behavior , in order for her to cope with her decision . She stated , " No one else was saying that to me , so I had to say it to myself . " musicOMH 's Thomas Ingham interpreted its lyrics as focusing on a " serious ' all alone in the world ' " theme , while Corvallis Gazette @-@ Times 's journalist called them " blunt " and wrote that they discuss " growing up " . The writer also believed that its theme would make the song a prominent track at graduation ceremonies . Atilano viewed a contrast between the song 's melody and lyrical content . However , he noted that its " sunny " sonority made it " pleasant " to hear .

The video shoot continued into August , when Williams posted a picture of the band in the set . Two months later , however , the band posted a statement where they revealed that the video had been cancelled . Williams cited " unhappiness with the direction the video was headed " as an explanatory factor ; in replacement , a video for " Daydreaming " was filmed . 
 A new visual for the song , directed by Sophia Peer , was shot on December 2 of that year in Franklin , Tennessee . Peer stated that she wanted the video to " reflect " the message she retained from the song — " you had to push yourself out of your comfort zone and challenge yourself " . She began by brainstorming ideas for the visual , and she talked to Alexandra Young and the video 's editor Winston Case , who suggested her the concept of breaking world records . Peer selected 30 records for the band to break , nonetheless , they reduced the number due to the short length of the video shoot . The records selected were picked to match " different sections of the song " and were based on other already @-@ existent records . 
 To promote the video , Paramore associated with <unk> , convincing fans to create their own world records . No partnerships were established with Guinness World Records ; Peer commented , " <unk> is much more inclusive than Guinness , therefore cooler .

 " Fishsticks " is the fifth episode of the thirteenth season of the American animated television series South Park . The 186th overall episode of the series , it was originally broadcast on Comedy Central in the United States on April 8 , 2009 . In the episode , Jimmy writes a joke that becomes a national sensation , and Cartman tries to steal the credit while Rapper Kanye West is the only person in the country who fails to get the joke , but cannot admit that he does not get it because he believes himself to be a genius . 
 The episode was written and directed by series co @-@ creator Trey Parker , and was rated TV @-@ MA L in the United States . The episode was conceived from a joke among Parker and fellow co @-@ creator Matt Stone about a fish dressed as motorcycle daredevil Evel Knievel , which eventually turned into a joke about Kanye West not understanding a joke about why liking fishsticks made him a gay fish . The way Cartman tries to steal credit for the joke was inspired by real people Parker and Stone have worked with in the television business . 
 Parker provided the voice of West in the episode and during the song " Gay Fish " , a parody of West 's song " Heartless " . " Fishsticks " received largely positive reviews , and generated a great deal of media attention when West wrote in a blog that the episode hurt his feelings , although he said it was funny and admitted that he needed to work on his ego problem . The episode also spoofed comedian Carlos Mencia , who praised the episode after it was broadcast . 
 According to Nielsen Media Research , " Fishsticks " was seen by more than 3 @.@ 1 million households in its original broadcast , making it the most @-@ watched Comedy Central production of the week . The episode received even further attention after West famously interrupted Taylor Swift during her acceptance speech at the September 2009 MTV Video Music Awards , after which Comedy Central replayed the episode four times back @-@ to @-@ back . " Fishsticks " was released on DVD and Blu @-@ ray along with the rest of the thirteenth season on March 16 , 2010 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Jimmy works on writing jokes for his comedy routine while Cartman sits on his couch , eating potato chips . Jimmy comes up with a joke with almost no assistance from Cartman ( he only helped Jimmy originate the joke by telling Jimmy he was hungry for something more substantial than fruit , and Jimmy suggested there might be some fishsticks in the freezer ) : 
 Jimmy : Do you like fishsticks ? Cartman : <unk> : Do you like putting fishsticks in your mouth ? Cartman : <unk> : What are you , a gay fish ? 
 The joke , which plays on the similarity of the phrases " fishsticks " and " fish dicks " when spoken , becomes a hit throughout South Park . When Cartman begins taking half credit for the joke , Kyle tells Jimmy he should stand up to Cartman . When Jimmy tells Cartman he feels he wrote most of the joke , Cartman fears Jimmy will try to take full credit and asks Kyle for advice on how to deal with Jimmy . Kyle instead says he believes Jimmy wrote the entire joke , and suggests that Cartman 's ego is so big that he subconsciously remembers things incorrectly to make himself feel more important . This is supplemented by Cartman 's flashbacks to the creation of the joke , which become more overblown and ridiculous as the episode goes on , showing him to truly believe that he deserves credit . 
 Meanwhile , the joke becomes a national sensation . Comedian Carlos Mencia goes on Conan O 'Brien 's show claiming credit for the joke . The joke is played on rapper Kanye West , who does not understand it . West grows angry when others say he does not get it , and will not allow anyone to explain it to him , because he claims to be a genius and " the voice of a generation " . Kanye abducts Carlos Mencia , who admits he stole the joke to compensate for not being funny and claiming that his " dick don 't work " in a parody of Viggo Mortensen 's character <unk> in Carlito 's Way , but Kanye doesn 't believe him and beats him to death with the help of his hired thugs . Cartman and Jimmy go on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and claim they invented the joke , prompting Kanye to go after them . Jimmy confronts Cartman , asking how he can live with himself for taking credit for a joke he did not write . They are interrupted by Kanye , who threatens to kill them . By now , Cartman has not only convinced himself he wrote the whole joke without Jimmy 's help , but believes he also saved his life from a black widow , slew a dragon , defeated an army of Jew robots , and has powers similar to the Human Torch . Cartman thinks he realizes what Kyle was trying to tell him , but he gets it completely backwards : Cartman believes that Jimmy 's ego is the one that is twisted and Jimmy 's ego trying to convince itself that he wrote the joke , while not accepting that Cartman wrote the whole thing , and Jimmy believes him . Kanye has an epiphany about his own massive ego and believes he finally understands the joke . However , he incorrectly thinks it means he is , in fact , a gay fish . The episode ends with Kanye donning a wetsuit and diving off the Santa Monica Pier into the ocean to embrace his new identity as a gay fish in the form of a music video , in which he happily swims around the sea , kissing and humping random fish . 
 However , in a deleted scene , West drowns and his body is picked up and discovered by the US coast guards .

 " Fishsticks " was written and directed by series co @-@ creator Trey Parker . The concept for " Fishsticks " began when Parker , fellow co @-@ creator Matt Stone , and actor Bill Hader attended a writers ' retreat in Seattle , Washington and they visited a body of water where they could watch salmon jump . They started joking about a salmon wearing an outfit like the motorcycle daredevil Evel Knievel , which eventually reminded them of the music video for rapper Kanye West 's song " Touch the Sky " , in which West himself dresses like Knievel . This led to them picturing a scene with West on a news program , angrily denying reports that he is a fish , shouting " No , I am not a salmon ! " During a four @-@ hour ride in a car , Stone and Parker discussed the joke further , and eventually thought of the " fishsticks " joke that featured prominently in the final episode . The duo said they found it hilarious and told variations of the joke back and forth to each other for the rest of the ride . Stone said , " The van driver we hired was just so bummed because we just kept talking about fishsticks , ' You 're a gay fish ' , over and over . We thought it was so funny , and just the fact that he didn 't get it . " 
 Although the joke originally stemmed from Evel Knievel and not Kanye West , Parker and Stone said they realized West would probably be extremely humorless about the joke and not understand it , so they decided the episode should revolve mostly around him . After coming up with the idea , Parker and Stone waited a long time before they finally wrote the script because , Stone said , " It just seemed too dumb . Are we really going to do a whole episode about this ? " Stone said the jokes about Carlos Mencia were " just a complete afterthought " that came about during the writing process . During one scene in " Fishsticks " , Cartman steals credit from Jimmy for a joke he did not write . This was inspired by people Parker and Stone have worked with in the television business who were present for discussions the duo had , then later claimed credit for the idea even though they had nothing to do with it . Stone said , " They truly believe they did it . That 's the really sinister part . It 's not where they 're trying to steal part of the glory . ... They actually fully believe that they came up with it . " 
 Parker provided the voice of Kanye , both in the episode and in " Gay Fish " , a full @-@ length song featured at the end of the episode about West 's realization that he actually is a gay fish . Parker used a large amount of Auto @-@ Tune pitch audio processing , which he had never used before . Parker said he eventually discovered he had to sing off @-@ key on purpose in order to get the desired effect . Parker said , " You had to be a bad singer in order for that thing to actually sound the way it does . " The day after " Fishsticks " was broadcast , the full two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half minute version of the Kanye West spoof , " Gay Fish " , was made available for download on South Park Studios , the official South Park website . The site also featured T @-@ shirts and hooded sweatshirts based on the episode . One featured Jimmy asking , " Do you like fishsticks ? " The other features text from Kanye West 's whiteboard in the episode : " Fishsticks + Me = <unk> " . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 A Kanye West song in the episode about the fact that he is indeed a " gay fish " is a parody of the West song " Heartless " , from his 2008 recording 808s & Heartbreak and satirizes the rapper 's usage of Auto @-@ Tune pitch audio processing . When West first confronts Cartman and Jimmy , Cartman mistakes him for Puff Daddy , another rapper and record producer . 
 Carlos Mencia , host of the former Comedy Central show Mind of Mencia , is portrayed in " Fishsticks " as knowingly stealing credit for a joke he did not write ; this is a reference to accusations other comedians have made that Mencia plagiarizes jokes from other people . Mencia 's death scene in the episode , as well as his claims that he uses a catheter to relieve himself , are a reference to <unk> , a character who uses a wheelchair in the 1993 crime film Carlito 's Way . 
 Talk show hosts Jimmy Kimmel , David Letterman , Conan O 'Brien , Jay Leno and Ellen DeGeneres were featured in the episode . Kimmel is voiced by his real @-@ life brother Jonathan Kimmel , who previously served as a writer and voice actor on South Park .

 Both Kanye West and Carlos Mencia responded within one day of the episode 's original broadcast and said they enjoyed the parodies of themselves , although Kanye West said on his blog that his feelings were hurt . After the episode was broadcast , Mencia wrote on his Twitter feed , " They just made fun of me on South Park . I thought it was hysterical . Catch the rerun . " Dave Itzkoff , arts reporter for The New York Times , complimented Mencia for his response . West wrote on his blog , " South Park murdered me last night and it 's pretty damn funny . It hurts my feelings but what can you expect from South Park ! " West thanked the South Park writers in his blog entry and acknowledged he has a problem with his ego , but said he was trying to change . Parker and Stone said they were extremely surprised by West 's reaction , and felt Mencia was treated far more harshly in the episode than West . Parker said , " It was like , dude , we just said you were a gay fish . What are you talking about ? It was so dumb . " 
 Simon Vozick @-@ Levinson of Entertainment Weekly said the post was " a fascinating look at where Kanye 's head is at these days " , and complimented West for his " humility and honesty " . Daniel Kreps of Rolling Stone said : " Many have tried , all have failed , but in the end it only took four animated children from Colorado to topple Kanye West 's ego . ... One day , we 'll all look back on this day and thank South Park for ushering in this historic moment in the life of Kanye . " Kerrie Mitchell of Entertainment Weekly suggested West 's modest response was actually a marketing stunt to help sell his upcoming personal fragrance and energy drink . Mitchell wrote , " Did he just get the last laugh on South Park ? Conspiracy ! " In response to the media coverage , West wrote another blog entry on April 10 claiming he had only seen part of the episode and found it funny , but he had been working on his arrogance problem for some time and that South Park did not lead to his " ego epiphany " . The next day , he said in another blog entry that while visiting The Cheesecake Factory restaurant , the manager brought him a plate of fishsticks as a joke . 
 The episode received positive , if slightly mixed reviews . Ramsey Isler of IGN declared it the best episode of the season , calling it a " beautiful Kanye West spoof that was so well @-@ timed , so hilarious and so spot @-@ on " that it became a " phenomenon " . Ryan Brockington of the New York Post said of the episode , " Best . ' South Park . ' Ever . " He particularly praised the West song parody and the fact that " a simple running joke can hold a full episode ; brilliant " . Carlos Delgado of If Magazine said the episode was " another South Park classic " which " takes full advantage of Cartman 's monumental ego " . Delgado , who gave the episode a B + grade , described the West parody as " awesome " and the final scene with the " gay fish " West song as " spell binding " . TV Guide listed the episode at number five on the top ten television moments of the week . 
 Travis Fickett of IGN said the episode included some good laughs but " never kicks into high gear " and said the themes might have worked better as subplots than a full episode : " ' Fishsticks ' is one of those episodes that typically occur around now in the South Park season . It 's not great , not bad – hovering somewhere around amusing towards forgettable . " Sean O 'Neal of The A.V. Club said he was disappointed by the episode and thought the message about celebrity self @-@ delusion might have been better if it focused on only West or Mencia , rather than both . Although O 'Neal liked the West song in the episode 's final scene , O 'Neal said " cramming ( West and Mencia ) together — even mixed in with Cartman 's very funny fantasy sequences — felt too cobbled to me , and the time limits imposed by cutting back and forth between it all made the respective digs start to feel a little too one @-@ note .

 On September 13 , 2009 during the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards , Kanye West interrupted an acceptance speech from Taylor Swift by walking onto stage , grabbing the microphone and praising her fellow nominee , Beyoncé Knowles . The incident received considerable press attention and drew further attention to " Fishsticks " , which Comedy Central re @-@ broadcast for two straight hours on September 15 , 2009 . 
 Kanye West referenced this episode in his song " Gorgeous " from the 2010 album My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy where he says " choke a South Park writer with a <unk> " . He similarly referenced the episode on his album Watch the Throne in the song " Made in America " when he says " South Park had them all <unk> ' / Now all my niggas designing and we all <unk> ' . "

 = Beatriz Michelena = 
 Beatriz Michelena ( February 22 , 1890 – October 10 , 1942 ) was a Venezuelan American actress during the silent film era , known at the time for her operatic soprano voice and appearances in musical theatre . She was one of the few Latina stars visible on the silver screen in the United States in the 1910s . She was the leading lady in each film project she was involved in , and co @-@ founded a production company with her husband , producing four of her own movies . 
 She wrote popular articles for newspapers , including an advice column for girls , describing what it was like to be an actress , and answering questions from readers . For adult readers , Michelena wrote other pieces such as a history of the moving picture industry . In 1920 when she stopped making films , she returned to her career as a singer . 
 Michelena faded from historiography for many years , but her place in history has recently been re @-@ examined ; she was mentioned in 2002 in a presidential proclamation and her 1914 film Salomy Jane is enjoying a limited re @-@ release . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Beatriz Michelena was reportedly born in New York City in 1890 , six years after her sister Vera Michelena , and around the same time that her father , Fernando Michelena ( 1858 @-@ 1921 ) , a noted Venezuelan @-@ born tenor , was singing the title role of the opera Ernani with a traveling theatre company that performed famous operas translated to English for American audiences . ( She listed her birthplace as New York in the 1920 US Census , but in the 1930 census she said California . ) Over much of her childhood , Michelena ’ s parents toured with the Emma Abbott Grand Opera Company . Beatriz 's father in later life taught music and worked as a vocal coach and , at the time of his death , was serving as president of Arrillaga Musical College , San Francisco . Beatriz and her sister Vera were trained by their father in classical voice and drama studies , and they followed in his footsteps by beginning singing careers of their own . Vera first appeared onstage in the Princess Chic Opera company ( 1901 ) at 17 , taking a leading role in The Man from China ( 1904 ) . Beatriz , too , performed with Princess Chic in 1901 , taking chorus roles suitable for a child of 11 . By mid @-@ 1904 , with Vera busy pursuing her career in New York , Fernando Michelena settled in San Francisco , California to teach voice . There , he raised Beatriz and continued to train her , a soprano , in operatic vocal techniques . He passed his stage experience to his daughter : the way to move as another person , the way to make simple but authoritative gestures , and the way to build intensity over the span of a performance . Maria Antonia Field , a Californian writer , would later chronicle her time as a student of Michelena ’ s father in her book , Five Years of Vocal Study under Fernando Michelena . 
 = = Marriage and stage career = = 
 On Sunday , March 3 , 1907 , Michelena married George E. Middleton , a prominent San Francisco automobile dealer , the " happy culmination " of a romance that had begun in their school days . The private wedding took place at 232 <unk> Street , the home of the parents of bridesmaid Margaret McGovern , " a lifelong friend of the bride " . Judge Thomas F. Graham performed the ceremony . The couple spent a few weeks in Los Angeles for their honeymoon . 
 Middleton was the manager of the local Middleton Motor Car Company and the son of a California timber baron . He introduced Michelena to his society friends and business partners , including the trustees of Charles Crocker 's estate who had rebuilt the St. Francis Hotel after the 1906 earthquake and fire . 
 After two years spent absent from the stage , in October 1910 , " Beatriz Michelena Middleton " received a " full ovation " at the Garrick Theater for her role in The White Hen , a musical comedy set in Austria . <unk> comedian Max Dill , leader of the acting company , was the star of the show , given 14 minutes of applause upon entering the stage . For her performance , Michelena was sent flowers worth " a small fortune " , according to the San Francisco Call 's theater writer , Walter Anthony . Starring actress Lora Lieb , native to San Francisco but unknown as a performer , took less applause . 
 Middleton and Michelena gave an interview to Anthony after The White Hen was an established hit . Middleton said that he had kept his wife off the stage , that he " didn 't like the idea of musical comedy " , but would not have objected to her appearance in " grand opera " . Nonetheless , he agreed to an offer from Max Dill . Michelena said that she had so far spent her married life studying to perform three operatic roles : Carmen and Micaëla in Carmen , and Violetta Valéry in La traviata . She said that prior to appearing at the Garrick Theater , she had been afraid that her stage training had been lost . Michelena said she had to overcome her own fears as well as her husband 's objections . 
 At the end of November , Michelena quit Dill 's company , reporting that she had been billed underneath Lora Lieb in theater publicity , against the arrangement she had made with company manager Nat A. <unk> . She said she refused to put her famous family name in second place . 
 On December 6 , 1910 , a story in the Call talked about Michelena and her sister having been " discovered " seven years previously by John Slocum , the manager who worked with the girls in the Princess Chic company . According to the story , Slocum had been trying to get Michelena to sign a long @-@ term contract , but was beaten out in that regard by Middleton , " the athlete and clubman about town " , whom she had married . A week earlier , Michelena had " caused a sensation " by resigning from the Max Dill company , but subsequently agreed to appear for four performances in Slocum 's traveling production of The Kissing Girl , normally featuring Michelena 's good friend , the actress Texas Guinan , who was willing to step down for a few days while Michelena covered the starring role of Christina . Michelena was quoted as saying , 
 " Leo Cooper , seven years ago , insisted that Mr. Slocum should hear two youngsters sing . The youngsters were Vera and myself . He was good enough to have confidence in us and gave us positions in his ' Princess Chic ' company , where we rose afterward , through his encouragement and help , to prima donna posts . In memory of these kindnesses of the past and because I love the work , I have been happy to say ' yes ' to his request that I appear with his company a few times for auld lang <unk> before ' The Kissing Girl ' goes on her <unk> way . " 
 Following the three performances in San Francisco and one in Oakland , Michelena and her husband took seats in the audience to watch Guinan perform the play 's title role in San Jose 's Victory Theater on December 15 . 
 Michelena excelled in a singing role in The Tik @-@ Tok Man of Oz in 1913 . That year , during the autumn season , Michelena was a featured star of the Mechanics ' Fair , an engineering and auto show in San Francisco . Following that , she sang at the inauguration of the Lincoln Highway , the nation 's first transcontinental road . The western terminus celebration at the Valencia Theatre in San Francisco was organized by the Motor Car Dealers ' Association , October 31 , 1913 . 
 = = California Motion Picture Company = = 
 Middleton set up the California Motion Picture Company ( CMPC ) in San Rafael in 1912 for the purpose of shooting promotional footage of the automobiles he was selling . He determined that his pretty wife could star in movies made by his company . By 1914 , Middleton and Michelena were making three major films at the same time . 
 The first feature completed by CMPC was Salomy Jane , screened initially at the St. Francis Hotel by invitation only . Michelena 's role was Bret Harte 's Salomy Jane Clay , an energetic daughter of an emigrant miner . She is wooed by four men but prefers a fifth played by British heartthrob House Peters . The movie saw limited nationwide distribution and was judged a hit by viewers who were impressed by the wild California scenery : giant redwood trees , winding roads hugging rocky bluffs and the Russian River Michelena 's dominant portrayal of the title role was also an appeal . Journalist Josephine Clifford McCracken wrote of her in the June 1915 issue of Overland Monthly : 
 " Daughter of a renowned tenor of San Francisco 's pioneer days , herself a prima donna with an assured place on the modern operatic stage , a girl with a wealth of artistic tradition behind her , Miss Michelena 's gifts do not stop there . She has rare beauty , vivacity , wit , intellectual attainments and athletic grace . " 
 One CMPC shooting location was on family property near Boulder Creek , California where Middleton 's father had established a timber holding now known as the Middleton Tract . Other filming locations included undeveloped portions of Sonoma , Santa Cruz and Marin counties . In San Rafael , the studio boasted a large glass @-@ walled and <unk> building that let in light but not wind so that shooting for indoor scenes could take place in full light without the telltale flapping of tablecloths and clothing blown by gusts . Considered expensive at the time , the company used a US $ 1 @,@ 250 Bell & Howell movie camera , worth about $ 29 @,@ 200 in current value . The camera held two reels of film so that two negatives were made of each scene . A second $ 700 camera provided a third reel of the same scene , from another perspective . 
 Even though Salomy Jane didn 't return a profit ( likely due to second @-@ string distribution channels ) , its favorable reception convinced Middleton that his wife could challenge the world 's top movie star , Mary Pickford . Every CMPC movie was from that time forward intended to be a star vehicle for Michelena . Unfortunately , Michelena 's ego expanded with the glowing reviews of her skill , and her demands for star treatment brought heavier expenses to productions that continued to lose money . Mignon , The Lily of Poverty Flat , A Phyllis of the Sierras , Salvation Nell and The Rose of the Misty Pool all failed to turn a profit , and a lavish production of Faust which was in production in 1915 was given until the end of the year to be completed . Faust wasn 't done by January 1916 , and CMPC president Herbert Payne shut the film company down and filed for bankruptcy . Faust was never released . 
 = = Writer = = 
 In 1915 and 1916 , Michelena wrote the regular newspaper column " Talks with Screen @-@ struck Girls " , carried at first by the San Rafael Independent on Tuesdays but then appeared on Sundays in other newspapers : San Francisco Examiner and the Prescott Journal @-@ Miner ( Arizona ) . She wrote about the ideal qualities found in an actress , and what girls might do to develop them . She received a torrent of letters from readers — many were from girls asking " Must I be able to ride " and " Must I be able to swim " . In response , Michelena described in the column how those skills were helpful to a movie actress , but not absolutely necessary ; she said they " are accessories to , rather than the substance of the thing ... I would advise every girl entering motion pictures to learn to ride and swim and do all the rest of it , but I would have her realize their subordination to the really artistic side of the profession . " ' 
 On May 7 , 1916 , Michelena wrote to caution girls wishing for fame on the silver screen that many like themselves ended up " broken in spirit " , with shattered expectations . She advised them to stay home and avoid " bitter disappointment " in movie making . In July , she discussed some of the specifics of the mental challenges of acting : 
 " There are a hundred little peculiarities that index the character of practically every type of person , and it is the effectiveness with which one grasps , understands and utilizes these peculiarities that makes him or her a great dramatic artist ... The truly great actress ... must not only recognize the traits as she sees them outwardly manifested , but she must also get beneath the skin and recognize the conditions of thought or emotion that give rise to them . Then , and this is the really great test of her talents , she must so lose herself in those conditions of thought and emotion , and feel through them , that her mimicry of their outward manifestations comes naturally and without conscious endeavor . " 
 In addition to her column , Michelena wrote occasional articles intended for a wider readership . She wrote in October 1916 about the history of the moving picture industry in a multiple @-@ article series , beginning her account with a retelling of Eadweard Muybridge 's action photograph of Governor Leland Stanford 's racehorse named Occident . She defined this high @-@ speed image as essential to the development of moving pictures .

 Middleton and Michelena bought their bankrupt film company for " a few thousand dollars " in 1917 and renamed it Michelena Studios . Their new company was called Beatriz Michelena Features , and shooting began on their next feature @-@ length film , Just Squaw . Michelena 's lead character was a white woman raised by American Indians , a woman who does not realize her racial heritage until after she falls into forbidden love with a white man . The movie played for only a week in San Francisco in 1919 , and did not return a profit . 
 The moviemakers ' new distributor , Robertson @-@ Cole , was unable to find the right market for Heart of Juanita and The Flame of Hellgate in 1920 . American audiences had grown more sophisticated , yet Michelena Studios was still employing their earlier production techniques . After shooting The Flame of Hellgate , Middleton and Michelena stopped making movies altogether . She returned to her singing performances and he returned to his car sales . They reportedly divorced in the mid @-@ 1920s , though Middleton told the 1930 US Census that they were married . The union produced no children .

 After leaving film work , Michelena continued with her singing career , and toured Latin America ( 1927 ) where she was warmly received as part of a 30 @-@ person troupe of singers and dancers performing the operas Carmen and Madama Butterfly . The San Francisco Chronicle reported that this was " the first invasion of those countries by an American operatic star in repertoire performances " . Afterward , she retired from singing , and returned to San Rafael to live near her old film studio . Between 1937 and 1941 , she sold 10 of the 26 real estate parcels that together had formed her studio lot . On October 10 , 1942 , after a surgical operation in San Francisco , she died at the age of 52 . Her sister Vera Michelena and her ex @-@ husband George Middleton survived her .

 The Michelena Features studio facility in San Rafael sat empty through the 1920s with its solitary metal @-@ clad brick vault housing all the company 's nitrate films , including the earlier ones shot by CMPC . In 1931 , boys playing with a firecracker at the deserted lot set the vault and all of its flammable contents spectacularly on fire . Every known copy of Michelena 's movies was destroyed , a loss that Middleton estimated at $ 200 @,@ 000 ; worth about $ 3 @.@ 1 million today . In 1996 , an 82 @-@ year @-@ old nitrate copy of Salomy Jane was found in Australia ; it was sent to the Library of Congress for preservation . Awareness of Michelena 's contribution to early film , and her role as a groundbreaking Hispanic star , rose in 2002 with a proclamation made by President George W.

In 2008 , a new print of Salomy Jane was released for limited distribution .

 = Lou Groza = 
 Louis Roy Groza ( January 25 , 1924 – November 29 , 2000 ) , nicknamed " The Toe " , was an American football placekicker and offensive tackle who played his entire career for the Cleveland Browns in the All @-@ America Football Conference ( AAFC ) and National Football League ( NFL ) . Groza was professional football 's career kicking and points leader when he retired after the 1967 season . He played in 21 seasons for the Browns , helping the team to win eight league championships in that span . Groza 's accuracy and strength as a kicker influenced the development of place @-@ kicking as a specialty ; he could kick field goals from beyond 50 yards ( 46 m ) at a time when attempts from that distance were a rarity . He set numerous records for distance and number of field goals kicked during his career . 
 Groza grew up in an athletic family in Martins Ferry , Ohio . He enrolled at Ohio State University on a scholarship in 1942 , but enlisted in the U.S. Army and was sent to serve in World War II after just one year in college . Groza deployed as an army surgical technician in the Pacific theater , where he stayed until returning in 1946 to play for the Browns . Helped by Groza 's kicking and play at offensive tackle , the Browns won the AAFC championship every year between 1946 and 1949 , when the league disbanded and the Browns were absorbed by the more established NFL . Cleveland won the NFL championship in its first year in the league on a last @-@ minute field goal by Groza . Groza set NFL records for field goals made in 1950 , 1952 and 1953 . Sporting News named him the league 's Most Valuable Player in 1954 , when the Browns won another championship . The team repeated as NFL champions in 1955 . 
 Groza retired briefly after the 1959 season due to a back injury , but returned in 1961 . He was part of a 1964 team that won another NFL championship . Groza retired for good after the 1967 season . Later in life , he ran an insurance business and served as a team ambassador for the Browns . He was elected to the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1974 . In 1992 , the Palm Beach County Sports Commission named the Lou Groza Award after him . The award is given annually to the country 's best college placekicker . Groza died in 2000 of a heart attack . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Born in eastern Ohio in Martins Ferry , just north and across the Ohio River from Wheeling , West Virginia , Groza 's parents were immigrants from Transylvania , part of modern @-@ day Romania . His Hungarian mother Mary and Romanian father John ( Ioan ) Groza owned and ran Groza 's Tavern on Main Street . Lou was the smallest in stature of four boys in an athletic family ; his brother Alex became a star basketball player at the University of Kentucky , a member of two national championship teams . 
 Groza lettered in football , basketball , and baseball at Martins Ferry High School . The Purple Riders won the state basketball championship in 1941 , when Groza was its captain . He was also captain of the baseball team . Groza learned placekicking from his older brother Frank , and practiced by trying to kick balls over telephone wires when he and his friends played touch football in the street . 
 = = College career and military service = = 
 Groza graduated from high school in 1942 and enrolled on an athletic scholarship at Ohio State University in Columbus , where he played as a tackle and placekicker on the Buckeyes ' freshman team . Groza played in three games and kicked five field goals , including one from 45 yards ( 41 m ) away . In 1943 , he enlisted in the U.S. Army as World War II intensified . He first went for basic training to Abilene , Texas , and then to Brooks General Hospital in San Antonio . 
 After a stint with the short @-@ lived Army Service Training Program , Groza was sent with the 96th Infantry Division to serve as a surgical technician in Leyte , Okinawa , and other places in the Pacific theater in 1945 . The day he landed in the Philippines , Groza saw a soldier shot in the face . He was stationed in a bank of tents about five miles from the front lines and helped doctors tend to the wounded . " I saw a lot of men wounded with severe injuries , " he later said . " Lose legs , guts hanging out , stuff like that . It 's a tough thing , but you get hardened to it , and you accept it as part of your being there . " 
 While he was in the Army , he received a package from Paul Brown , the Ohio State football coach . It contained footballs and a contract for him to sign to play on a team Brown was coaching in the new All @-@ America Football Conference ( AAFC ) . He signed the contract in May 1945 and agreed to join the team , called the Cleveland Browns , after the war ended in 1946 . Groza got $ 500 a month stipend until the end of the war and a $ 7 @,@ 500 annual salary . 
 = = Professional career = = 
 Following his discharge from military service , Groza reported to the Browns ' training camp in Bowling Green , Ohio . He showed up in army fatigues carrying all his clothes in a duffel bag . There , he joined quarterback Otto Graham , fullback Marion Motley and receivers Dante Lavelli and Mac Speedie to form the core of the new team 's offense . Groza was mainly a placekicker in his first two years with the Browns , but he played a big part in the team 's early success . In his first season , he set a professional football record for both field goals and extra points . The Browns , meanwhile , advanced to the AAFC championship against the New York Yankees . Groza sprained his ankle in the game and missed three field goals , but Cleveland won 14 – 9 . Behind a powerful offense led by Graham , Motley and Lavelli , the Browns finished the 1947 season with a 12 – 1 – 1 record and made it back to the championship game . Groza , however , was injured and could only watch as the team won its second championship in a row . 
 Further success followed for the Browns and Groza , who was nicknamed " The Toe " by a sportswriter for his kicking abilities . Groza led the league in field goals and the team won all of its games in 1948 , recording professional football 's first perfect season . As he grew into a star placekicker , Groza began playing regularly at offensive tackle beginning in 1948 . One highlight of that year for Groza was a 53 @-@ yard field goal against the AAFC 's Brooklyn Dodgers that was then the longest kick in pro football history . With Groza , the Browns could attempt field goals at a range many other teams could not . " Anywhere from 40 to 50 yards ( 37 to 46 m ) , he was a weapon , " Tommy James , Groza 's holder for eight years , later said . Another championship win followed in 1949 , but the AAFC dissolved after the season , and the Browns were among three teams absorbed by the more established National Football League ( NFL ) . 
 The war had shortened Groza 's college career , so he continued to study at Ohio State in the offseason in his early years with the Browns . He graduated with a degree in business in 1949 . Groza married that year , to Jackie Lou Robbins , a girl from Martins Ferry who was working as a model in New York City when they first dated . 
 The Browns ' debut in the NFL in the 1950 season was closely watched ; while the team dominated the AAFC in its short existence , some sportswriters , NFL owners and coaches considered the league inferior . Cleveland put all doubts to rest in its first game against the two @-@ time defending champion Philadelphia Eagles , winning 35 – 10 . In a game against the Washington Redskins later in the season , Groza broke a 24 @-@ year @-@ old NFL record by kicking his 13th field goal of the season . He also scored the only touchdown of his career in that game on a reception from Graham . The Browns ended the regular season with a 10 – 2 record in the American Conference , tied with the New York Giants . That forced a playoff against the Giants in which Groza kicked the winning field goal for the Browns with under a minute to play . 
 The Browns next faced the Los Angeles Rams in the championship game . Groza came into the game as the NFL 's leading kicker , both in terms of points scored and accuracy . He had a success rate of 68 @.@ 4 % in an era when most teams made fewer than half of their attempts . The Rams went ahead early in the game on a touchdown pass from star quarterback Bob Waterfield and a scoring run by Dick Hoerner . But Graham and the Browns came back with four touchdowns , two to receiver Dante Lavelli . As time wound down in the fourth quarter , however , the Rams were ahead 28 – 27 , and Cleveland had a final chance to win the game . Graham drove the offense to the Rams ' nine @-@ yard line and set up a Groza field goal attempt . The 16 @-@ yard try sailed through the uprights with 28 seconds left , giving the Browns a 30 – 28 victory . It was the biggest kick of Groza 's career . " I never thought I would miss , " he said later . After the season , Groza was named to the first @-@ ever Pro Bowl , the NFL 's all @-@ star game . 
 Cleveland again reached the championship game in 1951 , but lost this time in a rematch against the Rams . Groza had a 52 @-@ yard field goal in the game , a record for a championship or Super Bowl that stood for 42 years . He was again named to the Pro Bowl after the season . The same scenario was repeated in 1952 and 1953 : the Browns reached the championship both years , but lost both times to the Detroit Lions . Groza was playing with cracked ribs in the 1952 championship loss , and he missed three field goals . Groza set a record in 1953 when he made 23 field goals and had an 88 @.@ 5 % success rate , a single @-@ season mark that stood for 28 years . He made the Pro Bowl again in 1952 and 1953 , and was a first @-@ team All @-@ Pro selection both years . 
 The Browns came back in 1954 to win another championship . That year , Groza was named the NFL 's Most Valuable Player by Sporting News . Cleveland won the championship again in 1955 , beating the Rams 38 – 14 . Groza was named to the Pro Bowl and sportswriters ' All @-@ Pro teams in 1954 and 1955 . 
 Hurt by Graham 's retirement before the season , Cleveland had its first @-@ ever losing season in 1956 . Groza 's kicking continued to be a strength through the ensuing three years : he reached the Pro Bowl in 1957 , 1958 and 1959 , and tied Sam Baker for league leader in points scored in 1957 . Cleveland reached the championship game in 1957 but lost to the Lions . The Browns lost to the New York Giants in a single @-@ elimination playoff in 1958 , and failed to reach the postseason in 1959 . Groza sat out after the 1959 season due to a back injury and was presumed to be retired . While his kicking was his most visible contribution to the team , Groza was also an offensive tackle up until his injury , when Brown replaced him with Dick Schafrath . " Lou never got all the credit he deserved for his tackle play , probably because his great kicking skills got him more notoriety , " Andy <unk> , a defensive end who played against Groza , later said . 
 Groza took 1960 off and did some scouting for the team . He also focused on an insurance business he started . " I was 36 and I thought I had retired , " he said . The following year , however , he came back to the team at the urging of Art Modell , who bought the Browns that year . Not wanting to use a roster spot on a kicking specialist ( Groza 's back injury prevented him from playing on the line ) , Brown had signed Sam Baker to kick and play halfback . But Groza was eager to return and Modell insisted . Groza stayed with the team as a placekicker until 1967 , and was on a Browns team that won the 1964 championship . Groza scored the first points in that game on a third @-@ quarter field goal . He also kicked four kickoffs more than 70 yards ( 64 m ) and out of the Baltimore Colts end zone , preventing a return . Cleveland won 27 – 0 . 
 When Groza retired for good in 1968 after 21 seasons in professional football , he held NFL career records for points scored , field goals made and extra points made . He had 234 field goals , 641 extra points and 1 @,@ 349 total points in the NFL . Counting his AAFC years , his career point total was 1 @,@ 603 . He was the last of the original Browns still on the team . Groza , who was 44 years old when he quit the game , said in his memoir that retiring was " the saddest day of my football life . " His top salary was $ 50 @,@ 000 in his final year . 
 = = Later life and death = = 
 After Groza retired , he entertained an offer to play for the San Francisco 49ers , but was reluctant to do so because he did not want to move his family and insurance business to the West Coast . He was offered a spot with the Browns as a kicking coach , helping mentor the young Don Cockroft , but he declined . Later in life , he became an ambassador and father figure for the Browns , inviting rookies over for dinner and helping them find apartments . He continued to run a successful insurance business and lived in Berea , Ohio near the Browns ' headquarters and training facility . He and his wife Jackie were known as the team 's First Family . 
 Modell relocated the Browns to Baltimore in 1995 and renamed the team the Ravens , provoking a wave of anger and disbelief from fans and former players . Groza was a leading critic of the move , saying it was " like some man walking off with your wife . " In 1996 , Groza wrote a memoir titled The Toe : The Lou Groza Story . The Browns restarted as an expansion team in 1999 . 
 Groza was hobbled in the late 1990s by back and hip surgeries and Parkinson 's disease . He suffered a heart attack in 2000 after dinner with his wife at Columbia Hills Country Club in Columbia Station , Ohio . He was taken to a hospital in Middleburg Heights , Ohio , where he died . He was buried in Sunset Memorial Park in North Olmsted , Ohio . Groza and his wife had three sons and a daughter . Following Groza 's death , the Browns wore his number 76 on their helmets for the 2001 season . 
 = = Legacy and kicking style = = 
 While field goals had long been viewed as an important part of football strategy , kicking specialists were a rarity before Groza 's time . Groza 's success from distances of 40 yards ( 37 m ) and beyond raised the bar for kickers across the league . He set single @-@ season NFL records for accuracy , distance and number of field goals in his first three years in the league , marks that went unbeaten until kicking specialists became a common feature of the game in the early 1970s . Groza 's kicking was the difference in 15 % of the Browns ' games during the AAFC years , and teams began to take notice when his field goals made the difference in both the NFL playoffs and the championship game in 1950 . " Everybody started to pay attention to field goals when the Browns started to win games with them , " Pat Summerall said . Groza led the NFL in field goals made five times in his career . 
 Groza was a straight @-@ ahead kicker . He approached the football in a straight line and booted it with the top of his foot , aiming for the middle of the ball . Early in his career , Groza scraped the ground with his cleats in a straight line to help guide his kicks . Later he put down a piece of one @-@ inch adhesive tape rolled up inside his helmet . The " Lou Groza Rule " in 1950 banned the use of artificial kicking aids , including the tape . The straight @-@ ahead style used by Groza and other kickers of his era has since been supplanted by soccer @-@ style kicking with the side of the foot . " I don 't know why all the kids kick soccer @-@ style , " he said in 1997 . " They kick the ball with the side of their foot , which is supposed to give them better control . I don 't know , I never tried it . " 
 Groza was named to the National Football League 1950s All @-@ Decade Team in 1969 and inducted into the Pro Football Hall of Fame in 1974 . The Browns retired his number 76 ; he is also in the team 's Ring of Honor , a grouping of the best players in the club 's history whose names are displayed below upper @-@ deck seats at FirstEnergy Stadium . In 1992 , the Palm Beach County Sports Commission established the Lou Groza Award , given to the best National Collegiate Athletic Association Football Bowl Subdivision ( formerly Division I @-@ A ) kicker . The Browns ' training facility in Berea , Ohio is located at 76 Lou Groza Boulevard . One of his kicking shoes is part of the collection of the Smithsonian Institution in Washington , D.C ..

 = Paralympic Games = 
 The Paralympic Games is a major international multi @-@ sport event , involving athletes with a range of physical disabilities , including impaired muscle power ( e.g. paraplegia and quadriplegia , muscular dystrophy , post @-@ polio syndrome , spina bifida ) , impaired passive range of movement , limb deficiency ( e.g. amputation or dysmelia ) , leg length difference , short stature , hypertonia , ataxia , <unk> , vision impairment and intellectual impairment . There are Winter and Summer Paralympic Games , which since the 1988 Summer Games in Seoul , South Korea , are held almost immediately following the respective Olympic Games . All Paralympic Games are governed by the International Paralympic Committee ( IPC ) . 
 The Paralympics has grown from a small gathering of British World War II veterans in 1948 to become one of the largest international sporting events by the early 21st century . Paralympians strive for equal treatment with non @-@ disabled Olympic athletes , but there is a large funding gap between Olympic and Paralympic athletes . 
 The Paralympic Games are organized in parallel with the Olympic Games , while the IOC @-@ recognized Special Olympics World Games include athletes with intellectual disabilities , and the <unk> include deaf athletes . 
 Given the wide variety of disabilities that Paralympic athletes have , there are several categories in which the athletes compete . The allowable disabilities are broken down into ten eligible impairment types . The categories are impaired muscle power , impaired passive range of movement , limb deficiency , leg length difference , short stature , hypertonia , ataxia , <unk> , vision impairment and intellectual impairment . These categories are further broken down into classifications , which vary from sport to sport . The classification system has led to cheating controversies revolving around athletes who over @-@ stated their disabilities , in addition to the use of performance @-@ enhancing drugs seen in other events . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Forerunners = = = 
 Athletes with disabilities did compete in the Olympic Games prior to the advent of the Paralympics . The first athlete to do so was German American gymnast George <unk> in 1904 , who had one artificial leg . Hungarian <unk> <unk> competed in shooting events in both the 1948 and 1952 Summer Olympics . He was a right @-@ arm amputee and could shoot left @-@ handed . Another disabled athlete to appear in the Olympics prior to the Paralympic Games was Lis Hartel , a Danish equestrian athlete who had contracted polio in 1943 and won a silver medal in the dressage event . 
 The first organized athletic day for disabled athletes that coincided with the Olympic Games took place on the day of the opening of the 1948 Summer Olympics in London , United Kingdom . German born Dr. Ludwig Guttmann of Stoke Mandeville Hospital , who had been helped to flee Nazi Germany by the Council for Assisting Refugee Academics ( <unk> ) in 1939 , hosted a sports competition for British World War II veteran patients with spinal cord injuries . The first games were called the 1948 International Wheelchair Games , and were intended to coincide with the 1948 Olympics . Dr. Guttman 's aim was to create an elite sports competition for people with disabilities that would be equivalent to the Olympic Games . The games were held again at the same location in 1952 , and Dutch veterans took part alongside the British , making it the first international competition of its kind . These early competitions , also known as the Stoke Mandeville Games , have been described as the precursors of the Paralympic Games . 
 = = = Milestones = = = 
 There have been several milestones in the Paralympic movement . The first official Paralympic Games , no longer open solely to war veterans , was held in Rome in 1960 . 400 athletes from 23 countries competed at the 1960 Games . Since 1960 , the Paralympic Games have taken place in the same year as the Olympic Games . The Games were initially open only to athletes in wheelchairs ; at the 1976 Summer Games , athletes with different disabilities were included for the first time at a Summer Paralympics . With the inclusion of more disability classifications the 1976 Summer Games expanded to 1 @,@ 600 athletes from 40 countries . The 1988 Summer Paralympics in Seoul , South Korea , was another milestone for the Paralympic movement . It was in Seoul that the Paralympic Summer Games were held directly after the Olympic Summer Games , in the same host city , and using the same facilities . This set a precedent that was followed in 1992 , 1996 and 2000 . It was eventually formalized in an agreement between the International Paralympic Committee ( IPC ) and the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) in 2001 , and was recently extended through 2020 . The 1992 Winter Paralympics were the first Winter Games to use the same facilities as the Winter Olympics . 
 = = = Winter Games = = = 
 The first Winter Paralympic Games were held in 1976 in Örnsköldsvik , Sweden . This was the first Paralympics in which multiple categories of athletes with disabilities could compete . The Winter Games were celebrated every four years on the same year as their summer counterpart , just as the Olympics were . This tradition was upheld until the 1992 Games in Albertville , France ; after that , beginning with the 1994 Games , the Winter Paralympics and the Winter Olympics have been held in those even numbered years separate from the Summer Games . 
 = = = Recent games = = = 
 The Paralympic games were designed to emphasize the participants ' athletic achievements and not their disability . Recent games have emphasized that these games are about ability and not disability . The movement has grown dramatically since its early days – for example , the number of athletes participating in the Summer Paralympic games has increased from 400 athletes in Rome in 1960 to over 3 @,@ 900 athletes from 146 countries in Beijing in 2008 . Both the Paralympic Summer and Winter Games are recognized on the world stage . The Paralympics is no longer held solely for British war veterans or just for athletes in wheelchairs , but for elite athletes with a wide variety of disabilities from all over the world . The <unk> allow people with special needs a chance to heal their injuries and take part in the games .

 = = = Forerunners ( 1964 – 1989 ) = = = 
 The first organization dedicated to advancement of athletic opportunities for people with a disability was the International Sports Organization for the Disabled ( ISOD ) , founded in 1964 . The founders of this organization intended it to be a governing body to disability sports what the IOC was to the Olympic Games . This committee eventually became the International Coordinating Committee of World Sports Organizations for the Disabled ( ICC ) , which was established in 1982 . The ICC was tasked with advocating for the rights of athletes with a disability in front of the IOC . After the success of the cooperative effort between the ICC and the IOC , which resulted in the 1988 Summer Paralympics in Seoul , the ICC determined the need to expand and include representatives from all nations that had disability sports programs . They also deemed it necessary to include athletes in the decisions of the Paralympic governing body . Consequently , this body was reorganized as the International Paralympic Committee ( IPC ) in 1989 . 
 = = = IPC ( since 1989 ) = = = 
 The IPC is the global governing body of the Paralympic Movement . It comprises 176 National Paralympic Committees ( NPC ) and four disability @-@ specific international sports federations . The president of the IPC is Philip Craven , a former Paralympian from Great Britain . In his capacity as head of the IPC , Craven is also a member of the International Olympic Committee . The IPC 's international headquarters are in Bonn , Germany . The IPC is responsible for organizing the Summer and Winter Paralympic Games . It also serves as the International Federation for nine sports ( Paralympic athletics , Paralympic swimming , Paralympic shooting , Paralympic powerlifting , Para @-@ alpine skiing , Paralympic biathlon , Paralympic cross @-@ country skiing , ice sledge hockey and Wheelchair <unk> ) . This requires the IPC to supervise and coordinate the World Championships and other competitions for each of the nine sports it regulates . IPC membership also includes National Paralympic Committees and international sporting federations . International Federations are independent sport federations recognized by the IPC as the sole representative of a Paralympic Sport . International Federations responsibilities include technical jurisdiction and guidance over the competition and training venues of their respective sports during the Paralympic Games . The IPC also recognizes media partners , certifies officials , judges , and is responsible for enforcing the bylaws of the Paralympic Charter . 
 The IPC has a cooperative relationship with the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) . Delegates of the IPC are also members of the IOC and participate on IOC committees and commissions . The two governing bodies remain distinct , with separate Games , despite the close working relationship . 
 = = Name and symbols = = 
 Although the name was originally coined as a portmanteau combining " paraplegic " ( due to its origins as games for people with spinal injuries ) and " Olympic , " the inclusion of other disability groups meant that this was no longer considered very accurate . The present formal explanation for the name is that it derives from the Greek preposition <unk> , <unk> ( " beside " or " alongside " ) and thus refers to a competition held in parallel with the Olympic Games . The Summer Games of 1988 held in Seoul was the first time the term " Paralympic " came into official use . 
 “ Spirit in Motion ” is the motto for the Paralympic movement . The symbol for the Paralympics contains three colours , red , blue , and green , which are the colours most widely represented in the flags of nations . The colours are each in the shape of an Agito ( which is Latin for " I move " ) , which is the name given to an asymmetrical crescent specially designed for the Paralympic movement . The three <unk> circle a central point , which is a symbol for the athletes congregating from all points of the globe . The motto and symbol of the IPC were changed in 2003 to their current versions . The change was intended to convey the idea that Paralympians have a spirit of competition and that the IPC as an organization realizes its potential and is moving forward to achieve it . The vision of the IPC is , " To enable Paralympic athletes to achieve sporting excellence and to inspire and excite the world . " The Paralympic anthem is " Hymn de l 'Avenir " or " Anthem of the Future " . It was composed by Thierry <unk> and adopted as the official anthem in March 1996 . 
 = = Ceremonies = = 
 = = = Opening = = = 
 As mandated by the Paralympic Charter , various elements frame the opening ceremony of the Paralympic Games . Most of these rituals were established at the 1920 Summer Olympics in Antwerp . The ceremony typically starts with the hoisting of the host country 's flag and a performance of its national anthem . Unlike the Olympic Games , after the national anthem , the athletes parade into the stadium grouped by <unk> the 1994 Winter <unk> nations enter the stadium alphabetically according to the host country 's chosen language , though with the host country 's athletes being the last to enter . Since the 1988 Summer Paralympics , the host nation presents artistic displays of music , singing , dance , and theatre representative of its culture . 
 Speeches are given , formally opening the games . Finally , the Paralympic torch is brought into the stadium and passed on until it reaches the final torch carrier — often a Paralympic athlete from the host nation — who lights the Paralympic flame in the stadium 's cauldron .

 The closing ceremony of the Paralympic Games takes place after all sporting events have concluded .

Since the 2002 Winter Paralympics the national flag of the country hosting the next Summer or Winter Paralympic Games is hoisted while the corresponding national anthem is played . The games are officially closed , and the Paralympic flame is extinguished . After these compulsory elements , the next host nation briefly introduces itself with artistic displays of dance and theater representative of its culture .

Volunteering citizens of the host country also act as hosts during the medal ceremonies , as they aid the officials who present the medals and act as flag @-@ bearers . For every Paralympic event , the respective medal ceremony is held , at most , one day after the event 's final .

 In 2001 the International Olympic Committee ( IOC ) and the International Paralympic Committee ( IPC ) signed an agreement which guaranteed that host cities would be contracted to manage both the Olympic and Paralympic Games . This agreement was to remain in effect until the 2012 Summer Olympics , but was extended , encompassing all Summer and Winter games up until the 2020 Summer Olympics . 
 The IOC has written its commitment to equal access to athletics for all people into its charter , which states , 
 While the charter is silent on discrimination specifically related to disability ; given the language in the charter regarding discrimination it is reasonable to infer that discrimination on the basis of disability would be against the ideals of the Olympic Charter and the IOC . This is also consistent with the Paralympic Charter , which forbids discrimination on the basis of political , religious , economic , disability , gender , sexual orientation or racial reasons . 
 Chairman of the London organising committee , Sebastian Coe , said about the 2012 Summer Paralympics and 2012 Summer Olympics in London , England , that 
 The 2014 Winter Paralympic Games is the first such Paralympics hosted by Russia . Russia ratified the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities during that period . Notably at 2010 Vancouver their Paralympic team topped the medal table at the Winter Paralympics , while their Olympic team performed well below expectations at the Winter Olympics . This led the media to highlight the contrast between the achievements of the country 's Olympic and Paralympic delegations , despite the greater attention and funding awarded to the Olympic athletes . The Russian Federation organizers of the 2014 Winter Paralympic Games have , since 2007 , made efforts to make the host city Sochi more accessible .

 Paralympic athletes have sought equal opportunities to compete at the Olympic Games . The precedent was set by <unk> Fairhall , a Paralympic archer from New Zealand , who competed at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles . 
 In 2008 Oscar Pistorius , a South African sprinter , attempted to qualify for the 2008 Summer Olympics . Pistorius had both his legs amputated below the knee and races with two carbon fibre blades manufactured by <unk> . He holds Paralympic world record in the 400 meter event . Pistorius missed qualifying for the 2008 Summer Olympics in the 400 meter race , by 0 @.@ 70 seconds . He qualified for the 2008 Summer Paralympics where he won gold medals in the 100 , 200 , and 400 meter sprints .

 Some athletes without a disability also compete at the Paralympics ; The sighted guides for athletes with a visual impairment are such a close and essential part of the competition that the athlete with visual impairment and the guide are considered a team , and both athletes are medal candidates . 
 = = = = Funding = = = = 
 There has been criticism for not providing equal funding to Paralympic athletes as compared to Olympic athletes . An example of this criticism was a lawsuit filed by Paralympic athletes Tony Iniguez , Scot <unk> and Jacob <unk> of the United States , in 2003 . They alleged that the United States Olympic Committee ( USOC ) , which also include the USOC Paralympic Division ( the National Paralympic Committee ) , was underfunding American Paralympic athletes . Iniguez cited the fact that the USOC made healthcare benefits available to a smaller percentage of Paralympians , the USOC provided smaller quarterly training stipends and paid smaller financial awards for medals won at a Paralympics . US Paralympians saw this as a disadvantage for the US Paralympic athletes , as nations such as Canada and Britain supported Paralympians and Olympians virtually equally . The USOC did not deny the discrepancy in funding and contended that this was due to the fact that it did not receive any government financial support . As a result , it had to rely on revenue generated by the media exposure of its athletes . Olympic athletic success resulted in greater exposure for the USOC than Paralympic athletic achievements . The case was heard by lower courts , who ruled that the USOC has the right to allocate its finances to athletes at different rates . The case was appealed to the Supreme Court , where on September 6 , 2008 it announced that it would not hear the appeal . However , during the time the lawsuit lasted ( from 2003 to 2008 ) , the funding from the USOC had nearly tripled . In 2008 $ 11 @.@ 4 million was earmarked for Paralympic athletes , up from $ 3 million in 2004 . 
 As with the Olympics , recent Paralympics have also been supported by contributions from major sponsors . Unlike the Olympics , where the IOC mandates that arenas be clean of sponsor logos , the Paralympics do allow the logos of official sponsors to be displayed inside arenas and on uniforms . 
 = = = Media coverage = = = 
 While the Olympic Games have experienced tremendous growth in global media coverage since the 1984 Summer Olympics , the Paralympics have been unable to maintain a consistent international media presence . 
 Television broadcasts of Paralympic Games began in 1976 , but this early coverage was confined to taped @-@ delay releases to one nation or region . At the 1992 Summer Paralympics there were 45 hours of live coverage but it was available only in Europe . Other countries broadcast highlight packages during the Games . No meaningful improvements in coverage occurred until the 2000 Summer Paralympics in Sydney . 
 The 2000 Paralympics represented a significant increase in global media exposure for the Paralympic Games . A deal was reached between the Sydney Paralympic Organizing Committee ( <unk> ) and All Media Sports ( AMS ) to broadcast the Games internationally . Deals were reached with Asian , South American , and European broadcast companies to distribute coverage to as many markets as possible . The Games were also webcast for the first time . Because of these efforts the Sydney Paralympics reached a global audience estimated at 300 million people . Also significant was the fact that the organizers did not have to pay networks to televise the Games as had been done at the 1992 and 1996 Games . Despite these advances consistent media attention has been a challenge , which was evidenced in the coverage in Great Britain of the 2010 Winter Paralympics . 
 The British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) was criticized for its minimal coverage of the 2010 Winter Paralympics as compared to its coverage of the 2010 Winter Olympics . The BBC announced it would stream some content on its website and show a one @-@ hour highlight program after the Games ended . For the Winter Olympics the BBC aired 160 hours of coverage . The response from the BBC was that budget constraints and the " time zone factor " necessitated a limited broadcast schedule . The reduction in coverage was done in spite of increased ratings for the 2008 Summer Paralympics , which was watched by 23 % of the population of Great Britain . In Norway , the Norwegian Broadcasting Corporation ( NRK ) broadcast 30 hours of the 2010 Winter Games live . NRK @-@ sport were critical of parts of the TV production from Vancouver , and notified the EBU of issues such as the biathlon coverage excluding the shooting , and cross @-@ country skiing with skiers in the distance , making it hard to follow the progress of the competition . NRK were far more pleased with the production of the ice sledge hockey and wheelchair curling events , which they felt reached the same level as the Olympic Games . 
 Commercial broadcaster Channel 4 acquired the rights to the Paralympics in the United Kingdom for the 2012 Summer Paralympics , and planned to air extensive coverage of the games ; Channel 4 aired 150 hours of coverage , and also offered mobile apps , and three dedicated streaming channels of additional coverage on Sky , Freesat , Virgin Media and Channel 4 's website . " Channel 4 also made a push to heighten the profile of the Paralympics in the country by producing a 2 minute trailer for its coverage , " Meet the Superhumans " ; which premièred simultaneously on over 70 commercial channels in the UK on 17 July 2012 . Channel 4 have also acquired the rights to the 2014 Winter Paralympics and the 2016 Summer Paralympics . 
 American broadcaster NBC Sports , who also owns the broadcast rights to the Olympics , has been criticised by athletes and IPC officials for airing only a bare minimum of coverage from the Paralympics ; the lack of coverage from NBC in Athens was a cause for concern from senior IPC officials , especially given that the United States was bidding for the 2012 Games . In 2012 NBC only produced around 5 hours of tape delayed highlights from the Games , airing on the pay TV channel NBC Sports Network , and did not cover the ceremonies at all . 
 IPC president Philip Craven was vocal about NBC 's reluctance to air coverage in 2012 , expressing his disappointment for American athletes and viewers who would miss the " amazing images " the games would bring , and remarking that " some people think that North America always lead [ s ] on everything , and on this they don 't . It 's about time they caught up . " Following the closing ceremonies , Craven hinted that the IPC might put greater scrutiny on broadcasters at future editions of the Paralympics ( or may strip NBC of its broadcast rights ) , by stating that " if we find our values don ’ t fit , we ’ ll have to go somewhere else . " NBC would pick up broadcast rights to the 2014 and 2016 Paralympics , promising a significantly larger amount of coverage than before .

 = = Classification = = 
 The International Paralympic Committee ( IPC ) has established ten disability categories . Athletes are divided within each category according to their level of impairment , in a functional classification system which differs from sport to sport . 
 = = = Categories = = = 
 The IPC has established ten disability categories , including physical , visual , and intellectual impairment . Athletes with one of these disabilities can compete in the Paralympics though not every sport can allow for every disability category . These categories apply to both Summer and Winter Paralympics . 
 Physical Impairment - There are eight different types of physical impairment : 
 Impaired muscle power - With impairments in this category , the force generated by muscles , such as the muscles of one limb , one side of the body or the lower half of the body is reduced , e.g. due to spinal @-@ cord injury , spina bifida or polio . 
 Impaired passive range of movement - Range of movement in one or more joints is reduced in a systematic way . Acute conditions such as arthritis are not included . 
 Loss of limb or limb deficiency - A total or partial absence of bones or joints from partial or total loss due to illness , trauma , or congenital limb deficiency ( e.g. dysmelia ) . 
 Leg @-@ length difference - Significant bone shortening occurs in one leg due to congenital deficiency or trauma . 
 Short stature - Standing height is reduced due to shortened legs , arms and trunk , which are due to a musculoskeletal deficit of bone or cartilage structures . 
 Hypertonia - Hypertonia is marked by an abnormal increase in muscle tension and reduced ability of a muscle to stretch . Hypertonia may result from injury , disease , or conditions which involve damage to the central nervous system ( e.g. cerebral palsy ) . 
 Ataxia - Ataxia is an impairment that consists of a lack of coordination of muscle movements ( e.g. cerebral palsy , Friedreich ’ s ataxia ) . 
 <unk> - <unk> is generally characterized by unbalanced , involuntary movements and a difficulty maintaining a symmetrical posture ( e.g. cerebral palsy , <unk> ) . 
 Visual Impairment - Athletes with visual impairment ranging from partial vision , sufficient to be judged legally blind , to total blindness . This includes impairment of one or more component of the visual system ( eye structure , receptors , optic nerve pathway , and visual cortex ) . The sighted guides for athletes with a visual impairment are such a close and essential part of the competition that the athlete with visual impairment and the guide are considered a team . Beginning in 2012 , these guides ( along with sighted goalkeepers in 5 @-@ a @-@ side football became eligible to receive medals of their own . 
 Intellectual Disability - Athletes with a significant impairment in intellectual functioning and associated limitations in adaptive behaviour . The IPC primarily serves athletes with physical disabilities , but the disability group Intellectual Disability has been added to some Paralympic Games . This includes only elite athletes with intellectual disabilities diagnosed before the age of 18 . However , the IOC @-@ recognized Special Olympics World Games are open to all people with intellectual disabilities . 
 = = = Classification system = = = 
 Within the disability categories the athletes still need to be divided according to level of impairment . The classification systems differ from sport to sport and are intended to open up sports to as many athletes as possible who can participate in fair competitions against athletes with similar levels of ability . The biggest challenge in the classification system is how to account for the wide variety and severity of disabilities . Consequently , there is a range of impairment within most classifications .

 From its inception until the 1980s , the Paralympic system for classifying athletes consisted of a medical evaluation and diagnosis of impairment . An athlete 's medical condition was the only factor used to determine what class they competed in . For example , an athlete who had a spinal cord injury that resulted in lower limb paresis , would not compete in the same wheelchair race as an athlete with a double above @-@ knee amputation . The fact that their disability caused the same impairment did not factor into classification determination , the only consideration was their medical diagnosis . It was not until views on disabled athletics shifted from just a form of rehabilitation to an end in itself , that the classification system changed from medical diagnosis to a focus on the functional abilities of the athlete . 
 = = = = Functional classification ( since 1980s ) = = = = 
 While there is no clear date when the shift occurred , a functional classification system became the norm for disabled athletic classification in the 1980s . In a functional system the focus is on what effect the athlete 's impairment has on his or her athletic performance . Under this system , athletes with total loss of function in their legs will compete together in most sports , because their functional loss is the same and the reason for the loss is immaterial . The only exception to the functional system is the classification format used by International Blind Sport Federation ( <unk> ) , which still uses a medically based system . 
 Some sports are only held for certain disability types . For example , goalball is only for visually impaired athletes . The Paralympics recognizes three different grades of visual impairment , consequently all competitors in goalball must wear a visor or " black out mask " so that athletes with less visual impairment will not have an advantage . Other sports , like athletics , are open to athletes with a wide variety of impairments . In athletics participants are broken down into a range of classes based on the disability they have and then they are placed in a classification within that range based on their level of impairment . For example : classes 11 – 13 are for visually impaired athletes , which class they are in depends on their level of visual impairment . There are also team competitions such as wheelchair rugby . Members of the team are each given a point value based on their activity limitation . A lower score indicates a more severe activity limitation than a higher score . A team cannot have more than a certain maximum total of points on the field of play at the same time to ensure equal competition . For example , in wheelchair rugby the five players ' combined disability number must total no more than eight points . 
 = = Sports = = 
 There are twenty @-@ two sports on the Summer Paralympic program and five sports on the Winter Paralympics program . Within some of the sports are several events . For example , alpine skiing has downhill , super combined , super @-@ G , slalom , giant slalom . The IPC has governance over several of the sports but not all of them . Other international organizations , known as International Sports Federations ( IF ) , notably the International Wheelchair and Amputee Sports Federation ( IWAS ) , the International Blind Sports Federation ( IBSA ) , and the Cerebral Palsy International Sports and Recreation Association ( CP @-@ ISRA ) , govern some sports that are specific to certain disability groups . There are national chapters for these International Sport Federations including National Paralympic Committees , which are responsible for recruitment of athletes and governance of sports at the national level . 
 = = Controversy = = 
 = = = Cheating = = = 
 After the 2000 Sydney Games , a Spanish basketball player alleged that several members of the gold @-@ medal winning Spanish basketball intellectually disabled ( ID ) team were not disabled . He claimed that only two athletes out of the twelve @-@ member team met the qualifications of an intellectually disabled athlete . A controversy ensued and the IPC called on the Spanish National Paralympic Committee to launch an investigation . The investigation uncovered several Spanish athletes who had flouted the ID rules . In an interview with the president of the federation that oversees ID competition , Fernando Martin Vicente admitted that athletes around the world were breaking the ID eligibility rules . The IPC responded by starting an investigation of its own . The results of the IPC 's investigation confirmed the Spanish athlete 's allegations and also determined that the incident was not isolated to the basketball ID event or to Spanish athletes . As a result , all ID competitions were suspended indefinitely . The ban was lifted after the 2008 Games after work had been done to tighten the criteria and controls governing admission of athletes with intellectual disabilities . Four sports , swimming , athletics , table tennis and rowing , were anticipated to hold competitions for ID athletes at the 2012 Summer Paralympics . 
 The Paralympics have also been tainted by steroid use . At the 2008 Games in Beijing , three <unk> and a German basketball player were banned after having tested positive for banned substances . This was a decrease in comparison to the ten <unk> and one track athlete who were banned from the 2000 Games . German skier Thomas Oelsner became the first Winter Paralympian to test positive for steroids . He had won two gold medals at the 2002 Winter Paralympics , but his medals were stripped after his positive drug test . At the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver , Swedish curler Glenn <unk> tested positive for a banned substance and was suspended for six months by the IPC . He was removed from the rest of the curling competition but his team was allowed to continue . The 54 @-@ year @-@ old curler said his doctor had prescribed a medication on the banned substances list . 
 Another concern now facing Paralympic officials is the technique of " boosting " . Athletes can artificially increase their blood pressure , often by self @-@ harming , which has been shown to improve performance by up to 15 % . This is most effective in the endurance sports such as cross @-@ country skiing . To increase blood pressure athletes will deliberately cause trauma to limbs below a spinal injury . This trauma can include breaking bones , strapping extremities in too tightly , and using high @-@ pressured compression stockings . The injury is painless but it does affect the athlete 's blood pressure . 
 Another potential concern is the use of gene therapy among Paralympic athletes . All Paralympic athletes are banned from enhancing their abilities through gene doping , but it is extremely difficult to differentiate these concepts . The World Anti @-@ Doping Agency is currently researching both gene doping and gene therapy , in part to discern the boundary between the two closely related concepts . 
 The IPC have been working with the World Anti @-@ Doping Agency since 2003 , to ensure compliance with WADA 's anti @-@ doping code among its Paralympic athletes . The IPC has also promised to continue increasing the number of athletes tested at each of its Games , in order to further minimize the possible effect of doping in Paralympic sports . Mandatory in- and out @-@ of competition testing has also been implemented by the IPC to further ensure all of its athletes are performing in compliance with WADA regulations .

 " Speechless " is a song by the American recording artist Michael Jackson , included on his tenth studio album , Invincible ( 2001 ) . It was only released as a promotional single in South Korea . The singer was inspired to write the ballad after a water balloon fight with children in Germany . Jackson collaborated on the production with musicians such as Jeremy Lubbock , Brad Buxer , Novi <unk> , Stuart Bradley and Bruce Swedien . Andraé Crouch and his gospel choir provided backing vocals . 
 Executives at Jackson 's record label , Epic Records , responded positively to the track when given a preview several months before Invincible 's release . " Speechless " was issued as a promotional single , receiving mixed reviews from music critics . Commentary focused on the track 's a <unk> , lyrics and music . A clip of Jackson singing " Speechless " was included in the 2009 documentary @-@ concert film Michael Jackson 's This Is It . 
 = = Writing and recording = = 
 Michael Jackson wrote " Speechless " after a water balloon fight with children in Germany . It took him 45 minutes . In an interview with Vibe magazine , the musician commented , " I was so happy after the fight that I ran upstairs in their house and wrote ' Speechless ' . Fun inspires me . I hate to say that , because it 's such a romantic song . " He added , " But it was the fight that did it . I was happy , and I wrote it in its entirety right there . I felt it would be good enough for the album . Out of the bliss comes magic , wonderment , and creativity . " Jackson would consider " Speechless " to be one of his favorite songs on Invincible . 
 " Speechless " was one of only two songs from Invincible to be written solely by Jackson ( the second song being " The Lost Children " ) . Jeremy Lubbock worked with the musician in arranging and conducting an orchestra . Instrumentalists on the track included Brad Buxer on keyboards , and Novi <unk> and Thomas Tally on violas . The violinists consisted of Peter Kent , Gina Kronstadt , Robin Lorentz , Kirstin Fife and John Wittenberg . The track featured backing vocals from Andraé Crouch and his gospel choir , The Andraé Crouch Singers . " Speechless " was digitally edited by Buxer and Stuart Brawley , and was mixed by Bruce Swedien , who later said , " Everything with Michael is a stand @-@ out moment but an absolutely gorgeous piece of music called ' Speechless ' was really an event . Michael sings the first eight bars a cappella . At the end , he closes it off a cappella – it was Michael 's idea to add the a cappella parts . " 
 = = Composition = = 
 The lyrics to " Speechless " deal with being lost for words because of love . The song opens with Jackson 's singing a cappella : " Your love is magical , that 's how I feel , but I have not the words here to explain " , which Rick de <unk> of The Daytona Beach News @-@ Journal felt the singer " [ <unk> ] sweetly " . The chorus includes the lines , " Speechless , speechless , that 's how you make me feel . Though I 'm with you , I am far away and nothing is for real . " A second a cappella verse bookends the track . 
 " Speechless " is a ballad , and labeled it as " neo @-@ gospel " . According to Musicnotes.com by Alfred Music Publishing . It adds that the track was performed in common time , with a tempo of 80 beats per minute . The song starts in the key of B ♭ major and transitions to C major . After the bridge the song transitions to D Major as a choir starts singing , the last two choruses in E Major , ending with a solo a cappella ending by Jackson . The song 's vocal range is from F4 to B5 .

 In June 2001 , several months before the release of Invincible , " Speechless " was among several songs showcased from the album exclusively to executives of Jackson 's music label , Epic Records ( a subsidiary of Sony Music Entertainment ) . Other songs previewed included " Unbreakable " , " The Lost Children " , " Whatever Happens " , " Break of Dawn " , " Heaven Can Wait " and " Privacy " , all of which featured on Invincible 's track listing . Roger Friedman of Fox News reported that the executives who listened to the previews liked what they heard . Epic Records ' president , Dave <unk> , said of the tracks , " It 's wonderful and amazing . Michael is singing better than ever . " He added , " The ballads ! The ballads are beautiful , and they 're all there . " " Speechless " was later released as a promotional single in 2001 . A remixed version of " You Rock My World " , featuring rapper Jay @-@ Z , served as the single 's B @-@ side .

 = = Critical reception = = 
 " Speechless " received a mixed reaction from music journalists . Craig Seymour of The Buffalo News felt that the song was the only one from the album in which Jackson successfully revisited his past . The journalist said the song was reminiscent of the 1995 chart @-@ topper " You Are Not Alone " , as it sounded to him like a track that could have been written by R. Kelly , who penned the number one hit . Writing for the Chicago Sun @-@ Times , Jim DeRogatis described " Speechless " as a " beautifully minimal , heartfelt romantic ballad " . Music journalist Roger Catlin stated that the song leaned toward " neo @-@ gospel " . The New York Post said that " Speechless " was " lullaby @-@ like " and the best song on Invincible , and Jon Pareles of The New York Times praised Jackson 's " long lines and creamy overdubbed choruses [ sailing ] weightlessly " in the ballad , that the journalist felt it was a love song to God . 
 Pop music critic Robert Hilburn described " Speechless " , and another song from Invincible ( " Butterflies " ) , as being " as woefully generic as their titles " . Ben Rayner of the Toronto Star contested that the a <unk> in " Speechless " were enough to make a person wish that Jackson actually was unable to make a sound . Michigan Daily writer Dustin J. Seibert wrote that the song was a " shining [ example ] of what happens when The Gloved One gets beside himself and writes smarmy crap that should be reserved for a CD changer somewhere in a preschool " . The Fort Worth Star @-@ Telegram said that " Speechless " was one of the weaker tracks from Invincible . Elliot Sylvester of The Independent felt that the song was " pure Jackson – almost to a formulaic fault " . The Dallas Morning News ' Thor Christensen said that " Speechless " was " produced by Mr. Jackson in bombastic style à la Celine Dion " . He added that as the track ended with an emotional Jackson , it drew a parallel with the singer 's 1972 ode to a rat , " Ben " . 
 Vaughn Watson of The Providence Journal hailed " Speechless " as Invincible 's " best song , and one of Jackson 's finest of any album " . He added that with the song , the musician acknowledged the pain that accompanies isolation . In a review of Invincible , The Wichita Eagle stated that " Speechless " , " Don 't Walk Away " and " Cry " were among the " sincere ballads " in which Jackson was exemplary . Ada Anderson of The Ball State Daily News expressed the view that " Speechless " would become a popular song , and writers for the South Florida Sun @-@ Sentinel stated that the ballad would take time to get used to . The Dayton Daily News ' Ron Rollins described the track as a " pretty love song " . Music critic Kevin C. Johnson thought that " Speechless " was " one of [ Jackson 's ] typical , whispery ballads that swells as it moves along " . A journalist for The Olympian stated that the song was " gorgeous " .

 = North American XB @-@ 21 = 
 The North American XB @-@ 21 , also known by the manufacturer 's model designation NA @-@ 21 , and sometimes referred to by the name " Dragon " , was a prototype bomber aircraft developed by North American Aviation in the late 1930s , for evaluation by the United States Army Air Corps . Evaluated against the Douglas B @-@ 18 Bolo , it was found to be considerably more expensive than the rival aircraft , and despite the ordering of a small number of evaluation aircraft , only the prototype was ever built . 
 = = Design and development = = 
 North American Aviation 's first twin @-@ engined military aircraft , the NA @-@ 21 prototype was constructed at North American 's factory in Inglewood , California , where work on the aircraft began in early 1936 . The NA @-@ 21 was a mid @-@ wing monoplane of all @-@ metal construction , powered by two Pratt & Whitney R @-@ 2180 @-@ A Twin Hornet radial engines , which were fitted with <unk> for increased high @-@ altitude performance . 
 Flown by a crew of six to eight men , the XB @-@ 21 featured a remarkably strong defensive armament for the time , including as many as five .30 @-@ calibre M1919 machine guns . These were planned to be fitted in hydraulically powered nose and dorsal turrets , in addition to manually operated weapons installed in waist and ventral positions . Up to 10 @,@ 000 pounds ( 4 @,@ 500 kg ) of bombs could be carried in an internal bomb bay , with 2 @,@ 200 pounds ( 1 @,@ 000 kg ) of bombs being able to be carried over a range of 1 @,@ 900 miles ( 3 @,@ 100 km ) . 
 = = Testing and evaluation = = 
 Undertaking its maiden flight on 22 December 1936 at Mines Field , company test flying indicated a number of minor problems . Modifications resolving these resulted in the aircraft being re @-@ designated NA @-@ 39 , and , accepted by the U.S. Army Air Corps as the XB @-@ 21 . The aircraft , which had been assigned the serial number 38 @-@ 485 , was evaluated early the following year in competition against a similar design by Douglas Aircraft , an improved version of the company 's successful B @-@ 18 Bolo . 
 During the course of the fly @-@ off , the gun turrets proved troublesome , their drive motors proving to be underpowered , and issues with wind blast through the gun slots were also encountered . As a result of these problems , the XB @-@ 21 's nose turret was faired over , while the dorsal turret was removed . 
 The XB @-@ 21 proved to have superior performance over its competitor , but price became the primary factor distinguishing the Bolo and the XB @-@ 21 . On this account , the modified B @-@ 18 was declared the winner of the competition , Douglas quoting a price per aircraft of $ 64 @,@ 000 USD , while North American 's estimate was $ 122 @,@ 000 USD per aircraft , and an order was placed for 177 of the Douglas aircraft , to be designated B @-@ 18A . 
 Despite this , the Army Air Corps found the performance of the XB @-@ 21 to have been favorable enough to order five pre @-@ production aircraft , to be designated YB @-@ 21 . However , soon after this contract was awarded , it was cancelled , and none of the YB @-@ 21s were ever built , leaving the XB @-@ 21 as the sole example of the type ever constructed . Operated by North American Aviation , the XB @-@ 21 served as a research aircraft until its retirement . 
 Although the XB @-@ 21 failed to win a production contract , it was the first of a long line of North American Aviation medium bomber aircraft , and provided experience and knowledge that assisted in the development of the North American NA @-@ 40 , which , developed into the B @-@ 25 Mitchell , would become one of the Army 's standard medium bombers of World War II .

 Her acting and modeling career has included appearances in a variety of media , including films , television programs and advertisements , theatrical productions , and print advertisements . <unk> made her first film appearance in the 1964 short film The Legend of Jimmy Blue Eyes . She adopted the stage name Janee Michelle because her talent agent and the film studio both believed her birth name would be poorly received . Michelle 's acting in the television series The Outcasts in 1968 was critically acclaimed , which led to several offers of film roles . Both in a 1969 episode of The Governor & J.J. and in the 1970 film Soul Soldier , Michelle acted alongside her then @-@ husband Robert DoQui . 
 In 1977 , Michelle was the queen in the New Orleans Mardi Gras Zulu parade . She was the first Zulu queen to wear two different gowns , both of which were designed by Bob Mackie , who had designed outfits for Cher . She divorced DoQui in 1978 and married New Orleans politician Robert H. Tucker , Jr. the following year ; she changed her name to Gee Tucker and became a businessperson . 
 In 1980 , the couple founded Tucker and Associates , a management consulting company that , in 1990 , received a US $ 26 million contract with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve , representing the largest contract that had ever been received by a minority @-@ owned company in Louisiana . While working on this contract , Michelle and Tucker started a second company called Integrated Logistical Support . The couple divorced and Michelle retained ownership of Tucker and Associates while Tucker retained ownership of Integrated Logistical Support . When Tucker retired in 2008 , the couple 's daughter Iam Tucker replaced him as president of Integrated Logistical Support . After Hurricane Katrina struck New Orleans , Michelle purchased Sophie 's Gelato , an ice cream parlor on Magazine Street where she makes gelato in @-@ house .

 Janee Michelle was born Geneva Leona Mercadel in New Orleans , Louisiana . Her paternal great @-@ grandfather was a shoemaker who immigrated to New York from Champagne , France before moving to New Orleans in pursuit of a warmer climate . Michelle 's extended family was large and had lived in the 7th Ward of New Orleans for many years . Michelle is related to Sidney Barthelemy , former Mayor of New Orleans . 
 Traditionally , the <unk> had worked in construction , and some of Michelle 's cousins continued this tradition . Michelle 's mother 's surname was Mathieu and her family background included people from Africa , France , Germany , and Italy , as well as Choctaw people . Michelle grew up in a religious home in which her father , Walter F. Mercadel , was a barber and her mother was a beautician . She had three siblings : an older brother named <unk> and two younger sisters named <unk> and Zona . 
 At age 13 , Michelle created , produced , designed , and directed a dance show at the YWCA in New Orleans . She was named Miss New Orleans in 1960 . She attended Rivers Frederick Junior High School where her principal , Leah McKenna , encouraged her to pursue a career in entertainment . While in high school , Michelle won fifteen certificates and medals for language proficiency . She started high school in New Orleans and then transferred to Manual Arts High School in Los Angeles , California , when her family moved there as a result of her mother 's illness , which was aggravated by the high humidity of New Orleans . Her father was unemployed at the time and her brother 's wife was pregnant , so she started working as a cook to support the family . She graduated from Manual Arts ranked 25th scholastically in her 500 @-@ student class , and then attended Los Angeles City College and Woodbury College , receiving her best grades in English studies . She took drama courses from Actors Studio West and the Columbia Film Workshop .

 Michelle 's acting , modeling , and dancing career has included appearances in a variety of media , including films , television programs and advertisements , theatrical productions , and print advertisements . She commuted to a job as a dancer in Las Vegas while she was still in high school . She has learned to perform both ballet and Cuban dance styles and has danced at the Hollywood Palladium and Tropicana Las Vegas . As a stage actor , she appeared in productions of <unk> ! , The Death of Daddy Hugs and Kisses , Ride a Wild Horse , The Vagina Monologues , In the Blink of an Eye , and other plays . One of her early television advertisement appearances was for Ultra Sheen hair products . In 1964 , Michelle — still known by her birth name Geneva Mercadel — received her first film role in the short film The Legend of Jimmy Blue Eyes , which was nominated for an Academy Award . Her contract did not allow her to receive residuals when the film later aired on television . Her talent agent and the film studio both believed her birth name would be received poorly , so she adopted the stage name Janee Michelle . She chose the name Janee ( pronounced Ja @-@ Nay , and sometimes spelled <unk> ) to keep the first two syllables of her birth name . She chose the surname Michelle because she " thought it would be unique to have a name with two first names " . When she found people had difficulty pronouncing the name Janee , she considered changing it again , but decided against it because she believed this pronunciation difficulty caused people to remember her . 
 In 1967 , an article in The Chicago Defender predicted that Michelle 's career in American cinema would be successful . Also that year , she appeared on the cover of an issue of the magazine Jet alongside Ronnie Eckstine in recognition of their appearance together in Eckstine 's debut film The Love @-@ Ins ; it was Michelle 's most prominent film role until that point . A Variety reviewer wrote that Michelle was cast well in the role . Michelle 's acting in the television series The Outcasts was critically acclaimed , leading to several offers of film roles . The Outcasts reviews also led to her appearance in an episode of Love , American Style alongside Greg Morris , known for his role in the Mission : Impossible television series . 
 Michelle was included in the magazine Ebony 's list of Fifty Eligible Girls for 1969 . Also in 1969 , Michelle again appeared on the cover of Jet , which called her " one of Hollywood 's most attractive actresses " . The article declares Michelle to be one of several up @-@ and @-@ coming African @-@ American actresses , along with Gloria Foster , Gail Fisher , and Denise Nicholas . In the corresponding interview with Jet , Michelle said although racial inequality in the United States may have been a career obstacle for African @-@ American women in the past , " that 's not it today — and that 's for sure " . Michelle argued that her success as an actor proved the falsehood of the idea that African @-@ American women need to have sexual intercourse with certain people to become successful in the cinema of the United States . 
 Michelle starred alongside her husband Robert DoQui in a 1969 episode of The Governor & J.J. The couple acted together again the following year in Soul Soldier , a film in which Michelle is the leading lady ; she appears with DoQui in nude sex scenes . Michelle 's and DoQui 's characters form a love triangle with Lincoln Kilpatrick 's character . In a New York Times review of the film , Howard Thompson called all three actors ' performances " plain painful " . 
 In 1973 , Michelle collaborated with actors Judy Pace and Lillian Lehman to found Kwanza , a Hollywood , California @-@ based nonprofit organization named after the African diaspora celebration Kwanzaa . Run entirely by African American actresses on a volunteer basis , Kwanza initially provided food to people in need at Christmas . Michelle and the other two co @-@ founders each enlisted five other African American actresses to volunteer with the organization and , together , they raised enough funds to provide food to 75 families that first Christmas . By 1976 , the organization had fed more than 2000 individuals and had expanded to function year @-@ round . 
 Michelle is best known for her role in the 1974 horror film The House on Skull Mountain , which was once an obscure film but became better known when it was released on DVD . She portrays Lorena Christophe , who is summoned to the house of a recently @-@ dead distant relative who was a voodoo queen . Christophe is the love interest of the main character , who is portrayed by Victor French . In the Encyclopedia of African American Actresses in Film and Television , Bob McCann writes that Michelle " is quite pretty and gives a charming performance in her undemanding role " . A Variety reviewer provided a similar appraisal of Michelle 's appearance , calling her attractive and her role chic . In 2014 , she appeared in a health insurance television advertisement for AARP .

 In 1977 , Michelle 's cousin , Anthony " Chuck " Mercadel , was chosen to be that year 's king of the Zulu parade , part of New Orleans Mardi Gras . He and Michelle had not seen each other since before her film and television career when she was living in New Orleans . Michelle was volunteering with Kwanza in Shreveport , Louisiana with 25 other actresses , including Isabel Sanford , when Chuck and New Orleans politician Robert H. Tucker , Jr. visited Michelle at her hotel . Chuck said he was looking for Sanford so he could ask her to be his queen . Michelle asked him , " Why don 't you ask me to be your queen ? " , and he did so . Michelle refused the offer because she did not wish to be his second choice . Sanford was unable to appear in the parade due to a prior engagement and Chuck asked Michelle again . This time , she accepted , despite having to rearrange her schedule . 
 Until the time of the parade , Michelle was working in Hollywood . She flew to New Orleans to be ceremoniously greeted at the airport by a band and some Zulu Social Aid & Pleasure Club members . Michelle was the first Zulu queen to wear two different gowns : one for the parade and the other for the ball . Bob Mackie designed both of these gowns . Mackie had designed outfits for Cher , from whom Michelle borrowed a beige turkey feather boa and headdress for the parade . Michelle 's parade gown was sleeveless , had a turtleneck , and was composed of a gold @-@ and @-@ cinnamon brocade decorated with topaz gemstones . The ball gown was a white , form @-@ fitting garment with a see @-@ through front , and was decorated with crystals and white bugle beads . She rejected the traditional tiara and instead wore a headpiece covered in pearls . Of her promenade around the ballroom , during which she swayed her shoulders and hips , Michelle later said " high @-@ school girls were imitating it for a year after that : the ' Zulu queen ' walk " .

 After divorcing DoQui in 1978 , Michelle married Robert H. Tucker , Jr. the following year , changed her name to Gee Tucker , moved back to New Orleans , and became a businessperson . After Tucker had repeatedly been unsuccessful in being elected to public office , he convinced Michelle to go into business with him and stop working for Copeland . In 1980 , Tucker and Michelle founded Tucker and Associates , a management consulting company . The company did not generate much revenue at first , and Michelle worked elsewhere in management and marketing . For the first few years , Michelle and Tucker did not apply for assistance from the Small Business Administration ( SBA ) 8 ( a ) Business Development Program , which offers support to businesses run by members of minority groups . Michelle said they made this decision because " we had seen other businesses start out strongly , graduate from the SBA 8 @-@ A program and fail [ and ] we wanted to be able to know that we could compete without it " . Michelle had no formal business education , which made her feel inadequate as an entrepreneur . Of these early years in business , she later said , " I learned the hard way , on the job , things I could never have learned in school . But I think the formal training in school would have made it easier . " 
 Eventually , Tucker and Associates began receiving contracts requiring a variety of services , including personnel , data processing , finance , and marketing . By 1990 , the company employed 225 people and had a revenue of approximately $ 11 million . That year , the company received a $ 26 million contract with the Strategic Petroleum Reserve , representing the largest contract that had ever been received by a minority @-@ owned company in Louisiana . This contract was awarded through the SBA 8 ( a ) program and lasted seven years . While working on this contract , Michelle and Tucker started a second company called Integrated Logistical Support , of which Michelle became the vice president . The couple divorced before the Strategic Petroleum Reserve contract ended , and Michelle went back to using her maiden name . Michelle retained ownership of Tucker and Associates , remaining its president and chief executive officer , while Tucker retained ownership of Integrated Logistical Support . 
 Michelle was a director of Hibernia National Bank while it was a Forbes 500 company , and as of 2002 , she is the chief operating officer of Tucker and Associates . In 2003 , Ray Nagin , Mayor of New Orleans , ended contracts with eleven companies that had ties to the previous mayor , Marc Morial ; both Tucker and Associates and Integrated Logistical Support were among these companies . Michelle has sat on the board of the Louisiana Children 's Museum and has volunteered with the Drugs Off the Street program . 
 Michelle purchased Sophie 's Gelato in New Orleans , which she operates .

 In 1991 , Michelle was recognized as a YWCA Role Model . The National Council of Negro Women named her one of five community leaders of the year in 1995 . Michelle has been named New Orleans Woman Business Owner of the Year and has received the Best of Black Business Award . The Business and Professional Women 's Foundation has named her Employer of the Year . The American Council for Career Women has granted her their Achiever 's Award .

 On July 22 , 1966 , at the age of twenty , Michelle married 33 @-@ year @-@ old Albert S. Hubbard in Marin County , California . They divorced in January 1968 . On April 25 of the following year , she married 35 @-@ year @-@ old Robert DoQui in San Francisco . DoQui , whose term of endearment for Michelle was " crazy Creole chick " , already had four children from a previous marriage to a woman who had died , and Michelle developed a relationship with these children , who were aged five , six , eight , and eleven . In a 1969 interview with the magazine Tan , Michelle indicated that DoQui 's fashion preferences were an important factor in her clothing purchase decisions , saying , " I think a girl should dress for her husband " . She also expressed her support for the breadwinner model in which men are expected to make the most income for their families and women are expected to be housewives , although Michelle argued that women should work outside the home if they want to . She went on to say that women no longer worked hard enough to retain the respect and love of their husbands , and the interviewer describes Michelle as following her own advice : " She dotes so much on her man , invests so much of herself in him , his well @-@ being " . Michelle gave birth to a son , Robert <unk> DoQui , in 1971 , and he later became an actor and writer . Michelle and DoQui divorced in June 1978 . 
 Having met Robert Tucker when her cousin Chuck asked her to appear in the 1977 Zulu parade , Michelle eventually started dating Tucker and they married in 1979 . Their daughter , Iam Christian Tucker , in 1983 . Michelle and Tucker divorced after nineteen years of marriage .

 = Interstate 95 in Delaware = 
 Interstate 95 ( I @-@ 95 ) is an Interstate highway running along the East Coast of the United States from Miami , Florida north to the Canadian border in Houlton , Maine . In the state of Delaware , the route runs for 23 @.@ 43 mi ( 37 @.@ 71 km ) across the Wilmington area in northern New Castle County from the Maryland state line near Newark northeast to the Pennsylvania state line in Claymont . I @-@ 95 is the only primary ( 2 @-@ digit ) Interstate highway that enters Delaware , although it also has two auxiliary routes within the state ( I @-@ 295 and I @-@ 495 ) . Between the Maryland border and Newport , I @-@ 95 follows the Delaware Turnpike or John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway , a toll road with a toll plaza near the state line . In Newport , the interstate has a large interchange with Delaware Route 141 ( DE 141 ) and the southern termini of I @-@ 295 and I @-@ 495 , the latter interstate providing a bypass of Wilmington . I @-@ 95 heads north through the heart of Wilmington concurrent with U.S. Route 202 ( US 202 ) on the Wilmington Expressway . Past Wilmington , I @-@ 95 continues northeast to Claymont , where I @-@ 495 rejoins the route right before the Pennsylvania state line . 
 Plans for a road along the I @-@ 95 corridor through Wilmington to the Pennsylvania border predate the Interstate Highway System . After the Delaware Memorial Bridge was built in 1951 , the Delaware Turnpike was proposed between the bridge approach in Farnhurst and the Maryland border near Newark in order to alleviate traffic congestion on parallel US 40 . With the creation of the Interstate Highway System in 1956 , both these roads were incorporated into I @-@ 95 . Construction on the Delaware Turnpike began in 1957 and ended in 1963 . Construction on building I @-@ 95 through Wilmington began in the early 1960s . I @-@ 95 was completed north from Newport to downtown Wilmington in 1966 and north to the Pennsylvania border in 1968 . Between 1978 and 1980 , I @-@ 95 was temporarily rerouted along the I @-@ 495 bypass route while the South Wilmington Viaduct was reconstructed ; during this time the route through Wilmington was designated as I @-@ 895 . Improvements continue to be made to the highway including widening projects and reconstruction of sections of the road and interchanges .

 = = = Delaware Turnpike = = = 
 I @-@ 95 enters Delaware from Maryland southwest of Newark in New Castle County . From the state line , the highway heads east as the six @-@ lane Delaware Turnpike ( John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway ) through wooded areas . Not far from the Maryland border , the road comes to a toll plaza . I @-@ 95 widens to eight lanes and comes to a modified cloverleaf interchange with DE 896 , which heads north to Newark and the University of Delaware and south to US 301 . Following this interchange , the interstate highway runs between industrial areas to the north and farm fields to the south , coming to bridges over Norfolk Southern 's Delmarva Secondary railroad line and DE 72 . The road heads through more woodland with nearby suburban development as it curves northeast , with the median widening for the Delaware Welcome Center service plaza accessible from both directions . A short distance later , I @-@ 95 reaches the DE 273 interchange west of Christiana . The freeway continues northeast and comes to a modified cloverleaf interchange with the DE 1 / DE 7 freeway to the northwest of the Christiana Mall . This interchange has flyover ramps between southbound I @-@ 95 and southbound DE 1 / DE 7 and northbound DE 1 / DE 7 and northbound I @-@ 95 ; the northbound ramp splits onto both sides of the northbound lanes of I @-@ 95 . 
 Past this interchange , I @-@ 95 widens to ten lanes and passes under DE 58 , with a ramp from southbound I @-@ 95 to westbound DE 58 that provides the missing connection between southbound I @-@ 95 and northbound DE 7 . The highway continues through woods before passing through Churchman 's Marsh , where it crosses the Christina River . After this bridge , I @-@ 95 has a northbound ramp to Airport Road that serves to provide access to southbound US 202 / DE 141 . At this point , the lanes of the interstate split further apart and the northbound ramp for I @-@ 295 and northbound DE 141 splits off to parallel the northbound lanes of I @-@ 95 . The ramp to northbound I @-@ 295 has two lanes while northbound I @-@ 95 carries four lanes . After this , I @-@ 95 crosses US 202 / DE 141 , at which point US 202 becomes concurrent with the interstate . Upon crossing DE 141 , the ramp to northbound DE 141 from the northbound I @-@ 295 ramp splits off while the ramp from DE 141 to northbound I @-@ 95 merges in from the left . Southbound , a collector / distributor ramp serves to provide access between I @-@ 95 and DE 141 . Not far after encountering DE 141 , I @-@ 295 splits off to the southeast , with the northbound entrance from I @-@ 295 and the southbound exit to I @-@ 295 and southbound entrance from I @-@ 295 on the left side of the road . At this point , the Delaware Turnpike splits from I @-@ 95 and follows I @-@ 295 southeast to an interchange with US 13 / US 40 in Farnhurst , where the turnpike ends and I @-@ 295 continues east as the Delaware Memorial Bridge approach . After I @-@ 295 , I @-@ 95 / US 202 turns north and comes to a northbound exit and southbound entrance with the southern terminus of I @-@ 495 , which bypasses Wilmington to the east . 
 = = = Wilmington Expressway = = = 
 Following the I @-@ 495 interchange , the median narrows and I @-@ 95 / US 202 heads northeast through marshland as the six @-@ lane Wilmington Expressway , crossing the Christina River . The freeway comes to a bridge over Norfolk Southern 's Shellpot Branch and continues through more wetlands , with Amtrak 's Northeast Corridor running a short distance to the northwest . The road heads into Wilmington and curves to the north , passing to the west of Frawley Stadium , home of the Wilmington Blue Rocks baseball team . I @-@ 95 / US 202 heads towards downtown Wilmington and crosses onto a viaduct , passing over the Northeast Corridor and coming to an interchange that provides access to the downtown area by way of DE 4 and DE 48 . At this point , the four @-@ lane freeway continues northeast , with one @-@ way northbound North Adams Street to the east and one @-@ way southbound North Jackson Street to the west serving as frontage roads . I @-@ 95 / US 202 continues through residential areas to the west of downtown Wilmington , passing over DE 9 , with a southbound exit . Farther northeast , the freeway heads into an alignment below street level and comes to an interchange with DE 52 . Past this interchange , the road heads to the north and crosses Brandywine Creek , heading through Brandywine Park , which is a part of the Wilmington State Parks complex . The freeway curves northeast again and passes under CSX 's Philadelphia Subdivision before reaching an interchange with the northern terminus of DE 202 at the northern edge of Wilmington , at which point US 202 splits from I @-@ 95 . 
 Past US 202 , I @-@ 95 leaves Wilmington for the suburban Brandywine Hundred area and heads northeast as a four @-@ lane road , passing southeast of the Rock Manor Golf Club and running along the northwest side of the CSX line . The freeway curves east to pass over the railroad tracks and continues through wooded areas to the south of the CSX tracks , coming to a diamond interchange with DE 3 near Bellefonte . After this exit , I @-@ 95 and the rail line curve to the northeast and continue through woodland with nearby residential areas , passing northwest of Bellevue State Park . The highway comes to a northbound exit and southbound entrance with Harvey Road near the villages of Arden , <unk> , and <unk> . Past this interchange , the freeway curves east away from the CSX tracks and winds northeast near suburban neighborhoods in Claymont . In Claymont , the interstate comes to a diamond interchange with DE 92 , at which point I @-@ 495 also merges onto the northbound direction of the interstate . Following the interchange , I @-@ 95 passes to the west of the Tri @-@ State Mall before it crosses the state line into Pennsylvania . The southbound exit from I @-@ 95 to I @-@ 495 is located in Pennsylvania 132 feet ( 40 m ) before the Delaware state line . 
 I @-@ 95 in Delaware has an annual average daily traffic count ranging from a high of 169 @,@ 865 vehicles at the DE 1 / DE 7 interchange in Christiana to a low of 48 @,@ 906 vehicles at the DE 92 interchange in Claymont . As part of the Interstate Highway System , the entire length of I @-@ 95 in Delaware is a part of the National Highway System . 
 = = Tolls = = 
 I @-@ 95 has a toll plaza along the Delaware Turnpike near the Maryland border in Newark that charges $ 4 @.@ 00 for cars . Cash or E @-@ ZPass is accepted for payment of tolls . 
 When the highway first opened in 1963 , the toll at the state line was 30 cents . Prior to 1976 , ramp tolls were collected at the DE 896 , DE 273 , and DE 7 interchanges . The ramp tolls required exact change , and many motorists were caught by police evading the tolls because they did not have the proper change . In 1970 , an attempt was made to use the honor system for motorists without the proper change at the tollbooth to pay the tolls by mailing them . However , it was discontinued after a month because most motorists did not mail in their tolls . In 1976 , Governor Sherman W. <unk> signed House Bill 1278 , which was sponsored by Representative Gerard A. Cain . This bill called for the elimination of the three ramp tolls while keeping the mainline toll plaza near the Maryland border . The ramp tolls stopped being collected on October 1 , 1976 . 
 In 1981 , plans were announced to demolish the former toll booths at the DE 273 and DE 7 interchanges ; however , the DE 896 interchange toll booths were to remain to collect tolls from trucks . The mainline toll plaza was planned to be closed on July 1 , 1981 after the bonds to construct the road were paid off , but was kept by " Operation Overhaul " , a $ 93 million project by Governor Pierre S. du Pont IV that would use the tolls collected at the toll plaza to fund improvements to the turnpike along with other roads in the state of Delaware . In the summer of 2011 , reconstruction of the Delaware Turnpike toll plaza was completed in a $ 32 @.@ 6 million project , adding high @-@ speed E @-@ ZPass lanes . As of 2011 , the Delaware Turnpike was the third most expensive toll road in the United States based on a cost @-@ per @-@ mile average , at a rate of 23 cents per mile ( 14 ¢ / km ) . 
 = = Services = = 
 The Delaware Welcome Center service plaza is located in the median of I @-@ 95 between the DE 896 and DE 273 interchanges east of Newark . The service plaza offers a Sunoco gas station , a convenience store , multiple fast @-@ food restaurants , a Delaware Visitor Center offering tourist information , and retail options including a store called Postcards from Delaware that sells Delaware @-@ related merchandise . The Delaware Welcome Center is run by HMSHost . 
 When the Delaware Turnpike opened in 1963 , a Hot Shoppes restaurant and an Esso service station was located along the road in the median . In 1964 , a proposal was made to build a truck stop and motel next to the existing facilities . The truck stop proposal was off and on for several years until a truck stop was built just over the border in Maryland in 1975 . In 1983 , Hot Shoppes was replaced by Roy Rogers and Bob 's Big Boy in order to offer both sit @-@ down dining and fast food . This was the largest Roy Rogers and Bob 's Big Boy location at the time and restaurant namesake Roy Rogers and Lieutenant Governor Michael Castle were in attendance for the opening . In September 2009 , the Delaware Welcome Center was closed for a reconstruction project that would construct a new service plaza building , new gas pumps , new truck parking , and an improved visitor center . The renovated service plaza opened in June 2010 at a cost of $ 35 million .

 In 1948 , the Wilmington Transportation Study proposed two new roads running between the southern end of Wilmington and the Pennsylvania border to improve traffic flow in the Wilmington area . Route A followed the current alignment of I @-@ 95 while Route B bypassed the city to the east along the current alignment of I @-@ 495 . Plans for building Route A were made in 1950 but were deferred a year later due to opposition . 
 Following the completion of the Delaware Memorial Bridge and the connecting New Jersey Turnpike in 1951 , through traffic coming from the bridge led to significant congestion on US 13 and US 40 . As a result of this , suggestions were made in 1954 for a limited @-@ access road to be constructed leading to the bridge that would alleviate congestion on US 40 . In 1956 , the Interstate Highway System was created , with two routes proposed along the current alignment of I @-@ 95 . FAI @-@ 1 was proposed to run from the Maryland state line east to an interchange west of Farnhurst while FAI @-@ 2 was proposed between this interchange and the Pennsylvania border through the western part of Wilmington . The corridor following FAI @-@ 1 and FAI @-@ 2 would become designated as part of I @-@ 95 , an Interstate Highway running along the East Coast of the United States . FAI @-@ 1 was originally planned as a free Interstate Highway using federal funds ; however , the road would not have been completed until 1967 under this plan . As a result , the state of Delaware financed the road with bond issues and would build it as a toll road called the Delaware Turnpike . 
 The first construction contracts for the Delaware Turnpike were awarded in 1957 , with construction soon following that year . Construction began on building a new bridge over US 13 / US 40 at the Farnhurst interchange in 1958 that would connect the Delaware Turnpike to the I @-@ 295 / US 40 approach to the Delaware Memorial Bridge . The same year , plans were made for several bridges along I @-@ 95 . In 1959 , work began on rebuilding the Farnhurst interchange to Interstate Highway standards . The same year , recommendations were made for the design and right @-@ of @-@ way acquisition along the planned route of I @-@ 95 as well as the construction of several contracts between the Maryland border and Farnhurst along the Delaware Turnpike , including the interchange with DE 41 / DE 141 and between I @-@ 95 , I @-@ 295 , and I @-@ 495 near the Christina River . The proposed routing for I @-@ 95 through Wilmington would take it through the central core between Adams and Jackson streets . Locals tried to fight routing I @-@ 95 through the central core and instead suggested routing it along Bancroft Parkway to the west or the present @-@ day route of I @-@ 495 to the east . However , the lame @-@ duck Republican @-@ controlled city council approved routing I @-@ 95 along Adams and Jackson streets in 1957 . The demolition of homes began in January 1959 . 
 A year later , construction began on overpasses and ramps at the Farnhurst interchange . The same year , suggestions were made to build I @-@ 95 across the Christina Marsh as well as construct the bridges over the Christina River and the Pennsylvania Railroad in Wilmington . A contract was awarded for the Christina River interchange in 1961 . By 1961 , all construction contracts along the Delaware Turnpike had been completed except for the DE 41 / DE 141 interchange and the Christina River interchange . In 1962 , the I @-@ 95 bridges over the Christina River , the Pennsylvania Railroad , and Little Mill Creek were finished while plans were made for the South Wilmington Viaduct that would cross over several railroad tracks belonging to the Pennsylvania Railroad , Baltimore and Ohio Railroad , and the Reading Railroad . The same year , the roadway was built between the Christina River interchange and the South Wilmington Viaduct . The new northbound lanes of DE 41 / DE 141 through the I @-@ 95 interchange opened in November 1962 . The southbound lanes of DE 41 / DE 141 opened in June 1964 , enabling directional flow of DE 41 / DE 141 through the interchange . In September 1963 , construction work on the turnpike was halted by picketing workers . 
 The Delaware Turnpike , along with the connecting Northeast Expressway in Maryland , was dedicated by President John F. Kennedy , Delaware Governor Elbert N. Carvel , and Maryland Governor J. Millard Tawes in a ribbon @-@ cutting ceremony at the state line on November 14 , 1963 . The Delaware Turnpike was opened to traffic at midnight on November 15 , 1963 . The first motorist to pay a toll on the turnpike was <unk> C. <unk> , also known as " Mr. First " , of Teaneck , New Jersey , who marked this occasion as the 517th first moment he achieved . The completion of the Delaware Turnpike allowed motorists to travel from Washington , D.C. to Boston without having to stop at a traffic light . Construction of the Delaware Turnpike cost $ 30 million . Following the opening of the turnpike , traffic levels on US 40 and US 301 fell by 40 to 50 percent . The rerouting of traffic to the Delaware Turnpike led to the reduction in profits for businesses along US 13 and US 40 , with several businesses forced to close . Meanwhile , the Delaware Turnpike saw more traffic volume than originally projected . Eight days after dedicating the toll road , President Kennedy was assassinated in Dallas . As a result , both the Delaware Turnpike and the Northeast Expressway were renamed the John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway in his honor in December 1963 . On the one year anniversary of the dedication of the Delaware Turnpike on November 14 , 1964 , a memorial service and wreath laying in honor of Kennedy was held at the state line , with Governor Carvel in attendance . 
 The remainder of I @-@ 95 between the Christina River interchange and the Pennsylvania border would be built as a non @-@ tolled freeway . In April 1964 , construction contracts were awarded for bridges at the Christina River interchange that would carry I @-@ 95 and I @-@ 495 traffic over I @-@ 295 . In late spring of 1964 , construction on the South Wilmington Viaduct began . In June of that year , the substructure of the I @-@ 95 bridge over the Brandywine Creek was completed . In August 1964 , construction began on the I @-@ 95 interchange with Naamans Road and the northern terminus of I @-@ 495 in Claymont . In 1965 , construction was underway to build the below @-@ surface alignment of I @-@ 95 between Fourth Street and the Brandywine Creek in Wilmington . The construction of I @-@ 95 through Wilmington led to demolition of 360 to 370 homes in the West Side neighborhood between Adams and Jackson streets . The construction of the highway led to the decline of the residential and commercial base in Wilmington . Work was also underway on the portion of I @-@ 95 northeast of Wilmington , which would parallel the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad . In 1966 , I @-@ 95 was completed and opened to traffic between the Christina River interchange with I @-@ 295 and I @-@ 495 and downtown Wilmington , where ramps connected the highway to Maryland Avenue and Lancaster Avenue . The completion of this section of I @-@ 95 provided an uninterrupted freeway connection between Wilmington and Baltimore . The ramps to downtown Wilmington were added as a compromise of building the freeway through the city and would bring economic development to the Wilmington Riverfront . In August 1968 , I @-@ 95 between the South Wilmington Viaduct and US 202 was completed and opened to traffic . On November 1 , 1968 , the freeway was opened between US 202 and the Pennsylvania border . With this , the entire length of I @-@ 95 in Delaware was constructed , making Delaware the third state to complete its section of I @-@ 95 .

 In November 1968 , work began to widen the Delaware Turnpike from four to six lanes to handle increasing traffic volumes . The widening project was completed in December 1969 , one year ahead of schedule . In 1969 , a plan was made to widen the turnpike between DE 896 and DE 273 to ten lanes and between DE 273 and DE 141 to 12 lanes in a 3 @-@ 3 @-@ 3 @-@ 3 local @-@ express lane configuration . This was later scaled down to a proposal to widen the road to eight lanes total . The widening of the Delaware Turnpike to eight lanes occurred in the 1980s . From 1971 to 1978 , a north @-@ south extension of the Delaware Turnpike running south to Dover was studied . This extension of the turnpike evolved into a " Relief Route " for US 13 and was built as DE 1 between 1987 and 2003 . 
 On June 28 , 1978 , the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials ( AASHTO ) approved rerouting I @-@ 95 along the I @-@ 495 alignment . However , AASHTO disapproved renumbering the alignment of I @-@ 95 through Wilmington as I @-@ 595 . On October 27 of that year , AASHTO gave conditional approval for I @-@ 95 through Wilmington to be designated as I @-@ 195 from I @-@ 95 near Newport north to US 202 while the route from US 202 to I @-@ 95 in Claymont would become I @-@ 395 . I @-@ 895 was designated along the conditionally approved route of I @-@ 195 and I @-@ 395 on June 25 , 1979 . In 1980 , the South Wilmington Viaduct was reconstructed . On November 14 , 1980 , I @-@ 95 and I @-@ 495 were returned to their original alignments , with I @-@ 895 decommissioned . US 202 was designated concurrent with I @-@ 95 through Wilmington in 1984 . 
 In 2000 , I @-@ 95 was completely rebuilt between US 202 and the Pennsylvania border . The reconstruction completely tore apart the concrete pavement and replaced it with asphalt and also improved drainage and rebuilt bridges . In April 2000 , the southbound lanes were closed , with the lanes between DE 3 and US 202 reopening in May and the remainder reopening in mid @-@ summer . In July , the northbound lanes were closed , with the lanes reopening between US 202 and DE 3 in September and the remainder reopening in October . During the closure , through traffic was detoured to I @-@ 495 . 
 In 2003 , work began on rebuilding the bridge carrying DE 58 over the highway to allow for future improvements to I @-@ 95 , with completion in fall 2006 , a year behind schedule . In May 2007 , construction began to widen I @-@ 95 between the DE 1 / DE 7 and DE 141 interchanges from eight to ten lanes due to rising traffic levels and increased development . The widening project was completed in November 2008 . Traffic congestion at the cloverleaf interchange with DE 1 / DE 7 in Christiana led to DelDOT to improve the interchange . The project included adding flyover connecting ramps from northbound DE 1 to northbound I @-@ 95 and from southbound I @-@ 95 to southbound DE 1 which allowed for easier merging patterns and the elimination of lengthy backups on the former ramp design . Construction of a new " ring access road " around Christiana Mall began in February 2011 and was completed in March 2012 , with a newly built bridge over DE 1 , just south of the I @-@ 95 interchange . The ramp from southbound I @-@ 95 to southbound DE 1 / DE 7 opened on August 27 , 2013 and the ramp from northbound DE 1 / DE 7 to northbound I @-@ 95 opened on October 17 , 2013 , with a ribbon cutting ceremony attended by Governor Jack Markell and DelDOT secretary Shailen Bhatt . 
 In December 2011 , a project began to improve the interchange between I @-@ 95 and US 202 / DE 202 in order to reduce congestion . The project widened the ramp between northbound I @-@ 95 and northbound US 202 to two lanes , the ramp between southbound US 202 and southbound I @-@ 95 was extended to modern standards , and the ramp between southbound I @-@ 95 and southbound DE 202 was relocated from a cloverleaf loop to a directional ramp that intersects DE 202 at a signalized intersection . In addition , the interchange ramps were repaved and bridges were rehabilitated . The project was finished in July 2015 , months behind schedule due to the closure of I @-@ 495 in 2014 . On August 7 , 2015 , a dedication ceremony to mark the completion of the project was held , with Governor Markell , Senator Tom Carper , and DelDOT secretary Jennifer Cohan in attendance . The project , which cost over $ 33 million , was 80 @-@ percent funded by the federal government . 
 On June 2 , 2014 , the I @-@ 495 bridge over the Christina River was closed after it was discovered that four support columns were tilting . During this closure , traffic from I @-@ 495 was detoured onto I @-@ 95 , and several major roads in the Wilmington area experienced increased traffic congestion . The southbound lanes of I @-@ 495 reopened on July 31 , a month earlier than expected , and the northbound lanes of I @-@ 495 reopened on August 23 .

 = Vengeance ( 2005 ) = 
 Vengeance ( 2005 ) was a professional wrestling pay @-@ per @-@ view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) and presented by THQ 's Juiced , which took place on June 26 , 2005 , at the Thomas & Mack Center in Las Vegas , Nevada . It was the fifth annual Vengeance event . Professional wrestling is a type of sports entertainment in which theatrical events are combined with a competitive sport . The buildup to the matches and the scenarios that took place before , during , and after the event were planned by WWE 's script writers . The event starred wrestlers from the Raw brand : storyline expansions of the promotion where employees are assigned to wrestling brands under the WWE banner . 
 The main event was a Hell in a Cell match for the World Heavyweight Championship between Batista and Triple H , which Batista won by pinfall after executing a Batista Bomb . One of the predominant matches on the card was John Cena versus Chris Jericho versus Christian in a Triple Threat match for the WWE Championship . Cena won the match and retained the title after pinning Christian . Another primary match on the undercard was Kurt Angle versus Shawn Michaels in a rematch of their bout at WrestleMania 21 . Michaels won the match by pinfall after executing Sweet Chin Music . 
 Many of the existing feuds were settled following the event . Notably , Batista was drafted to the SmackDown ! brand , thus ending his feud with Triple H. The feud between Kane and Edge also concluded after the event , as Edge entered an angle with Matt Hardy . The feud between Cena and Jericho , however , continued and led to a match at SummerSlam , which Cena won . 
 = = Background = = 
 The event featured six professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre @-@ existing scripted feuds , plots and storylines . Wrestlers portrayed either a villainous or fan favorite gimmick as they followed a series of events which generally built tension , leading to a wrestling match . The name of a wrestler 's character was not always the person 's birth name , as wrestlers often use a stage name to portray their character . All wrestlers were from the Raw brand – a storyline division in which WWE assigned its employees to a different program , the other being SmackDown ! . 
 The main feud heading into Vengeance was between Batista and Triple H , with the two battling over the World Heavyweight Championship . After Batista defeated Triple H at WrestleMania 21 , they continued to fight over the World title at the next Raw pay @-@ per @-@ view , Backlash , which saw Batista retain the title . Following Backlash , a series of Gold Rush Tournament matches to determine a number one contender to face Batista for the World title took place with Kane , Shawn Michaels , Edge , and Chris Benoit winning in the first round of the tournament . In this round , Benoit forced Triple H to submit to the Crippler Crossface , Benoit 's submission finisher . On the May 23 , 2005 episode of Raw , Batista faced Edge , who had beat out Michaels and Kane for an opportunity at the World title . Batista retained the title after he pinned Edge following a Batista Bomb . Following the match , Triple H attacked Batista with a sledgehammer and challenged him to a Hell in a Cell match . After making the challenge , Triple H performed a Pedigree to Batista on the World title . Batista accepted Triple H 's challenge , which led to a contract signing for their scheduled match at Vengeance , which would be for the World Heavyweight title in a Hell in a Cell match at Vengeance . 
 The other main feud heading into the event was between John Cena , Chris Jericho and Christian , with the three battling over the WWE Championship . On the June 6 episode of Raw , John Cena 's SmackDown ! tenure came to an end when he became the first wrestler selected by the Raw brand General Manager , Eric Bischoff , in the draft lottery . Cena was introduced as Raw 's newest member in Chris Jericho 's segment , the Highlight Reel , but Christian interrupted and called Cena a poser . This built on their existing rivalry , as Cena and Christian had an encounter at the Royal Rumble , in which Christian claimed that he was a better rapper than Cena . At the time , Cena was a member of the SmackDown ! brand and Christian was part of the Raw brand . Over the next months , Christian began cutting promos denouncing Cena as a ' poser ' . Cena rebutted Christian 's comments by performing a freestyle rap about Christian , which quickly led to the two brawling in the ring . The same evening , Cena entered a feud with Bischoff by refusing to participate in Bischoff 's " war " against the upcoming Extreme Championship Wrestling reunion show . On the June 13 episode of Raw , Bischoff booked a WWE title match between Christian and Cena at Vengeance , although Jericho protested the idea of Christian being the contender to face Cena for the title . Later that night , Cena and Jericho were placed in a tag team match and faced off against Christian and Tyson Tomko . Cena and Jericho won the match after Cena got the pinfall . After the match , Jericho turned on Cena and attacked him . Bischoff then changed the original match between Cena and <unk> to a Triple Threat match at Vengeance that also included Jericho . 
 One of the main matches on the undercard was between Kurt Angle and Shawn Michaels . At the start of the year , Angle and Michaels both participated in the Royal Rumble match at the 2005 Royal Rumble pay @-@ per @-@ view event . During the match , Michaels eliminated Angle . In retaliation , Angle returned to the match and eliminated Michaels and then attacked him outside the ring . The two engaged in a feud , which led to an Interpromotional match at WrestleMania 21 , as Angle was part of the SmackDown ! roster and Michaels belonged to the Raw roster . At WrestleMania 21 , Angle got the win over Michaels by forcing him to submit to the Ankle Lock . On the June 13 episode of Raw , Angle was revealed to be the second draft pick for the Raw brand . That same evening , Michaels challenged Angle to a rematch at Vengeance , which Angle accepted . 
 The Divas match set for Vengeance was between Victoria and Christy Hemme . On the May 30 edition of Raw , Christy Hemme won a bikini contest ; defeating Victoria , Candice Michelle , Maria , and Lilian Garcia . After the contest ended , Victoria turned into a villainess by attacking all of the participants , saving Hemme for last . In a backstage interview following her heel turn , the evil Victoria expressed jealousy of Hemme , stating that she was tired of Hemme getting all of the attention . On the June 20 episode of Raw , it was announced in a backstage interview that Hemme and Victoria would face each other at Vengeance . Hemme stated that she couldn 't wait to get her hands on Victoria , but during the segment , Victoria interrupted the interview by smashing a glass jar on the back of Hemme 's head . 
 = = Event = = 
 Before the event went live on pay @-@ per @-@ view , Rosey and The Hurricane ( with Super Stacy ) defeated The Heart Throbs ( Antonio and Romeo ) in a match taped for Sunday Night Heat . The first match that aired was between Carlito and Shelton Benjamin for the Intercontinental Championship . After back and forth action , Carlito removed the padding from one of the turnbuckles . Benjamin then hit his head on the exposed metal while performing a Stinger splash . Carlito pinned Benjamin with a roll @-@ up , allowing Carlito to retain the Intercontinental Championship . 
 Next was a match between Victoria and Christy Hemme . The match saw Victoria lift Hemme in the air and drop her down with force . Control of the match went back and forth , but the bout came to an end when Victoria countered Hemme 's sunset flip . Victoria got the pinfall by using the ring ropes for leverage . 
 The third match of the night saw Kane in a match with Edge , during which both men took the upper hand . Snitsky interfered in the match , hitting Kane with a big boot . Moments later , Snitsky was quickly taken out by Edge after he hit him with his Money in the Bank briefcase . Following the events in the match , Kane performed a chokeslam and pinned Edge . 
 This bout was followed by a WrestleMania 21 rematch that involved Shawn Michaels and Kurt Angle . In a brawling match , Angle had an Ankle Lock hold applied on Michaels . Moments later , however , Michaels recuperated and performed Sweet Chin Music on Angle before pinning Angle for the win . After the match , both men were given a standing ovation . An in @-@ ring segment took place next between Raw 's ring announcer , Lilian Garcia and Viscera . During the segment , Garcia proposed to Viscera . Before Viscera could have given an answer , he was interrupted by The Godfather . The Godfather gave Viscera advice about the life he would miss out on if he got married . This led to Viscera rejecting Garcia 's marriage proposal and leaving the ring with the Godfather 's hos and abandoning a crying Garcia in the ring . 
 The fifth match was a Triple Threat match for the WWE Championship between champion John Cena , Christian , and Chris Jericho . The match saw all three wrestlers take the advantage over one another . A spot in the match included Jericho applying the Walls of Jericho on Cena , but he released the move and performed a springboard dropkick on Christian , after Christian got up on the ring apron . Late in the match , Jericho reversed an Unprettier attempt by Christian by tossing Christian directly to Cena . Cena hoisted Christian onto his shoulders , performed an FU , and pinned Christian to retain the WWE title . 
 The final match of the event was a Hell in a Cell bout between Batista and Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship . During the match , Triple H choked Batista with a chain and hit him in the back with a steel chair wrapped with barbed wire . Batista regained the momentum by grabbing Triple H 's sledgehammer and hitting him in the mouth . Batista retained the World title after he performed a spinebuster on Triple H onto the steel steps , which was followed with a Batista Bomb and a cover for the win . After the Hell in a Cell match , Triple H stood to his feet and was given a standing ovation by the audience . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Immediately after their Hell in a Cell match as an exclusive to WWE Home Video , Triple H ( with Ric Flair ) and Batista encountered backstage to put their differences aside and embraced with Triple H quipping " This is Evolution , baby " , referring to their past as a stable , which had disbanded until 2014 . 
 In June 2005 , the 2005 WWE Draft Lottery took place , in which wrestlers were drafted and traded between the Raw and SmackDown ! brands . On the June 30 episode of SmackDown ! , Batista 's tenure on the Raw brand ended , when he was SmackDown ! ' s final pick in the draft lottery . SmackDown ! General Manager Theodore Long scheduled a six @-@ man elimination match between John " Bradshaw " Layfield ( JBL ) , The Undertaker , Muhammad Hassan , Chris Benoit , Booker T and Christian , in which the winner would receive the SmackDown ! Championship , as the WWE Championship had been moved to the Raw brand . JBL won the match , but Teddy Long informed JBL that he did not win the SmackDown ! championship . As the winner of the match , however , he would face Batista for the World Heavyweight Championship . On the July 7 episode of SmackDown ! , it was revealed that the match between JBL and Batista would take place at The Great American Bash . At The Great American Bash , Batista was disqualified for attacking JBL with a chair . JBL won the match , but did not win the title because a title never changes hands by countout or disqualification . 
 Following Vengeance , Eric Bischoff vowed to make John Cena 's stint on Raw difficult , he " hand picked " Chris Jericho to take the WWE title off Cena by booking a match between Cena and Jericho at SummerSlam . During their feud , even though Cena was portrayed as the face and Jericho as the heel , a vocal section of live crowds nonetheless chose to boo Cena during their matches , including at SummerSlam where Cena retained the title after executing an FU . 
 After a successful tag team win at Backlash , in which Shawn Michaels and Hulk Hogan defeated Muhammad Hassan and Daivari . Michaels and Hogan were placed in tag team match against Kurt Angle and Carlito on an episode of Raw . The match saw Hogan and Michaels get the victory . During the post @-@ match pose , Michaels superkicked Hogan , which knocked Hogan to the ground and turning Michaels heel for the first time since returning to the company in 2002 . The following week , Michaels challenged Hogan to a match at SummerSlam , which Hogan accepted . In this match , Hogan maintained his perfect record at SummerSlam by defeating Michaels . 
 The feud between Edge and Kane came to an end when Edge was put in an angle with Matt Hardy . On the July 11 episode of Raw , Hardy , who at the time was unemployed by WWE , made a surprise appearance , interfering in a match between Edge and Kane . The following week , as both Edge and Lita were walking towards the ring before a scheduled Steel cage match against Kane , Hardy attacked Edge from behind . On the August 1 episode of Raw , Vince McMahon officially announced Hardy 's return to WWE , adding that Hardy would face Edge at SummerSlam . The following week , Hardy made his in @-@ ring return , defeating Snitsky . After the victory , Hardy was attacked by Edge , and was carried backstage . In retaliation , Hardy counterattacked Edge in the locker room . At SummerSlam , Edge was given the win in the match after Hardy hit the ring post and began to bleed profusely , which caused the referee to stop the match . 
 After a four @-@ month hiatus , Triple H returned on the WWE Homecoming episode of Raw on October 3 . He took part in a match , teaming up with Ric Flair , who was wrestling as a face , to take on Chris Masters and Carlito . The duo defeated Masters and Carlito ; after the match , Triple H turned on Flair and hit him with a sledgehammer . This led to an angle between Triple H and Flair . At Taboo Tuesday , Triple H and Flair met in a Steel cage match , a stipulation chosen by the fans , for the Intercontinental Championship . The match saw Flair retain the Intercontinental Championship , after escaping through the cage door .

 = Elizabeth Rona = 
 Elizabeth Rona ( 20 March 1890 – 27 July 1981 ) was a Hungarian nuclear chemist , known for her work with radioactive isotopes . After developing an enhanced method of preparing polonium samples , she was internationally recognized as the leading expert in isotope separation and polonium preparation . Between 1914 and 1918 , during her postdoctoral study with George de Hevesy , she developed a theory that the velocity of diffusion depended on the mass of the nuclides . As only a few atomic elements had been identified , her confirmation of the existence of Uranium @-@ Y was a major contribution to nuclear chemistry . She was awarded the <unk> Prize by the Austrian Academy of Sciences in 1933 . 
 After emigrating to the United States in 1941 , she was granted a Carnegie Fellowship to continue her research and provided technical information on her polonium extraction methods to the Manhattan Project . Later in her career , she became a nuclear chemistry professor at the Oak Ridge Institute of Nuclear Studies and after 15 years there transferred to the Institute of Marine Sciences at the University of Miami . At both Oak Ridge and Miami , she continued her work on the geochronology of seabed elements and radiometric dating . She was posthumously inducted into the Tennessee Women 's Hall of Fame in 2015 . 
 = = Early life and education = = 
 Elizabeth Rona was born on 20 March 1890 in Budapest , Hungary , to Ida , ( née Mahler ) and Samuel Róna . Her father was a prosperous Jewish physician who worked with Louis Wickham and Henri @-@ August Dominici , founders of radium therapy , to introduce the techniques to Budapest , and installed one of the first x @-@ ray machines there . Elizabeth wanted to become a physician like her father , but Samuel believed that it would be too difficult for a woman to attain . Though he died when she was in her second year of university , Rona 's father had encouraged her and spurred her interest in science from a young age . She enrolled in the Philosophy Faculty at the University of Budapest , studying chemistry , geochemistry , and physics , receiving her PhD in 1912 . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Rona began her postdoctoral training in 1912 at the Animal Physiology Institute in Berlin and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute , studying yeast as a reagent . In 1913 she transferred to Karlsruhe University , working under the direction of Kasimir Fajans , the discoverer of isotopes , for the next eight months . During the summer of 1914 , she studied at University College London , but returned to Budapest at the outbreak of World War I. Taking a position at Budapest 's Chemical Institute , she completed a scientific paper on the " diffusion constant of radon in water " . Working with George de Hevesy , she was asked to verify a new element — at the time was termed Uranium @-@ Y , now known as Th @-@ 231 . Though others had failed to confirm the element , Rona was able to separate the Uranium @-@ Y from interfering elements , proving it was a beta emitter ( β @-@ emission ) with a half @-@ life of 25 hours . The Hungarian Academy of Sciences published her findings . Rona first coined the terms " isotope labels " and " tracers " during this study , noting that the velocity of diffusion depended on the mass of the nuclides . Though contained in a footnote , this was the basis for the development of the mass spectrographic and heavy water studies later performed by other scientists . In addition to her scientific proficiency , Rona spoke English , French , German , and Hungarian . 
 When Hevesy left Budapest , in 1918 Franz <unk> , a noted biochemist and physiologist of the University of Budapest , offered Rona a teaching position . She taught chemistry to selected students whom <unk> felt had insufficient knowledge to complete the course work , becoming the first woman to teach chemistry at university level in Hungary . 
 The apartment in which Rona and her mother were living was seized when the communists invaded Hungary in 1919 . Owing to political instability and the persecution of those with communist sympathies during the countering White Terror , an increasing amount of work at the Institute fell to Rona . When offered a position in 1921 to return to Dahlem and the Kaiser Wilhelm Institute , by Otto Hahn , Rona resigned . She joined Hahn 's staff in Berlin to separate ionium ( now known as Th @-@ 230 ) from uranium . Hyperinflation in the Weimar Republic forced her transfer to the Textile Fiber Institute of Kaiser Wilhelm , as practical research was the only work permitted at the time . Theoretical research with no essential application was not a priority . Her training allowed her to return to a more stable Hungary and accept a position in a textile factory there in 1923 . She did not care for the work and soon left , joining the staff of the Institute for Radium Research of Vienna in 1924 at the request of Stefan Meyer . Her research there focused on measuring the absorption and range of hydrogen rays , as well as on developing polonium as an alternative radioactive material to radium . 
 = = Austria = = 
 As early as 1926 , Meyer had written to Irène Joliot @-@ Curie suggesting that Rona work with her to learn how his laboratory could make their own polonium samples . Once Hans Pettersson was able to secure funds to pay Rona 's expenses , Joliot @-@ Curie allowed her to come and study polonium separation at the Curie Institute in Paris . Rona developed an enhanced method of preparing polonium sources and producing alpha @-@ emissions . ( α @-@ emission ) . Gaining recognition as an expert in the field , she took those skills back to the Radium Institute along with a small disc of polonium . This disc allowed Rona to create lab specimens of polonium , which were used in much of the Institute 's subsequent research . 
 Her skills were in high demand and she formed many collaborations in Vienna , working with Ewald Schmidt on the modification of Paul <unk> @-@ Maury 's method of vaporizing polonium ; with Marietta Blau on photographic emulsions of hydrogen rays ; and with Hans Pettersson . In 1928 , Pettersson asked her to analyze a sample of sea bottom sediment to determine its radium content . Because the lab she was working in was contaminated , she took the samples to the oceanographic laboratory at Bornö Marine Research Station on Stora Bornö in <unk> , Sweden , which would become her summer research destination for the next 12 years . Her analyses with Berta Karlik on the half @-@ lives of uranium , thorium , and actinium decay identified radiometric dating and elemental alpha particle ranges . In 1933 , Rona and Karlik won the Austrian Academy of Sciences <unk> Prize . 
 In 1934 , Rona was back in Paris studying with Joliot @-@ Curie , who had discovered artificial radioactivity . Soon after , Curie died and Rona became ill , but she was able to return to Vienna late the following year to share what had been learned with a group of researchers made up of Pettersson , Elizabeth Kara @-@ <unk> , and Ernst <unk> , who was serving as an assistant to Ellen Gleditsch at that time . Their studies centered on research of the effect caused by bombarding radionuclides with neutrons . In 1935 Rona consolidated some of these relationships , working on Stora Bornö , then visiting Gleditsch in Oslo , then traveling to Copenhagen to see Hevesy , and later to <unk> , Sweden to meet with Karlik and Pettersson . One of the projects the group had been working on for several years was to determine if there was any correlation between water depth and radium content , and their seawater research evaluated the concentration of elements in seawater collected from different locations . 
 After the 1938 Anschluss , Rona and Marietta Blau left the Radium Institute because of their Jewish heritage and the antisemitic persecution they experienced in the laboratory . Rona first returned to Budapest and worked in an industrial laboratory , but within a few months , the position was eliminated . She worked from October to December 1938 in Sweden , and then accepted a temporary position for one year at the University of Oslo , which had been offered by Gleditsch . Reluctant to leave her home , at the end of her year in Oslo , Rona returned to Hungary . She was appointed to a position at the Radium @-@ Cancer Hospital in Budapest , preparing radium for medicinal purposes . 
 = = Emigration = = 
 Faced with encroaching Russians on one side and the Nazi involvement in Hungary during World War II on the other , in early 1941 Rona obtained a visitor 's visa and fled to the United States . For three months she was unemployed and suspected of being a spy , though she sought help from scientists she had worked with in Europe to find employment . At a meeting of the American Physical Society , she met Austrian physicist Karl Herzfeld , who helped her secure a teaching post at Trinity College in Washington , D.C. During this period , she was awarded a Carnegie Fellowship to research at the Geophysical Laboratory of the Carnegie Institute , working on analysis of seawater and sediments . Between 1941 and 1942 , she conducted work at Carnegie in conjunction with the Woods Hole Oceanographic Institution , measuring the amount of radium in seawater and river water . Her study , completed in 1942 , showed that the ratio of radium to uranium was lower in seawater and higher in river water . 
 After returning from a summer visit to Los Altos , California , Rona received a vague telegram from the Institute of Optics at the University of Rochester referencing war work and polonium , but no details of an assignment . When Rona responded that she would be interested in helping with the war effort but had immigration issues , a man identifying himself as Brian O 'Bryen appeared in her office and explained the nature of the confidential work for the Manhattan Project . They proposed buying her method of polonium extraction and gave specific instructions for the type of assistants she might use — someone unfamiliar with chemistry or physics . Her non @-@ citizen status did not preclude her from working for the Office of Scientific Research and Development ( OSRD ) , to which she gave her methods without compensation . Before the Manhattan Project , polonium had been used only in small samples , but the project proposed to use both polonium and beryllium to create a reaction forcing neutrons to be ejected and ignite the fission reaction required for the atom bomb . Plutonium plants , based on her specifications for what was needed to process element , were built in the New Mexico desert at Los Alamos National Laboratory , but Rona was given no details . 
 Rona 's methods were also used as part of the experiments conducted by the Office of Human Radiation Experiments to determine the effects of human exposure to radiation . Early in her career , she had been exposed to the dangers of radium . Rona 's requests for protective gas masks were denied , as Stefan Meyer downplayed the hazards of exposure . She purchased protective gear with her own money , not believing there was no danger . When vials of radioactive material exploded and the laboratory became contaminated , Rona was convinced her mask had saved her . Gleditsch had also warned her of the dangers the year Rona was sick and living in Paris , when Joliot @-@ Curie died , emphasizing the risk of radium @-@ related anemia . In her 1978 book about her experiences , Rona wrote about the damage to bones , hands , and lungs of the scientists studying radioactivity . Since they wore no gloves and frequently poured substances between vials without protection , she noted that their thumbs , forefingers , and ring fingers were often damaged . The secrecy surrounding the project makes it difficult to know if any of the scientists not directly working on any project knew specifically what their contributions were being used for . 
 = = Later career = = 
 Rona continued teaching until 1946 at Trinity . In 1947 , she began working at the Argonne National Laboratory . Her work there focused on ion exchange reactions and she published several works for the United States Atomic Energy Commission . In 1948 , she became a naturalized U.S. citizen . In 1950 , she began research work at the Oak Ridge Institute of Nuclear Studies as a chemist and senior scientist in nuclear studies . During this period , she collaborated with Texas A & M University on the geochronology of seabed sediments , dating core samples by estimating their radioactive decay . She retired from Oak Ridge in 1965 and then went to work at the University of Miami , teaching at the Institute of Marine Sciences where she worked for a decade . Rona retired for a second time in 1976 and returned to Tennessee in the late 1970s , publishing a book in 1978 on her radioactive tracer methods . 
 Rona died on 27 July 1981 in Oak Ridge , Tennessee . She was posthumously inducted into the Tennessee Women 's Hall of Fame in 2015 .

 = Interstate 94 in Michigan = 
 Interstate 94 ( I @-@ 94 ) is a part of the Interstate Highway System that runs from Billings , Montana , to the Lower Peninsula of the US state of Michigan . In Michigan , it is a state trunkline highway that enters the state south of New Buffalo and runs eastward through several metropolitan areas in the southern section of the state . The highway serves Benton Harbor , Kalamazoo , Battle Creek on the west side of the peninsula . From there it also runs through Jackson and Ann Arbor , and portions of Metro Detroit , before angling northeasterly to Port Huron , where it terminates on the Blue Water Bridge at the Canadian border . 
 The first segment of what later became I @-@ 94 within the state , the Willow Run Expressway , was built near Ypsilanti and Belleville in 1941 , with an easterly extension to Detroit in 1945 . This expressway was initially numbered M @-@ 112 . By 1960 , the length of I @-@ 94 was completed from Detroit to New Buffalo . Subsequent extensions in the 1960s completed most of the rest of the route . The last segment opened to the public in 1972 when Indiana completed their connection across the state line . The routing of I @-@ 94 is notable for containing the first full freeway @-@ to @-@ freeway interchange in the United States , connecting to the Lodge Freeway ( M @-@ 10 ) , and for comprising the first complete border @-@ to @-@ border toll @-@ free freeway in a state in the United States . The highway has one auxiliary route , Interstate 194 , which serves downtown Battle Creek , and eight business routes . 
 = = Route description = = 
 The entire length of I @-@ 94 is listed on the National Highway System , a network of roadways important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility . The freeway carries 154 @,@ 800 vehicles on average between I @-@ 75 and Chene Street in Detroit and 15 @,@ 370 vehicles immediately east of the Blue Water Bridge in Port Huron ; the highest and lowest traffic counts in 2013 , respectively . As the state trunkline highway closest to the lake shore in these areas , I @-@ 94 carries the Lake Michigan Circle Tour south of Benton Harbor – St. Joseph and the Lake Huron Circle Tour in the Port Huron area . Sections through the Detroit area are named the Detroit Industrial and Edsel Ford freeways . I @-@ 94 in the state is either a four- or six @-@ lane freeway for most of its length ; one segment in the Detroit area has up to ten lanes total near the airport . 
 = = = Southwestern Michigan = = = 
 I @-@ 94 crosses into Michigan south of New Buffalo and parallels the Lake Michigan shoreline about three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) inland . The freeway runs northeasterly through rural Michiana farmland in the southwestern corner of the Lower Peninsula . I @-@ 94 traverses an area just east of the Warren Dunes State Park as the freeway runs parallel to the Red Arrow Highway . I @-@ 94 crosses its companion highway south of St. Joseph ; Red Arrow turns northward carrying the business loop for Benton Harbor and St. Joseph . The freeway curves further inland to cross the St. Joseph River near Riverview Park . East of Benton Harbor , I @-@ 94 meets the Napier Avenue where US 31 merges onto the freeway . East of the Southwest Michigan Regional Airport , I @-@ 94 / US 31 meets the southern end of I @-@ 196 ; US 31 departs the I @-@ 94 freeway to follow I @-@ 196 , and I @-@ 94 continues its course away from Lake Michigan . 
 South of Coloma , I @-@ 94 turns eastward and roughly follows the Paw Paw River on a course that takes it south of Watervliet and Hartford . Between the latter two cities , the freeway crosses from northeastern Berrien County into western Van Buren County . It curves around and between Lake Cora and <unk> Lake near the junction with the northern end of M @-@ 51 . About four miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) further east , I @-@ 94 crosses M @-@ 40 south of Paw Paw . Continuing eastward , I @-@ 94 runs south of <unk> before crossing into western Kalamazoo County . 
 In Texas Township , the freeway enters the western edges of the Kalamazoo suburbs . South of the campus for Western Michigan University 's College of Engineering & Applied Sciences in Portage , I @-@ 94 intersects US 131 . That freeway also carries Kalamazoo 's business loop northward . Near the Kalamazoo / Battle Creek International Airport , I @-@ 94 crosses into the southeastern corner of Kalamazoo before entering Comstock Township . The freeway intersects the eastern end of the business loop at a partial interchange near Morrow Lake in the township . I @-@ 94 continues eastward out of the eastern Kalamazoo suburbs . It parallels the Kalamazoo River through the Galesburg area . Before crossing into Calhoun County on the east side of Battle Creek , I @-@ 94 has the only driveway on any of Michigan 's Interstate Highways for a gate providing access for military vehicles into the Fort Custer Training Center . 
 I @-@ 94 crosses into Calhoun County southwest of the W. K. Kellogg Airport and enters the city of Battle Creek . Immediately east of the county line , the freeway has an interchange with the western end of Battle Creek 's business loop . Next to the Lakeview Square Mall , I @-@ 94 meets its own auxiliary Interstate in Michigan : I @-@ 194 . I @-@ 94 turns to the northwest to round Beadle Lake , intersecting M @-@ 294 before crossing the Kalamazoo River . East of the river crossing , the freeway meets an interchange for M @-@ 96 , M @-@ 311 and the eastern end of the Battle Creek business loop near the <unk> Casino in Emmett Township . Turning back eastward , I @-@ 94 exits the eastern Battle Creek suburbs and continues to an interchange with I @-@ 69 near Marshall ; the business loop for Marshall follows I @-@ 69 southward . 
 = = = Into Metro Detroit = = = 
 Continuing eastward I @-@ 94 traverses rural land on the north side of Marshall . The freeway runs north of , and parallel to , the Kalamazoo River through eastern Calhoun County . It angles southeasterly toward Albion before returning to an easterly course on the north side of town . I @-@ 94 crosses into western Jackson County before intersecting M @-@ 99 . From there , it runs generally due east with a jog around Parma on a course to Jackson . West of the Jackson County Airport , the Jackson business loop follows M @-@ 60 southward and I @-@ 94 travels through the north side of Jackson . North of downtown , US 127 merges in from the north and runs concurrently with I @-@ 94 around the city . Southeast of the Michigan State Prison , US 127 departs to the south , and I @-@ 94 continues eastward through eastern Jackson County . 
 The freeway runs north of a racetrack complex in Chelsea next to the M @-@ 52 interchange . As I @-@ 94 continues easterly , it passes into the western edge of the Ann Arbor area . West of downtown , the M @-@ 14 freeway splits off to the northeast , and I @-@ 94 turns to the south and southeast to curve around the south side of the city . The freeway passes between the Briarwood Mall and the Ann Arbor Municipal Airport . On the southeastern corner of Ann Arbor , I @-@ 94 intersects US 23 and continues around the south side of Ypsilanti . South of that city , the freeway also carries US 12 and crosses the Huron River north of its entry into Ford Lake . I @-@ 94 jogs southeasterly around the south side of the Willow Run Airport complex and crosses into Wayne County . 
 South of Willow Run , I @-@ 94 parallels Belleville Lake . East of the lake , it intersects I @-@ 275 near the northwest corner of Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport and angles northeasterly through the southwestern Detroit suburbs along the Detroit Industrial Freeway . I @-@ 94 used the Gateway Bridge over the single @-@ point interchange at US 24 ( Telegraph Road ) in Taylor ; these bridges were inspired by Super Bowl XL and provide a western gateway to the city . Further east , the freeway intersects M @-@ 39 ( Southfield Freeway ) and passes the Uniroyal Giant Tire in Allen Park . I @-@ 94 then turns to the northeast through the Ford River Rouge Complex in Dearborn before turning back easterly on the Edsel Ford Freeway into Detroit . 
 I @-@ 94 crosses Detroit in an east – west direction well inland of , and parallel to , the Detroit River . The freeway intersects I @-@ 96 ( Jeffries Freeway ) and M @-@ 10 ( Lodge Freeway ) on the West Side , passing the main campus of Wayne State University before crossing onto the East Side at M @-@ 1 ( Woodward Avenue ) . Immediately east of the interchange with I @-@ 75 ( Chrysler Freeway ) , I @-@ 94 forms the southern border of the Milwaukee Junction district . The Edsel Ford Freeway continues through residential neighborhoods of Detroit 's East Side . I @-@ 94 turns more northerly , mimicking the shoreline of Lake St. Clair , and exits Detroit for Harper Woods . Just north of the interchange for M @-@ 102 ( Vernier Road ) , the freeway crosses 8 Mile Road and enters Macomb County . 
 = = = North to Canada = = = 
 Running northward through Macomb County , I @-@ 94 meets the eastern end of I @-@ 696 ( Reuther Freeway ) about three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) north of the county line in St. Clair Shores . The freeway continues to parallel the lakeshore , and travels to the west of Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Harrison Township . I @-@ 94 turns back to the northwest at 23 Mile Road at the interchange with M @-@ 3 and M @-@ 29 . North of 26 Mile Road , the freeway exits the northern suburbs and crosses into farmland in The Thumb region . 
 South of Michigan Meadows Golf Course , I @-@ 94 crosses County Line Road and enters St. Clair County . The freeway continues northeasterly as far as Marysville before turning northward near the St. Clair County International Airport . From there , it runs roughly parallel to the St. Clair River . I @-@ 94 runs along the western edge of residential areas for Marysville and Port Huron as it continues northward . Immediately west of downtown Port Huron , I @-@ 94 intersects with I @-@ 69 ; the two freeways merge and turn first east and then north through an interchange that also features connections to BL I @-@ 69 . 
 I @-@ 94 / I @-@ 69 turns back to the east about a mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) north of their confluence to cross the Black River north of downtown . On the eastern bank of the river , there is one final interchange for M @-@ 25 and BL I @-@ 69 / BL I @-@ 94 before the freeway reaches the toll and customs plazas for the twin @-@ span Blue Water Bridge . Past these plazas , I @-@ 94 / I @-@ 69 ascends the approach to the bridge which cross the St. Clair River to Point Edward ( Sarnia ) , Ontario . At the international boundary at the center of the river , the I @-@ 94 designation jointly terminates with I @-@ 69 .

 The first major overland transportation corridors in the future state of Michigan were the Indian trails . One of these , the St. Joseph Trail , followed the path of the modern I @-@ 94 . The State Trunkline Highway System was created on May 13 , 1913 , by an act of the Michigan Legislature ; at the time , Division 6 corresponded to the rough path of today 's I @-@ 94 . In 1919 , the Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD ) signposted the highway system for the first time , and three different highways followed sections of the modern I @-@ 69 corridor . The original M @-@ 11 ran from the Indiana state line north to Coloma where M @-@ 17 connected easterly to Detroit . The third highway was M @-@ 19 from Detroit northeast to Port Huron . 
 On November 11 , 1926 , the United States Numbered Highway System was approved by the American Association of State Highway Officials ( AASHO ) , and the original route of US 12 replaced the highways from the state line northeasterly to Detroit ; US 31 overlapped the highway between St. Joseph and Watervliet . The remainder of the future I @-@ 94 corridor was served by US 25 between Detroit and Port Huron . The first span of the Blue Water Bridge opened between Port Huron and Point Edward , Ontario , in 1938 .

 The first segments of upgraded highways along the future route of I @-@ 94 were added during World War II . Construction on the Willow Run Expressway started in 1941 before the US entered the war . It was opened on September 12 , 1942 , to provide improved access to Ford 's Willow Run bomber plants . The highway was given the M @-@ 112 designation at the time . The expressway was extended eastward as the Detroit Industrial Expressway into Detroit ; the first section opened in 1943 and the remainder was completed in March 1945 . Land acquisition for the Edsel Ford Freeway started in 1945 . Originally referred to as the Crosstown Freeway , the freeway became known as the Edsel Ford Freeway following an April 1946 petition . The interchange between the Lodge Freeway and the Edsel Ford Freeway was built in 1953 as the first full freeway @-@ to @-@ freeway interchange in the United States . In mid @-@ 1956 , the M @-@ 112 designation was decommissioned and replaced by a rerouted US 12 . During the mid @-@ 1950s , the Detroit Streets and Rails campaign proposed a high @-@ speed rail line in the median of the Willow Run , Detroit Industrial and Edsel Ford freeways ; instead of building the rail line , special boarding stations adjacent to dedicated bus lanes in the interchanges along the highway were used . 
 In other parts of the state , other segments of highway were built to bypass the cities along the future I @-@ 94 corridor . In 1940 , a southern bypass of Battle Creek opened along Columbia Avenue , and the former routing through downtown on Michigan Avenue became a Business US 12 ( Bus . US 12 ) . In late 1951 or early 1952 , a northerly bypass of Jackson opened , and the former route through downtown on Michigan Avenue became another Bus . US 12 . By the next year , the western half of the Jackson bypass opened , including a bypass of Parma . In 1954 , a new bypass of Kalamazoo and Galesburg opened ; US 12 was rerouted to follow the new highway while M @-@ 96 replaced part of the old route and US 12A in the area .
