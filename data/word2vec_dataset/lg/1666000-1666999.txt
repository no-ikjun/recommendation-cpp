 Gregson @-@ Williams ' score is darker to follow suit with the film . Gregson @-@ Williams wanted Caspian 's theme to convey a vulnerability , which would sound more vibrant as he became more heroic . It originally used a 3 / 4 time signature , but the opening scene required a 4 / 4 and thus it was changed . To represent Miraz 's cunning , the heroic theme from the first film was inverted . For Reepicheep , a muted trumpet was used to present his militaristic and organised character . Gregson @-@ Williams considered arranging his theme for a small pennywhistle , but found that it sounded too cute and broke the tension of the night raid .

 During pre @-@ production , Disney announced a December 14 , 2007 release date , but pushed it back to May 16 , 2008 , because Disney opted to not release it in competition with The Water Horse , another Walden Media production . Disney also felt the Harry Potter films comfortably changed their release dates from ( Northern Hemisphere ) winters to summers , and Narnia could likewise do the same because the film was darker and more like an action film . The world premiere was held at the Ziegfeld Theatre in New York City on May 7 , 2008 . The British premiere was held at the O2 Arena on June 19 , the first time the dome has hosted a film screening . Around 10 @,@ 000 people attended the event , the proceeds of which went to Great Ormond Street Hospital . 
 The film opened in 3 @,@ 929 theaters in the United States and Canada on May 16 , 2008 . The Motion Picture Association of America gave the film a PG . To earn this rating , which the filmmakers were contractually bound by Disney to do , Adamson altered a shot of a fallen helmet to make clear that it did not contain a severed head . Adamson made numerous edits to the film beforehand after showing the film to a young audience , explaining " When you sit down and you 're watching it , and you see the kids ' faces while making the film , you 're just making an attempt , you 're making it exciting , you 're doing all of these things because you 're essentially making the film for yourself . When you start showing it to an audience , that then influences how you feel about the film . "

 Adding to the film 's $ 225 million budget ( almost $ 100 million of which were spent on the effects ) , Disney also spent $ 175 million on promoting the film . Play Along Toys created a playset of Miraz 's castle , a series of 3 ¾ -inch and 7 @-@ inch action figures , and roleplaying costumes . Weta Workshop 's Collectibles unit also created statues , busts and helmets based on their props for the film , and there was also a Monopoly edition based on the film . In the UK , Damaris Trust was commissioned to produce resources relating to the film for churches and schools , which are available from the official UK Narnia website . In June 2008 , the Journey into Narnia : Prince Caspian Attraction opened at Disney 's Hollywood Studios , featuring a recreation of the Stone Table , behind @-@ the @-@ scenes footage , concept art , storyboards , props and costumes from the film . The tone of the film 's marketing focused on the film 's action , and unlike The Lion , the Witch and the Wardrobe Disney and Walden did not screen the film for pastors or give Bible @-@ based study guides in North America .

 The film received generally positive reviews . The review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes reported that 67 % of critics gave the film positive reviews , based on 188 reviews . Metacritic reported the film had an average score of 62 out of 100 , based on 34 reviews . Audience members polled by CinemaScore mostly gave it an A − . Film critic Leonard Maltin gave the film 3 out of 4 stars ( as he did with The Lion , The Witch , and The Wardrobe ) , calling the performances " strong " , the storytelling " solid " , and the scenery " breathtaking " , though he also said , " it 's a dark tale , and the climactic battle scenes go on at length . " 
 Two film industry trade journals gave the film positive reviews . Todd McCarthy of Variety felt Adamson 's direction had a " surer sense of cinematic values " and praised the improved special effects , the " timeless " locations and production design . On the performances , he felt " the four kids overall have more character and are therefore more interesting to watch than they were before , and Italian actor Castellitto registers strongly with evil that 's implacable but not overplayed . " Michael Rechtshaffen of The Hollywood Reporter noted the film was darker than its predecessor , with " the loss of innocence theme ... significantly deepened " . He highlighted Peter Dinklage 's performance , which " outmaneuver [ ed ] the title character as Narnia 's most colorful new inhabitant " ; . 
 A number of critics took issue with what they interpreted as the film 's underlying messages . San Francisco Chronicle critic Mick Lasalle wrote in his parental advisory that " basically , this is a movie about kids who go into another world and dimension and spend the whole time killing people . " MSNBC reviewer Alonso Duralde noted that " all the heroes have British accents while the Telmarines are all decidedly Mediterranean in appearance and inflection " . An Anglican Journal review described the movie as reasonably faithful to the adventure elements of the book , much lighter on the religious faith aspects , which they found integral to the novel , and deficient on character and emotion . 
 The Visual Effects Society nominated it for Best Visual Effects and Best Compositing . It was nominated for Best Fantasy Film , Best Costumes , Best Make @-@ up , and Best Special Effects at the Saturn Awards . Keynes and Henley received nominations at the Young Artist Awards . 
 In 2010 , Mark Johnson , a producer from all of the Narnia movies , admitted that " We made some mistakes with Prince Caspian and I don 't want to make them again . " He also said Caspian lacked some of the " wonder and magic of Narnia , " was " a little bit too rough " for families , and too much of a " boys ' action movie . "

 = Aboriginal title statutes in the Thirteen Colonies = 
 Aboriginal title statutes in the Thirteen Colonies were one of the principal subjects of legislation by the colonial assemblies in the Thirteen Colonies . With the exception of Delaware , every colony codified a general prohibition on private purchases of Native American lands without the consent of the government . Disputes were generally resolved by special interest legislation or war . Mohegan Indians v. Connecticut ( 1705 – 73 ) , a lawsuit that proceeded for 70 years under special royal enabling acts only to be dismissed on non @-@ substantive grounds , was the first and only judicial test of indigenous tenure . 
 Aboriginal title remained a central political and economic issue and was listed as one of the enumerated grievances in the Declaration of Independence . Regardless , colonial land law relating to indigenous peoples became the foundation for aboriginal title in the United States during the Articles of Confederation @-@ era and after the ratification of the United States Constitution . The colonial @-@ law prohibition was codified at the federal level by the Confederation Congress Proclamation of 1783 and the Nonintercourse Acts of 1790 , 1793 , 1796 , 1799 , 1802 , and 1834 . 
 Pre @-@ Revolutionary land transactions remained the subject of political and legal disputes well after Independence . However , in sharp contrast to post @-@ 1790 transactions , no Indian tribe has yet succeeded in litigating or receiving compensation for a pre @-@ 1790 transaction . The prevailing view remains that the colonial governments , and the state governments that succeeded them during the Confederation era , had the power to authorize the alienation of indigenous lands within their borders .

 The Connecticut Colony ( est . 1636 ) and the New Haven Colony ( est . 1637 ) merged in 1662 . 
 = = = = Connecticut Colony = = = = 
 In 1637 , the Connecticut Colony authorized a military expedition to Pequot lands to “ <unk> our right that God by Conquest hath given to us . ” Soon after , the colony decided to hold sachem 's liable for the trespass of any Indian . The conquered Pequot land 's were “ dispose [ d ] . . . with lest prejudice to others that may hereafter succeed them . ” 
 The first prohibitions on transactions prohibited leases , either to or from Indians . The first prohibition on taking Indian property did not arise until 1660 . This was explicitly extended to land acquisitions in 1663 . The prohibition was strengthened in 1680 . The penalties were increased again in 1687 . 
 " Gold Hill " was the first Indian reservation in the colony , established in 1659 and confirmed in 1678 . Indians were also explicitly permitted to use public lands for hunting . In other instances , the colony resolved land disputes between competing Indians . Other reservations were established for the Mohegans in New London in 1718 and others in 1726 ( which were exempted from the application of adverse possession ) , including the Pequot 's before 1731 . 
 The power to purchase Indian lands was delegated to townships in 1702 . In 1706 , the colony offered amnesty for those who had purchased in violation of previous prohibitions as long as they provided a " true account . " In 1717 , the colony declared “ all lands in this government are holden of the King of Great Britain as the lord of the fee , ” barred the introduction of private purchases as evidence , and established a committee to " settle this whole affair . " Noting that the prohibition was among the most " ancient laws " of the colony , the fine was increased in 1722 , and treble damages were imposed . No compensation was provided in the case of eminent domain .

 = = = Maryland = = = 
 In 1639 Maryland codified separate prohibitions on land purchases from Indians and non @-@ English Europeans , set to expire at the end of the next session of the general assembly ; the latter provided : 
 Neither Shall [ a subject of the King ] <unk> procure or accept of any Land within this Province from any Indian to his own or the use of any other than the Lord Proprietarie or his heirs [ , ] nor shall hold or possess and land . . . and upon pain that every person offending . . . Shall forfeit and lose to the Lord Proprietarie and his heirs all Such Lands so accepted or held without Grant of the Lord Proprietarie under him . 
 This forfeiture provision was renewed in 1649 . Indian reservations were established in 1666 . Their boundaries were modified in 1698 , and enlarged in 1711 . Indian reservation boundaries were re @-@ surveyed in 1721 . The Nanticoke reservation was extinguished in 1768 . 
 Unlike many colonies , Maryland provided limited legal remedies for the violation of Indian property rights . In 1704 , the colony provided that non @-@ Indians who took timber from Indian lands would be “ <unk> to Action or Actions of trespass [ , ] And the persons grieved shall and may recover their Damages accordingly . ” It later authorized specific proceedings for " Indian @-@ English " disputes ; in the third such authorization , jurisdiction was extended to “ punishing Trespasses committed on their Lands , ” claims arising from the renting of Indian lands , and “ Trespasses and Wastes on such of the said Indian Lands , which have not been granted to any of the Inhabitants of this Province .

 = = = Massachusetts = = = 
 The Plymouth Colony ( est . 1620 ) and the Massachusetts Bay Colony ( est . 1628 ) merged in 1691 . After the combination of the two colonies , in 1701 , a new prohibition was codified : 
 [ A ] ll deeds of bargain , sale , lease , release , or quitclaim , titles and conveyances whatsoever , of any lands . . . within this province . . . had , made , gotten , procured or obtained from any Indian or Indians by any person or persons whatsoever at any time [ since 1633 ] without the license or approbation of the respective general courts of the said late <unk> [ or the current colony for purchases after 1701 ] shall be deemed and <unk> in the law to be null , void and of none effect . 
 The law validated all titles in Martha 's Vineyard and the Island of <unk> and all other titles preceded by a grant from the colony . Henceforth , any violator would be subject to a fine of twice the value of the land and 6 months in prison . In 1719 , the Mashpee 's lands were exempted , and their sale was authorized in 1777 . 
 In 1723 , the <unk> were exempted from property tax . In 1736 , they were granted a 6 miles square reservation , whose borders were amended several times in 1737 and 1739 . Indian lands within the township of Edgartown on Chappaquiddick were protected for 3 years in 1774 . 
 = = = = Plymouth = = = = 
 A 1643 Plymouth statute acknowledged the “ constant custome from our first beginning That no person or persons have or ever did purchase Rent or hire any lands . . . of the Natives but by the <unk> consent ” and proscribed : 
 [ I ] f any person or persons do hereafter purchase or rent or <unk> and lands . . . of any of the Natives in any place within this government with the consent and assent of the Court Every such person or persons shall <unk> [ fives times the value plus five pounds for every acre ] . 
 In 1652 , the colony legislated an exception to this prohibition , for those who had failed to satisfy the conditions of their land grants resulting in the lands being re @-@ granted to other non @-@ Indians . The exception was only to last for 14 months from the end of the Court session , but was extended until June 1656 . The colony later retroactively validated some purchases made in violation of this prohibition . In 1660 , the prohibition was interpreted to apply to gifts of land . In 1663 , the prohibition was extended to mere use . In 1668 , the prohibition was extended to " mount hope or <unk> <unk> or any other <unk> or tracts of land as there is a body of Indians upon " ; as amended , the lands would be forfeited to the colony if the purchaser could not afford the fine . 
 In 1674 , the colony established a one @-@ year statute of limitations " concerning Indian <unk> that are or shalbe made to any lands within this Government ; which are now orderly possessed by the English those which doe lay <unk> to them shall orderly <unk> and prosecute theire <unk> as farr as hee or they are able ; <unk> one <unk> after they be of age ; and noe longer and that care be taken that the Indians have notice of it .

 The Massachusetts Bay colony codified its first prohibition on private purchases of Indian lands in 1634 : “ [ N ] oe person whatsoever shall buy any land of any <unk> without leave from the Court . ” The first land recording law , instructed Steven <unk> to record , inter alia , “ all the purchases of the natives . ” 
 The Code of 1648 codified the prohibition such : “ It is ordered by <unk> of this Court ; that no person whatsoever shall henceforth buy land of any Indian , without licence first had and obtained of the General Court : and if any shall offend <unk> , such land so bought shall be forfeited to the <unk> . ” A 10 @-@ pounds @-@ per @-@ acre forfeiture was ordered in 1687 . 
 In 1652 , the colony acknowledged aboriginal title , in a statute that made reference to several biblical verses : 
 [ W ] hat <unk> any of the Indians , within this <unk> , have by possession or improvement , by <unk> of the same , they have just right thereunto , according to that Gen : 1 : 28 , chap : 9 : 1 , <unk> . : 115 , 16 .

 Only if the Indians were evicted from “ planting <unk> or fishing places , ” were the Indians to " have <unk> in any of the Courts of justice amongst the English , as the English have . " 
 In 1681 , the Dedham Indians were confined to the towns of <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . In 1685 , the colony confirmed 5 @,@ 800 acres of land to Indians in Marlborough and voided all deeds to the contrary .

 New Hampshire codified a rather weak prohibition against private purchases in 1641 : “ [ W ] <unk> buys the Indian Ground by way of purchase is to tender it first to the town [ of Exeter ] before they are to make proper use of it in particular to themselves . ” In 1677 , the colony ordered the resettlement of the Piscataqua Indians . The colony 's instructions to Edmund Andros in 1686 included instructions to purchase Indian lands . 
 New Hampshire codified a more serious prohibition in 1687 : 
 [ H ] <unk> noe person or persons whatsoever Doe presume to tamper or treat with any Indian or Indians about the purchase sale or Confirmation of any Land or Lands <unk> within this his Majesties Territory and Dominion of the New England NOR from them or any of them take or receive any Deed or Sale Gift Mortgage Conveyance Lease Contract or Confirmation whatsoever without Leave or <unk> first had and <unk> from the Governour for the tyme being under his hand and Seale On <unk> of Forfeiture of [ 20 pounds per acre ] AND that all such … shall be utterly void and null .

 = = = New Jersey = = = 
 In May 1683 , the colony authorized a Commissioner to buy lands from Indians and resell the lands in plots not to exceed 5000 acres each . In September 1683 , the colony codified a prohibition against private purchases : 
 [ N ] o Person or Persons , shall presume to buy any Tract or Tracts of Land , of , or from the Indians within this Province , without special Order and Authority to him and them given by the Governor and Commissioners , or the major Part of them for the time being . 
 Any purchase to the contrary would be “ null and void ” and subject to a fine of 5 shillings per acre . The prohibition was included in the colony 's instructions to Lord Cornbury . In 1703 , the prohibition was made more specific , to include “ Gift of Purchase in Fee , take a <unk> or Lease for Life or number of Years ” ; the authorization method was changed to “ Certificate , under the hand of the Proprietors Recorder ” ; the fine was raised to 40 shillings per acre ; and the forfeiture provision was applied to “ Purchasers , their Heirs and <unk> shall forever hereafter be incapable to hold Plea for the said Land in any Court of Common Law or Equity . ” 
 In 1758 , the colony appropriated for the Commissions “ such Sum and Sums of Money , as they may find necessary to purchase the Right and Claim of all or any of the Indian Natives of this Colony , to and for the Use of the Freeholders in this Colony , their Heirs and <unk> , for ever ” ; the maximum appropriation was to be 1600 pounds , no more than half of which was to go to the Delawares near Cranbury . As recounted by later , unrelated , judicial opinion : 
 In 1758 the State of New Jersey purchased the Indian title to lands in that State , and as a consideration for the purchase , bought a tract of land as a residence for the Indians , having previously passed an act declaring that such lands should not be subject thereafter to any tax by the State , any law or usage , or law then existing , to the contrary notwithstanding . The Indians , from the time of purchase , lived upon the land until the year 1801 , when they were authorized , by an act of the Legislature , to sell the land .

 = Bezhin Meadow = 
 Bezhin Meadow ( <unk> <unk> , Bezhin lug ) is a 1937 Soviet film famous for having been suppressed and believed destroyed before its completion . Directed by Sergei Eisenstein , it tells the story of a young farm boy whose father attempts to betray the government for political reasons by sabotaging the year 's harvest and the son 's efforts to stop his own father to protect the Soviet state , culminating in the boy 's murder and a social uprising . The film draws its title from a story by Ivan Turgenev , but is based on the life of Pavlik Morozov , a young Russian boy who became a political martyr following his death in 1932 , after he denounced his father to Soviet government authorities and subsequently died at the hands of his family . Pavlik Morozov was immortalized in school programs , poetry , music , and in film . 
 Commissioned by a communist youth group , the film 's production ran from 1935 to 1937 , until it was halted by the central Soviet government , which said it contained artistic , social , and political failures . Some , however , blamed the failure of Bezhin Meadow on government interference and policies , extending all the way to Joseph Stalin himself . In the wake of the film 's failure , Eisenstein publicly recanted his work as an error . Individuals were arrested during and after the ensuing debacle . 
 Bezhin Meadow was long thought lost in the wake of World War II bombings . In the 1960s , however , cuttings and partial prints of the film were found ; from these , a reconstruction of Bezhin Meadow , based on the original script , was undertaken . Rich in religious symbolism , the film and its history became the focus of academic study . The film was extensively discussed both inside and outside of the film industry for its historical nature , the odd circumstances of its production and failure , and its imagery , which is considered some of the greatest in cinema . In spite of the failure of Bezhin Meadow , Eisenstein would rebound to win Soviet acclaim and awards , and become artistic director of a major film studio . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Because Bezhin Meadow was repeatedly edited , re @-@ shot , and changed to satisfy the Soviet government authorities , several versions of the film were created . 
 The most sourced and best @-@ known version focuses on Stepok , a young boy in a collective farming village , who is a member of the local Young Pioneers Communist organization , as are other local children . His father Samokhin , a farmer , plans to sabotage the village harvest for political reasons by burning down the titular meadow , but Stepok organizes the other Young Pioneer children to guard the crops . Samokhin grows progressively more frustrated by his son 's actions and success . Eventually , Stepok reports Samokhin 's crimes to the Soviet government authorities , and is in turn slain by his own father for betraying his family . The other Young Pioneers break into the local church , singing songs , and desecrate it in response to Stepok 's death . The visuals of the film shift during the destruction of the church , with the villagers becoming that which they are destroying — the angry villagers , by the end of the set piece , are depicted as Christ @-@ like , angelic , and prophetic figures . 
 A later re @-@ editing of the film opens with images of orchards and blue sky , showing a stone obelisk with Turgenev 's name on it . It is next revealed that Stepok 's mother has been beaten to death by his father . In a dark hut , Samokhin complains that his son has a greater loyalty to the Soviet than his own family , as Stepok enters from the bright day outside . His father quotes from the Bible : " If the son betrays his father , kill him like a dog ! " Samokhin is arrested for arson , and Stepok leaves with a Communist functionary . The other arsonists take refuge in the local church , and are soon arrested . The arsonists are nearly lynched , but are saved from the villagers ' wrath by Stepok . The villagers transform the church into a clubhouse , symbolically ridiculing religion or the clergy . 
 In some versions , the destruction of the church was replaced with a scene of villagers fighting the arsonist 's fire . In the film , the fire was started when the arsonists threw dried sunflowers and lit matches into the community 's fuel storage area . In some cuts , Stepok overhears his father 's planning and sneaks out in the night to inform on him ; in others , the local Communist Party functionary <unk> Stepok 's young sister ; in still others , Stepok 's father says after shooting his son , " They took you from me , but I did not give you to them . I did not give my own flesh and blood . " After Stepok 's death , the same aforementioned Communist official carries him off , joined by other children , in a funeral march that was said to evolve into a victory march . 
 The film , as mentioned by Shumyatsky and Eisenstein , is rich in religious iconography and the symbolic struggle between good and evil . Additionally , Birgit <unk> writes , " The peasants here are grey @-@ bearded prophets ; the young men are broad @-@ shouldered Renaissance apostles ; the fleshy girls are earthly Madonnas ; the peasant wrecking the iconostasis is a biblical Samson ; the chubby young boy in the shirt , raised high under the cupola towards the slanting sun @-@ ray which turns his locks golden , is the young Jesus Christ ascending to the Heavenly Throne . " Bezhin Meadow , in its various unreleased versions , was " Dedicated to the bright memory of Pavlik Morozov , a small hero of our time " ( cf . A Hero of Our Time ) . 
 = = Original Turgenev story and Pavlik Morozov = = 
 The film was based in part on a story by Ivan Turgenev , a 19th @-@ century Russian scholar and novelist , but was adapted to incorporate the folk story of Pavlik Morozov , a supposed Young Pioneer glorified by Soviet Union propaganda as a martyr . Turgenev 's original short fiction titled " Bezhin Meadow " or " Bezhin Lea " was a story about peasant boys in the 1850s , in the Oryol region , discussing supernatural signs of death , while they spend the night in the Bezhin Meadow with a lost hunter . Eisenstein would later remove any direct references to Turgenev 's fiction , aside from the title , from the film . It is a part of A Sportsman 's Sketches , a collection of short stories . 
 Morozov 's life and death in the village of <unk> in the Ural Mountains , has no connection with Turgenev 's literary work . Morozov was a 13 @-@ year @-@ old boy who denounced his father , a kulak , to the Soviet government authorities , and was in turn killed by his family . It was a Soviet morality tale : opposing the state was selfish and reactionary , and the state was more important than family . The most popular account of the Morozov story is as follows : born to poor peasants in <unk> , a small village 350 kilometres ( 220 mi ) north @-@ east of Sverdlovsk , Morozov was a dedicated communist who led the Young Pioneers at his school , and supported Stalin 's collectivization of farms . In 1932 , at age 13 , Morozov reported his father to the political police ( GPU ) . Morozov 's father , the Chairman of the Village Soviet or <unk> , was alleged to have been " forging documents and selling them to the bandits and enemies of the Soviet State " ( as his sentence read ) . The elder Morozov , Trofim , was sentenced to 10 years in a labor camp , and later executed . However , Pavlik 's family did not approve of the young boy 's actions . On September 3 of that year , his uncle , grandfather , grandmother and a cousin murdered him , along with his younger brother . All of them except the uncle were rounded up by the GPU , convicted , and sentenced to " the highest measure of social defense " , execution by a firing squad . 
 The Morozov story was developed into compulsory children 's readings , songs , plays , a symphonic poem , a full @-@ length opera and six biographies . There is very little original evidence related to the story ; much of it is hearsay provided by second @-@ hand witnesses . In Bezhin Meadow , the child is named Stepok , departing from the original historical lore and information . Among the ironies of Bezhin Meadow 's history were that Pavlik Morozov may not have even been a member of the Young Pioneers . Morozov had been called a " disturbed young boy " who was unaware of the consequences of what he was doing and turned his father in to the authorities for having abandoned his mother for a younger woman , rather than for political reasons .

 Herbert Marshall argued that by 1931 , government interference in Soviet artistic work was already well established , in various forms : from peers of the artists , guided by ' above ' ; from " the different circles competent to judge it " ; and ultimately from the Communist Party and Stalin himself . This all led to the failed production of Bezhin Meadow . 
 Before production of the film began , the script by Aleksandr <unk> was well received by Eisenstein , but there were initial concerns about the quality of the plot and characterization involved . The commission for the production was issued by the Communist Youth League , or Komsomol , to honor their efforts in supporting collective farm work , and was to focus on " the socialist reconstruction of the countryside " . Filming began in the middle of 1935 , and in October 1935 the first developed film was presented to the Mosfilm Studio , which was producing Bezhin Meadow . The studio requested changes , and production continued . In August 1936 , with most of the principal filming done , Boris Shumyatsky , the then @-@ head of the Soviet <unk> ( Principal Directorate for the Cinema ) ordered a halt in production and directed that the film be re @-@ written . The script was again revised , with Eisenstein acknowledging errors in his production after a further version was rejected by the studio . During the creation of Bezhin Meadow , Eisenstein did not widely screen footage of the film for review . 
 Production on the unreleased film cost 2 million rubles , and spanned two years . When casting the production , Eisenstein had preferred to not use professional actors , instead using people who represented " types " to play a given role . Two thousand young boys were auditioned during the search for the ideal young actor to play the part of Stepok , the renamed Morozov character . Filming took place in many locations , primarily in Moscow studios , and remote locations in the Ukraine and the Caucasus . During production , Eisenstein had the foresight to save the edited @-@ out frames from every shot in the film , which allowed for the later reconstruction of Bezhin Meadows in the 1960s , even though the original prints were destroyed . 
 The Central Executive Committee of the Communist Party required that it screen and approve Bezhin Meadow before its release . Multiple versions of the film were banned by the Committee , which cited them as " inartistic and politically bankrupt " , and claimed that Eisenstein " confused the class struggle with the struggle between good and evil " . By an order from the Chief Directorate of Soviet Cinema , production of the film was stopped permanently on March 17 , 1937 . Shumyatsky complained that Eisenstein had presented the conflicts of the film in somewhat Biblical terms , rather than placing the conflicts of the film in the context of the socialist class struggle . Eisenstein himself would later say that the murder of Stepok by his father was " reminiscent of Abraham 's sacrifice of Isaac " . 
 After the film 's final rejection , Shumyatsky took responsibility for the failure in the Soviet media , with an essay detailing the film 's history in Pravda . According to Shumyatsky , Bezhin Meadow was a slander against the Soviet countryside , and an example of Formalism that needed to be eliminated . Shumyatsky went on to say , " [ Eisenstein was ] making Bezhin Meadow only because it offered him an opportunity to indulge in formalistic exercises . Instead of creating a strong , clear , direct work , Eisenstein detached his work from reality , from the colors and heroism of reality . He consciously reduced the work 's ideological content . " Shumyatsky would lose his government position two years later , when he was charged with being an English spy , arrested , and shot . One of the reasons Shumyatsky gave for shutting down production of Bezhin Meadow was that Eisenstein was wasting money and resources in producing it ; conversely , before his execution , Shumyatsky himself was charged with wasting money and resources by cancelling films such as Bezhin Meadow . The suppression of Bezhin Meadow was also said to be part of an ongoing campaign against the artistic avant @-@ garde in Joseph Stalin 's Russia . 
 Following the order to stop production of the film from the Soviet government and Shumyatsky , Eisenstein contracted smallpox , followed afterwards by influenza , and the film was destined to remain unfinished . He worked further on the story with the Soviet author Isaac Babel , but no material was ever published or released from their collaboration , and the production of Bezhin Meadow came to an end . The unfinished and unreleased film reels were destroyed during a World War II bombing raid in 1941 . In a later published response to Shumyatsky titled " The Mistakes of Bezhin Meadow " , Eisenstein pledged he would " rid myself of the last anarchistic traits of individualism in my outlook and creative method " . Eisenstein finally wrote , " What caused catastrophe to overtake the picture I had worked on for two years ? What was the mistaken viewpoint which , despite honesty of feelings and devotion to work , brought the production to a perversion of reality , making it politically insubstantial and consequently inartistic ? " 
 = = Reactions and legacy = = 
 Eisenstein 's Bezhin Meadow has had a rich legacy of responses and criticism since its original production . In the wake of Shumyatsky 's statements in Pravda , which diminished Eisenstein 's reputation in the Soviet Union to the lowest point in his career , others soon weighed in . Some criticism of the film was that it was too abstract or formalist , echoing Shumyatsky 's views . Ilya <unk> called the film and Eisenstein 's methods " profoundly hostile to socialism " , and faulted Eisenstein for presenting enemies in a possibly favorable light . According to Nikolai Otten , Eisenstein 's failure was due to filming an emotional scenario , thinking it freed him from studio control . Boris <unk> , the chief of Mosfilm Studio ( the producers of the film ) , took responsibility for the production 's failure , and for not controlling Eisenstein 's work or halting filming earlier ; <unk> was later arrested for this . Ivan <unk> felt that Eisenstein did not want to be a " Soviet person " , giving this as a reason for the failure of the film . David Maryan , another director , blamed Eisenstein for looking down on others , taking no pleasure in the achievements of others , and for being a loner . Eisenstein 's political status came under attack as well due to the film . G. <unk> , of the Principal Directorate for the Cinema , questioned whether Eisenstein should be free to work with film students due to his political unreliability . 
 Not all of the commentary and examination of Bezhin Meadow was overtly negative , however . In the years after the film closed its production , studios and film organizations in major Russian cities including Moscow , Leningrad , and Kiev held seminars to examine the lessons of the film , with some of the sessions lasting days . A former student of Eisenstein , <unk> Pavlenko , defended Eisenstein 's work in the wake of Bezhin Meadow . Grigori Alexandrov , a filmmaker Eisenstein with whom had worked previously , was denounced for " raising himself above the community " because he did not speak out against his associate . <unk> <unk> suggested that as Eisenstein was not present in the USSR during the First Five @-@ Year Plan , he was unable to correctly present modern political lessons . The set @-@ piece in Bezhin Meadow where the villagers desecrate the village church in response to Stepok 's death , which was removed in later versions of the film , has been called " one of the great set @-@ pieces in cinema " , and a further demonstration of the Biblical imagery featured in the film . Among such visuals from the desecration sequence were an image of a girl in a mirror , framed as the Virgin Mary , and a statue of a crucified Christ held as if it were in a pietà . Ivor Montagu likened Eisenstein 's struggles with the film to Galileo 's conflict with the Inquisition . In spite of the heavy criticisms he faced , Eisenstein was allowed by the politburo to continue his career , and he created and released the film Alexander Nevsky in 1938 . 
 In the 1960s , it was learned that Eisenstein 's wife , Pera <unk> , had saved splices of film from the editing table that was used for Bezhin Meadow . Starting in 1964 , a reconstruction of the film was created and set to a musical score by Sergei Prokofiev by Russian film director Sergei <unk> with Eisenstein scholar Naum Kleiman . The film was edited to the original script , to preserve the original cutting continuity ; new intertitles were also created from the script , and a new spoken introduction was added . The film now exists as a 35 @-@ minute " silent film slide show " . In 1988 , the filming of Bezhin Meadow was the focus of a retrospective at the Tisch School of the Arts in New York City . Entitled " Jay Leyda : A Life 's Work " , it focused on Leyda , a professor at the school and the lone American to have studied with Eisenstein at the Moscow State Film Institute ; Leyda had been apprentice director and still photographer on the set . Of the Soviet films from the 1920s and 1930s , Bezhin Meadow is the one that may be most cited in academic works related to film study . 
 Though production of Bezhin Meadow was never completed , and a full version was never distributed , the film was later considered a celebration of Soviet political purposes and informants . In spite of the problems that Bezhin Meadow faced , Eisenstein would receive the Order of Lenin in 1939 due to the wild success of Alexander Nevsky . In 1941 , he became the artistic director of Mosfilm Studios . 
 = Modern Cookery for Private Families = 
 Modern Cookery for Private Families is an English cookery book by Eliza Acton ( 1799 – 1859 ) . It was first published by Longmans in 1845 , and was a best @-@ seller , running through 13 editions by 1853 , though its sales were later eclipsed by Mrs Beeton . On the strength of the book , Delia Smith called Acton " the best writer of recipes in the English language " , and in the same vein Elizabeth David called Modern Cookery " the greatest cookery book in our language " . 
 It was one of the first cookery books to provide lists of ingredients , exact quantities , and cooking times , and to include Eastern recipes for chutneys . Its first edition was the first book to refer to Christmas pudding . 
 Acton 's recipes and writing style have been admired by cooks including Elizabeth David , Delia Smith and Jane Grigson ; Clarissa Dickson Wright praises her writing but criticises her increasing conformity to Victorian dullness . 
 = = Book = = 
 The book was the result of several years of research , prompted by Longman , who had published Acton 's Poems . Many of the recipes came from her friends . Modern Cookery quickly became a bestselling work , appearing in several editions and remaining a standard cookery book throughout the rest of the century . The book was immensely influential , establishing the format for modern cookery book writing , by listing the exact ingredients required for each recipe , the time needed , and potential problems that might arise . This was a major departure from previous cookbooks , which were less precise . 
 The book was one of the first to list recipes for Eastern " <unk> " , both fresh , like her " Mauritian shrimp <unk> " with lemon and oil , and preserved , like her " Bengal <unk> " with raisins , crab apples , garlic , and ginger . The first known mention of Christmas pudding , too , is in the first edition of 1845 ; the dish had earlier been known simply as plum pudding . Her recipe for mincemeat ( as in mince pies ) still contained meat – she suggests ox tongue or beef sirloin – which she combined with lemons " boiled quite tender and chopped up entirely with the exception of the pips " . 
 The book remained in print for over 50 years through most of the Victorian era , but it is Mrs Beeton 's book , first published in 1861 , which is now remembered from that period . 
 The title varied somewhat over the years ; the 1845 edition 's full title was 
 Modern Cookery , In All Its Branches : Reduced to a System of Easy Practice , for the Use of Private Families . In a Series of Practical Receipts , Which Have Been Strictly Tested , And are Given with the Most Minute exactness . 
 By 1860 , the title had become 
 Modern Cookery , For Private Families , Reduced to a System of Easy Practice , In a Series of Carefully Tested Receipts , In Which the Principles of Baron Liebig and Other Eminent Writers Have Been as Much as Possible Applied and Explained . 
 = = = Contents = = = 
 The following list refers to the 1860 edition . 
 = = = Approach = = = 
 Acton 's book is divided into chapters with brief , often single word titles such as " Fish " . In a marked departure from eighteenth century English cookery books like Hannah Glasse 's The Art of Cookery , these are written as connected wholes . The chapter on fish begins with an essay on how to choose fish for freshness ; there follows some advice on how to bake fish , and on the kinds of fat best used for frying fish . Suitable pans are illustrated . The recipes follow ; these too are written as stories rather than simply as instructions . Where appropriate , recipes end with a list of ingredients , as well as the cooking time , in marked change from eighteenth century practice . Recipes are grouped , in the case of fish by species , and they form a connected story . Acton adds comments where she sees fit , indicating anything from when the food is in season to where a recipe came from , and how much she likes it . For example , she begins her account of the John Dory with a recipe which is more of an introductory essay than a set of instructions , though given the simplicity of the recipe , it says all that a cook would need to know on the matter : 
 TO <unk> A JOHN <unk> . 
 [ In best season from Michaelmas to Christmas , but good all the year ] 
 The John Dory , though of uninviting appearance , is considered by some persons as the most delicious fish that appears at table ; in the general estimation , however , it ranks next to the turbot , but it is far less abundant in our waters , and is not commonly to be procured of sufficient size for a handsome dish , except in some few parts of our coast which are celebrated for it . It may easily be known by its yellow gray colour , its one large dark spot on either side , the long filaments on the back , a general thickness of form , and its very ugly head . It is dressed in the same manner , and served usually with the same sauces as a turbot , but requires less time to boil it . The fins should be cut off before it is cooked . 
 Acton follows this with an actual recipe , again characteristically simple , and with one of her brief parenthetical asides , at once modestly claiming ownership and praising the dish : 
 SMALL JOHN <unk> <unk> . 
 ( Author 's Receipt — good . ) 
 We have found these fish when they were too small to be worth cooking in the usual way , excellent when quite simply baked in the following manner , the flesh being remarkably sweet and tender , much more so than it becomes by frying or broiling . After they have been cleaned , dry them in a cloth , season the insides slightly with fine salt , dredge a little flour on the fish , and stick a few very small bits of butter on them , but only just sufficient to prevent their becoming dry in the oven ; lay them singly on a flat dish , and bake them very gently from fourteen to sixteen minutes . Serve them with the same sauce as baked soles . 
 When extremely fresh , as it usually is in the markets of the coast , fish thus simply dressed au four is preferable to that more elaborately prepared by adding various condiments to it after it is placed in a deep dish , and covering it with a thick layer of bread crumbs , moistened with clarified butter . 
 The appearance of the John <unk> is improved by taking off the heads , and cutting away not only the fins but the filaments of the back . 
 = = = Illustrations = = = 
 The book was from the first edition onwards illustrated with a large number of small woodcuts . Some show cookware , like the pot used to serve Bouillon or the " Mackerel Kettle " , a deep oval saucepan with a lid , used to cook fish ; some illustrate produce as the housekeeper would see it in the market , like the engravings of poultry and fish — educating the reader in the recognition of gurnard , sea bream , plaice , grey mullet , garfish , and sand @-@ eel ; others show finished dishes , like the Lady 's <unk> or a moulded jelly , " tastefully garnished with preserved , or with fresh fruit . "

 Delia Smith called Acton " the best writer of recipes in the English language " . Elizabeth David similarly called Modern Cookery " the greatest cookery book in our language " . Bee Wilson , writing in The Telegraph , agrees that it is " the greatest British cookbook of all time " , adding that Acton deserves to be a household name : 
 Elizabeth David , asking why " this peerless writer " was eclipsed by " imitators so limited in experience , and in capacity of expression so inferior ? " She answers her own question with the suggestion that Acton , born in 1799 , was " in taste and in spirit , a child of the eighteenth century . " David notes that the year after Modern Cookery was first published , Bird 's Custard Powder was launched : " What we know as modern cookery , and it had little to do with Eliza Acton 's version , was on its way . " And she points out that manuals like Mrs Beeton 's , which in later editions were edited and re @-@ written by other hands , existed to allow cooks to look up recipes , rather than to read cookery books . She concludes that " A book such as Miss Acton 's , written as a coherent whole , is essentially one to be read , as it is written , with intelligence and understanding and application . " 
 She dispenses her sly wit sparingly , like truffles . ' The Publisher 's Pudding ' , we are told , ' can scarcely be made too rich ' ( it is studded with Jordan almonds and <unk> raisins ) in contrast to ' The Poor Author 's Pudding ' , a modest bread @-@ and @-@ butter affair . 
 Bee Wilson argues that the greatness of the book comes from " Acton 's very British sensibility . She calls a spade a spade , noting that some of the coffee served on the newfangled railway lines was a ' commercial disgrace ' . " Wilson adds that Acton has both honesty and reticence : she does not " gush " when she really likes something , " but puts it in brackets , as if holding her emotions in . ' Lemon <unk> ( Light and Good ) ' , for example . Or ' Mushrooms Au Beurre ( Delicious ) ' ... that makes her Eliza Acton ( The Best ) . " 
 Elizabeth Ray , editor of The Best of Eliza Acton — a selection of recipes from Modern Cookery with an introduction by Elizabeth David , notes that Acton began her writing career with poetry , only to be told by her publishers that a cookery book would be better , and that " an unmistakable literary talent appears even in her receipts , in the style itself , and in the engaging titles she bestows on some of her dishes " , which include " The Elegant Economist 's Pudding " as well as those of publishers and authors . 
 Clarissa Dickson Wright , in her A History of English Food , calls Acton " the best cookery writer of the period " , noting that she paid " considerable attention " to curry in the book . Dickson Wright comments that Acton knew about " her countrymen " ' s lack of understanding of curry and " lamented ' the great superiority of the oriental curries over those generally prepared in England ' " . She further notes that Acton suggested practical improvements , such as grating coconut into the gravy , and using tamarind , acid apples and cucumber to simulate the " piquancy you get with bitter gourds , mango , and so on " , which she comments was certainly better than lazily adding lemon juice , but still nothing like " anything prepared by my grandmother 's Indian cook . " 
 Dickson Wright also comments on the early signs in Modern Cookery of what she considers the increasing dullness of Victorian cookery . Although she finds Acton " in most respects an admirable cookery writer " , she observes that between the first and the third editions Acton has gone from using garlic sparingly to avoiding it entirely . She is equally scathing about Acton 's " Burlington <unk> " which she calls " basically a dish of brawn " ; she argues that the Victorians were too fond of it , and that Acton 's recipe is " the epitome of dull food dressed up to look whimsical . " 
 Sue Dyson and Roger McShane , reviewing the book on <unk> , call it the " very antithesis " of the elaborate haute cuisine of Marie @-@ Antoine Carême , and note that it was one of the first cookery books to provide quantities , timings , and lists of ingredients . They find the recipe for <unk> soup " wonderful " , the oyster sausages " very tasty " , and the " Potato <unk> " like a French equivalent of <unk> . But " the section that really caught our interest " was puddings and desserts . They conclude that " this is an inspirational book with an Aladdin 's Cave of recipes and wonderful , timeless writing " and an " absolutely essential part of any serious cookbook collection . " 
 Kathryn Hughes , writing in The Guardian , observes that Acton has been set up as " the saint to Mrs Beeton 's sinner " , " an <unk> heroine : a stylish Regency spinster , a poet rather than a journalist , a committed cookery writer rather than an opportunistic hack . " She notes that Elizabeth David created this image , supported by Jane Grigson , and Delia Smith : " in short , anyone who wants to be in the kitchen cool gang knows that the name to drop is Acton 's . " She agrees that Mrs Beeton " pinched " Acton 's recipes , along with those of other authors , because they were " rather good " . She notes the " elegant tilt of Acton 's writing " and its " sly humour " , as well as the accuracy of the recipes , very unlike eighteenth @-@ century vagueness , and calls Acton " an admirable pioneer " . 
 Natalie Whittle , writing in the Financial Times in 2011 , describes how recipes such as " Water Souchy " ( a clear fish soup ) from Modern Cookery and other books of the period are being revived at English restaurants . 
 Simon Hopkinson , writing in The Independent in 2000 , praises Acton 's Christmas pudding : " It was to the cookery writing of the legendary Eliza Acton where Joyce Molyneux [ of the Carved Angel ] went to find her perfect pudding recipe . And , as far as I remember , the particular reason why she liked the result of Acton 's recipe above all others was because it had this unusual lightness to it , yet also seemed to offer up the required richness too . " 
 The Tonbridge Historical Society note that " by 1827 Eliza was living in Tonbridge at No. 1 <unk> ... Not surprisingly there are many references to Kent and some to Tonbridge in Eliza 's recipes . There is ' Kentish ' sausage meat , suet pudding and cherry jam , ' Tonbridge ' brawn , and ‘ <unk> ’ Veal cake , preserved ham and bread . "

 Against All Odds ( 2005 ) was a professional wrestling pay @-@ per @-@ view ( PPV ) event produced by Total Nonstop Action Wrestling ( TNA ) , which took place on February 13 , 2005 at the TNA Impact ! Zone in Orlando , Florida . It was the first event under the Against All Odds chronology . Eight matches were featured on the event 's card . 
 The main event was for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship between the champion , Jeff Jarrett , and the challenger , Kevin Nash , in which Jarrett won to retain the championship . Another featured match was an Iron Man match for the TNA X Division Championship , in which the wrestler with the most scoring conditions after thirty minutes would win . The champion , A.J. Styles , defeated the challenger , Christopher Daniels , to retain the championship in this match . Multiple bouts were scheduled on the undercard . One saw Abyss defeat Jeff Hardy in a match where the competitors had to climb a ladder and retrieve an envelope to become number one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship , in what is called a Full Metal Mayhem match . The other being for the NWA World Tag Team Championship between the champions , America 's Most Wanted ( Chris Harris and James Storm ) ( AMW ) , and Kid Kash and Lance Hoyt ; AMW claimed victory in the match . 
 The event marked the debut of the Full Metal Mayhem match , which later became one of TNA 's most successful match types . The professional wrestling section of the Canadian Online Explorer website rated the entire event a 7 out of 10 stars , which was the same rating as the 2006 event . 
 = = Background = = 
 The event featured eight professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre @-@ existing scripted feuds , plots , and storylines . Wrestlers were portrayed as either villains or heroes in the scripted events that built tension and culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches . 
 The main event at Against All Odds was a standard wrestling match for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship , in which Jeff Jarrett defended the championship against his on @-@ screen rival Kevin Nash . The bout was announced on the January 21 episode of TNA 's primary television program , TNA Impact ! , during a pre @-@ taped press conference . On the February 11 episode of Impact ! , authority figure Dusty Rhodes added the stipulation that if Jarrett used a guitar ( a weapon he often used to win his matches ) during the match , he would be automatically disqualified and would lose the NWA World Heavyweight Championship to Nash even if the referee did not see him use it . 
 Another storyline rivalry heading into Against All Odds was for the TNA X Division Championship between the champion , A.J. Styles , and the challenger , Christopher Daniels , in a thirty @-@ minute Iron Man match . An Iron Man match involves two competitors fighting for a predetermined amount of time , in this case thirty @-@ minutes , after which whoever gained more pinfalls or submissions is the victor . The rivalry for this match began on the January 21 episode of Impact ! , when Daniels challenged Styles to a match that night , in which if Styles could not defeat him in under ten @-@ minutes then Daniels got a X Division Championship match at Against All Odds . The match ended in a time limit draw , which meant per the pre @-@ match stipulation Daniels gained a championship match at Against All Odds . Dusty Rhodes then entered the arena after the match and announced that the contest would be a thirty @-@ minute Iron Man match . 
 A featured match heading into Against All Odds was the debuting of Full Metal Mayhem , in which Abyss fought Jeff Hardy , with the winner becoming number one contender to the NWA World Heavyweight Championship . In a Full Metal Mayhem match , two or more competitors fight to either gain a pinfall , submission , or climb a ladder to retrieve an envelope or a championship belt in no disqualification rules . In this particular one there were two envelopes , one with a contract for the championship match , while the other one was empty . At TNA 's previous PPV , Final Resolution , Abyss attacked Hardy after his match with Scott Hall . On the January 21 episode of Impact ! , Abyss attacked Hardy once again and this time by slamming him through a table . On the January 28 episode of Impact ! , TNA advertised the debut of Full Metal Mayhem between Hardy and Abyss at Against All Odds . On the February 4 episode of Impact ! , the second stipulation of the match was announced , that the winner would gain a future championship match on a future edition of Impact ! . 
 In the tag team division , the reigning NWA World Tag Team Champions America 's Most Wanted ( Chris Harris and James Storm ) defended the championship against the team of Kid Kash and Lance Hoyt . This match was the result of a challenge issued by Kash and Hoyt on the January 21 episode of Impact ! to AMW to defend the championship against them at Against All Odds , which AMW accepted .

Skipper followed by covering Williams for the pinfall . 
 The following bout was a tag team match between the team of B.G. James and Jeff Hammond and Michael Shane and Kazarian . James and Hammond were the victors in the encounter after Hammond dropped onto Kazarian with his elbow cocked to gain the pinfall . 
 The third contest pitted Raven against Dustin Rhodes in a standard match . After a few minutes of fighting , Raven pinned Rhodes with a roll @-@ up style pin @-@ attempt . 
 The NWA World Tag Team Championship was on the line in the encounter between the champions , America 's Most Wanted ( Chris Harris and James Storm ) , and Kid Kash and Lance Hoyt . The match ended when America 's Most Wanted performed their finishing maneuver the Death Sentence , which saw Storm wrap his arms around Hoyt and squeeze tightly while Harris jumped off the top turnbuckle and performed a legdrop across his neck and head . America 's Most Wanted followed by covering Hoyt to retain the World Tag Team Championship .

 The fifth contest was a Full Metal Mayhem match for a future match on Impact ! for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship . Early in the match , Abyss placed two tables side @-@ by @-@ side and then stacked two more on top of those at ringside . Mid @-@ way through the match , Hardy grabbed Abyss and placed him on a table at the top of the entrance ramp , he then ascended to the roof of the entrance ramp and performed a front @-@ flip , landing on Abyss in a move Hardy calls the Swanton Bomb . In the final minutes of the match , Hardy climbed a ladder and retrieved one of the envelopes , however , it was empty which meant the last one held the future championship match . Hardy then tried to move the ladder and retrieve the second envelope . While he was climbing again , Abyss grabbed him and pulled him down , he then threw Hardy against the ropes . When Hardy connected with the ropes , he flipped over them and crashed through the four tables set up earlier in the match . Abyss followed by climbing the ladder and removing the envelope to win the match . 
 The next bout was between the team of Diamond Dallas Page ( DDP ) and Monty Brown and Team Canada ( Bobby Roode and Eric Young ) , who were accompanied by Coach D 'Amore and Johnny Devine . DDP and Brown were the winners of the contest after DDP grabbed Young around the head and neck , jumped forward and landed on his back to force Young 's face into the mat and his shoulder . DDP followed by covering Young for the pinfall and the win . 
 The TNA X Division Championship was contested for in an Iron Man match in the seventh match , as then @-@ champion , A.J. Styles , defended the title against Christopher Daniels . The first fall of the match came when Daniels pinned Styles following bending Styles forward , placing Styles ' head between his legs , tucked Styles ' arms behind Styles ' back , lifted him up , turned 90 ° , and dropped to the mat to force Styles ' face into the mat in what Daniels dubbed the Angel 's Wings . Styles scored the second fall by pinning Daniels with a roll @-@ up , tying the match one fall apiece . Before the deciding fall to break the tie could take place , the thirty @-@ minute time limit ran out . Daniels then demanded the match go into overtime / sudden death , which he was granted by Dusty Rhodes . The deciding pinfall saw Styles grab Daniels , lift him up , hold him upside down , trap Daniels ' arms behind his legs , and jump forward to implant Daniels entire body into the mat in a move Styles dubbed the Styles Clash to retain the X Division Championship . 
 The main event was for the NWA World Heavyweight Championship , in which defending champion , Jeff Jarrett , fought Kevin Nash . During the match , since Jarrett couldn 't use his trademark guitar , Jarrett used a similar instrument , a cello . Jarrett went to hit Nash with the cello , however it broke before he could swing it . Later , Nash grabbed the broken cello and placed it on the canvass . He then followed by lifting up Jarrett onto his shoulders and dropping him onto the cello to perform what he dubbed the Jackknife Powerbomb . While lifting Jarrett , Nash accidentally knocked out the referee , according to the script . With the referee unconscious , no one could count the pinfall . Monty Sopp then made his debut in TNA and attacked Nash , which led to a fight between the two . After the conclusion to the brawl , referee 's tried to remove Sopp from the ringside area . Sean Waltman then made his debut in TNA and attacked Jarrett , which also led to a fight between them . A while later the match came to an end , when Jarrett hit Nash in the groin , grabbed him , and tripped him , which caused him to fall and force his face into the canvass , which completed Jarrett 's finishing maneuver the Stroke . Jarrett then covered Nash for the pinfall victory and to retain the NWA World Heavyweight Championship .

 See also List of battalions of the King 's Regiment ( Liverpool ) 
 The King 's Regiment ( Liverpool ) was one of the oldest line infantry regiments of the British Army , having been formed in 1685 and numbered as the 8th ( The King 's ) Regiment of Foot in 1751 . Unlike most British Army infantry regiments , which were associated with a county , the King 's represented the city of Liverpool , one of only four regiments affiliated to a city in the British Army . After 273 years of continuous existence , the regiment was amalgamated with the Manchester Regiment in 1958 to form the King 's Regiment ( Liverpool and Manchester ) , which was later amalgamated with the King 's Own Royal Border Regiment and the Queen 's Lancashire Regiment to form the present Duke of Lancaster 's Regiment ( King 's , Lancashire and Border ) . 
 The King 's notably saw active service in the Second Boer War , the two world wars , and the Korean War . In the First World War , the regiment contributed dozens of battalions to the Western Front , Salonika , and the North West Frontier . More than 13 @,@ 000 men were killed . In the Second World War , the 5th and 8th ( Irish ) battalions landed during Operation Overlord , the 1st and 13th fought as Chindits in the Burma Campaign , and the 2nd Battalion served in Italy and Greece . The King 's later fought in the Korean War , earning the regiment 's last battle honour . 
 Nine Victoria Crosses were awarded to men of the regiment , the first in 1900 and the last in 1918 . An additional two were awarded to Royal Army Medical Corps officer Noel Godfrey Chavasse , who was attached to the 10th ( Scottish ) Battalion during the Great War . 
 In peacetime , the regiment 's battalions were based in the United Kingdom and colonies in the British Empire . Duties varied : riots were suppressed in Belfast , England , and the Middle East ; bases were garrisoned in places such as the North @-@ West Frontier Province and West Germany ; and reviews and parades conducted throughout the regiment 's history . 
 = = Colonial wars ( 1881 – 1914 ) = = 
 The Cardwell – Childers reforms from the 1860s to the 1880s substantially reorganised the British Army , principally by amalgamating single @-@ battalion regiments to form regiments of multiple battalions . The King 's , which already had two regular battalions , did not amalgamate , but did adopt a new title on the numbering system 's abolition . Thus , on 1 July 1881 , the two battalions of the 8th ( The King 's ) Regiment of Foot became the 1st and 2nd Battalions , The King 's ( Liverpool ) Regiment . The 8th Foot had been associated with Liverpool since 1873 , when it became allocated to the town 's 13th Brigade Depot . Regular regiments gained auxiliary battalions through the integration of the militia and volunteers , of which nine from Lancashire and the Isle of Man transferred to the King 's and ultimately became part of the Special Reserve and Territorial Force . 
 Under the new system , it was envisaged that one regular battalion would be based in the United Kingdom and one overseas . The 1st Battalion had been in North West England since the late 1870s and had been bombed while based at Salford Barracks in 1881 . The attack had been the first in a dynamite campaign instigated by the Irish Republican Jeremiah O 'Donovan Rossa . The barracks sustained only minor structural damage from the explosion , which killed a child and badly wounded its mother . Soon afterwards , rioting during mineworkers ' strikes in Chowbent , Wigan , and Warrington required the battalion 's intervention to prevent further disorder . In 1882 , the battalion moved to Ireland , based in the Curragh . During the otherwise uneventful posting , the 1st responded to riots in Belfast . The sectarian disorder coincided with the introduction of the 1886 Home Rule Bill in the British Parliament . The battalion returned to England three years later . 
 The 2nd King 's had been on the Indian subcontinent since 1877 and had fought in the Second Afghan War . The Third Burmese War punctuated the battalion 's overseas service in the 1880s . Intent on deposing Upper Burma 's King Thibaw and imposing imperial rule , Britain issued an ultimatum consisting of demands that were rejected as anticipated . The invasion began in November 1885 in the form of the Burma Field Force , which progressed up the Irrawaddy River via transports , enabling the rapid capture of frontier forts and the capital Mandalay . After the capital 's seizure , the battalion provided an escort that oversaw the exile of Thibaw . A guerrilla campaign against the British followed the completion of Upper Burma 's annexation on 1 January 1886 , lasting for at least five years . For more than a year , the King 's operated in small groups pursuing guerrillas in the Burmese jungle . Casualties numbered 12 officers and 256 men by the time the battalion had returned to India . In early 1900 the 2nd Battalion Liverpool Regiment was stationed at Gibraltar . 
 Overseas service for the 1st King 's included a two @-@ year residence in Nova Scotia , beginning in 1893 . In January 1895 , the battalion provided a 100 @-@ man guard of honour when the body of Canadian Prime Minister John Thompson was returned from Britain . The battalion subsequently became stationed in the West Indies , then Cape Colony in 1897 . The Second Boer War began two years later . Prior to the outbreak of the war , as the discord between the British and Boer republics escalated , the 1st King 's formed a company of mounted infantry and underwent intensive training at Ladysmith , Natal Colony . War was declared on 11 October and Natal invaded by a Boer force under General Piet Joubert . General George White held authority over 13 @,@ 000 British personnel dispersed throughout Natal . Heavy losses were incurred by the British in the first major engagements of the war , at <unk> Hill and <unk> . Retreat to Ladysmith , where the British concentrated its largest contingent , ensued . Having besieged Kimberley and <unk> , Boers converged upon Ladysmith and positioned artillery pieces on surrounding hills overlooking the town . 
 On 30 October , General White ordered an attack on northern Boer positions . White 's plans were described as vague , ambitious , and complicated , and the battle proved a disaster that became known to the British as " <unk> Monday " . The 1st King 's were allocated to Colonel Grimwood 's column , which intended to advance on and secure Long Hill , believed to constitute the Boer 's left flank . Unbeknownst to Grimwood , almost half of the brigade separated from the column during the night march while following a rightward deviation by the artillery batteries , including the oblivious 1st King 's and Royal Dublin Fusiliers . In the morning light , the brigade discovered that its right flank was exposed by the distance of John French 's cavalry and that Long Hill was unoccupied . Grimwood and French 's men became pinned down by heavy rifle and artillery fire . Amidst rumours of an attack against the town being imminent and failure evident , White ordered the column to retreat at noon . The artillery provided cover during the chaos that followed and prevented greater loss of life . At Nicholson 's Nek , to the north @-@ west of Long Hill , the Boers took more than 1 @,@ 000 prisoner . 
 The Boers enclosed Ladysmith on 2 November , beginning a 118 @-@ day siege . The King 's , commanded by Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Llewelyn Mellor , became assigned to the north @-@ eastern defensive sector under Colonel Knox , a disciplinarian who instituted a programme of fortification development in his area . Construction of the defences occurred mostly at night , although rain , oppressive heat , and cold limited the opportunity to rest . On 6 January , the King 's mounted infantry helped repulse a Boer attempt to penetrate the southern perimeter . By late January , the scarcity of supplies had become particularly acute . Disease pervaded while the town resorted to consuming the garrison 's horses and mules . 
 Reinforcements began to arrive in South Africa in November under General Redvers Buller . The relief of the three besieged garrisons became the general 's priority . He divided his corps and assumed personal command of the Ladysmith expedition . The relief effort was hindered by three successive defeats in December , termed by the British as " Black Week " , and further reverses in January and early February . The siege of Ladysmith ended on 28 February . The King 's then gained a volunteer company and had its mounted infantry absorbed by an MI battalion . 
 Britain eventually extended its prosecution of the war into the Orange Free State and Transvaal Republic . On 21 August , at Van Wyk 's <unk> , Sergeant Hampton and Corporal Knight held their positions and evacuated wounded mounted Kingsmen under heavy fire , for which they received the Victoria Cross . Two days later , Boer forces attacked the 1st Battalion while it was at the forefront of an advance south of <unk> . The protracted engagement ended when the King 's were ordered to withdraw , having almost expended their ammunition . Casualties exceeded 70 , while Private Heaton earned the Victoria Cross . 
 The nominal annexation of the Orange Free State and Transvaal Republic in May and September did not resolve the war . Instead , the Boer commandos transitioned to guerrilla warfare and resisted the British until 1902 . The King 's concentrated in the Eastern Transvaal , where Boers under Botha and Viljoen operated . Detachments occupied networks of blockhouses and provided complements for armoured trains . One such detachment was overwhelmed at Helvetia on 29 December . Situated near the Lydenburg – <unk> railway , Helvetia was garrisoned primarily by a contingent of the King 's equipped with a 4 @.@ 7 @-@ in gun nicknamed " Lady Roberts " . The nocturnal attack , conducted in fog , yielded considerable success for the Boers with scores of prisoners taken and the gun captured . Only King 's Kopje withstood the attack . The circumstances were controversial and a general court @-@ martial later sentenced Major Stapleton Cotton , who ordered the surrender , to be cashiered and dismissed from the army . Author Arthur Conan Doyle publicly questioned the decision and contended that the wounds Major Cotton sustained merited " some revision " of the officer 's sentence . 
 The Boer War provided the first opportunity for the regiment 's volunteer battalions to serve overseas with regular forces , supplying individual detachments and service companies . The militia battalions , numbered the 5th and 6th during the war , contrastingly deployed to South Africa intact late in the conflict . A memorial sculpted by William <unk> John to commemorate the regiment 's service in Afghanistan , Burma , and South Africa was erected in St John 's Gardens , Liverpool and unveiled by Field Marshal Sir George White on 9 September 1905 .

 = = = 1914 – 1915 = = = 
 The regiment fielded at least 49 battalions during the First World War , from a pre @-@ war establishment of two regular , two militia , and six territorial . Of those battalions , 26 served abroad , receiving 58 battle honours and six Victoria Crosses for service on the Western Front , the Balkans , India , and Russia . Some 13 @,@ 795 Kingsmen died during the course of the war , the battalions suffering an average of 615 deaths . Thousands more would be wounded , sick , or taken prisoner . Of specific formations , the four Liverpool Pals battalions had nearly 2 @,@ 800 casualties , while the 55th ( West Lancashire ) Division 's 165th ( Liverpool ) Brigade , composed entirely of battalions from the King 's , incurred 1 @,@ 672 dead , 6 @,@ 056 wounded , and 953 missing during the period of 3 January 1916 and 11 November 1918 . 
 A vigorous recruiting campaign involving pre @-@ war personalities such as Lord Kitchener and Lord Derby facilitated the rapid expansion of the British Army . Territorial units formed duplicate battalions from August 1914 to May 1915 . To differentiate them , they were , for instance , designated the 2 / 5th and 3 / 5th battalions , respectively . Second @-@ line battalions had been raised for home service and recruit training , but were ultimately dispatched to the Western Front and replaced by the third @-@ line . Driven by a conviction that the war would not be resolved quickly and seeking an alternative to the Territorial Army , Secretary of State for War Lord Kitchener appealed for an initial 100 @,@ 000 volunteers to form a " New Army " . The 17th Earl of Derby proposed forming a battalion of " Pals " for the King 's Regiment , to be recruited from men of the same workplace . His proposal proved successful . Within a week , thousands of Liverpudlians had volunteered for service , to eventually be formed into the 17th , 18th , 19th , and 20th Battalions . Collectively , the battalions became known as the City of Liverpool battalions or " Liverpool Pals " . Lord Derby addressed recruits on 28 August : 
 Mobilisation began at the onset of the war , in August 1914 , at which time the 1st King 's was based at Aldershot . Under command of Lieutenant @-@ Colonel W.S. Bannatyne , the 1st King 's boarded the SS Irrawaddy at Southampton . The battalion landed at Le Havre on 13 August with the 6th Brigade , 2nd Division , one of the original components of the British Expeditionary Force ( BEF ) . The BEF first engaged the German Army at Mons , Belgium , after which it went into a retreat that was sustained until 5 September , when the Allies resolved to stand at the Marne , a river east of Paris . Having acted as a rearguard to the 2nd Division , the 1st King 's and its brigade prevented a German force cutting off the 4th ( Guards ) Brigade , forming the rearguard at Villers @-@ <unk> , and 70th Battery , Royal Field Artillery . The brigade extricated the guns , earning it praise from the 2nd Division 's commanding officer , Major @-@ General Monro . 
 The Allies halted the German advance in the First Battle of the Marne ; the ensuing retreat , which prompted an Allied counter @-@ offensive , ended at the Aisne . After both battles had been fought , the battalion moved north to Ypres , during the so @-@ called " Race to the Sea " . In an action at Langemarck during the First Battle of Ypres , the battalion captured the small village of <unk> , just north @-@ east of Polygon Wood . As the battle progressed , the German command sought a decisive victory against the outnumbered BEF and launched First Ypres ' last major assault on 11 November . 
 Located to the south of Polygon Wood , the 1st King 's was one of only a few units available to defend British lines . A force of " 12 and a half " divisions , including a composite of the élite Prussian Guard , attacked at 0900 along a 9 miles ( 14 km ) front extending from Messines to Polygon . Some German units breached the front in places but quickly lost momentum and were gradually pushed back by a desperate defence . The Prussian Guard had advanced in dense formations , each guardsman effectively side @-@ by @-@ side and led by sword @-@ wielding officers . In the defence of Polygon Wood , the 1st King 's held on and virtually destroyed the 3rd Prussian Foot Guards with concentrated rapid @-@ fire and artillery support . By battle 's end , the 1st King 's casualties numbered 33 officers and 814 other ranks from an original strength of 27 officers and 991 other ranks . Among the battalion 's dead was Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Bannatyne , killed by a sniper on 24 October . 
 By the end of March 1915 , the King 's had eight battalions on the Western Front . The 1st and 1 / 5th participated in a " holding " attack at Givenchy designed to support the Allied offensive at Neuve Chapelle . An ineffectual preliminary bombardment failed to destroy much of the barbed wire , fatally impeding the 1st King 's . The withering hail @-@ of @-@ fire inflicted heavy casualties on the King 's , one of whom was the wounded Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Carter . A platoon under Lieutenant Miller managed to reach German lines and blockade itself in a communications trench for over an hour , under fire from Allied artillery , until withdrawing to British lines . The battalion 's casualties amounted to 61 killed , 115 wounded , and 62 missing . 
 One @-@ month later , on 24 April , a German offensive began Second Ypres , which became the 4th and 1 / 6th King 's first major battle . In the second subsidiary action of the offensive , at Saint @-@ Julien , the 4th King 's sustained more than 400 casualties over a four @-@ day period , the majority , some 374 , while supporting the 1 / 4th Gurkha Rifles on the 27th . The 1 / 6th supported 1st Cheshires in the defence of Hill 60 . After the regiment 's involvement in ' Second Ypres ' receded , four battalions fought at Festubert , collectively incurring in excess of 1 @,@ 200 casualties . Lance Corporal Tombs became the regiment 's first Victoria Cross recipient of the war for assisting wounded soldiers during the battle . The 1 / 10th Battalion fought its first battle on 16 June , in a " local " action at Bellewaarde . Losses for the Liverpool Scottish neared 400 killed , wounded and missing , with just two of 24 officers present surviving unscathed . 
 The British instigated a new offensive on 25 September , at Loos , to coincide with French offensives in the Champagne and Artois regions . The King 's were represented in the offensive by eight battalions , from standard infantry to pioneers . Some 150 tons of Chlorine gas was used on the first day of the battle , discharged via thousands of cylinders . Strong winds blew the gas backwards , hindering the advance of the 1st King 's and other units having to also contend with partially uncut barbed wire . The advance of the 1 / 9th King 's also stalled , though they took about 300 Germans prisoner . The battalion later assisted in the repulse of a German counter @-@ attack on 8 October . More battalions arrived before the year ended , including the 17th , 18th , 19th , and 20th Liverpool Pals , which formed the 89th Brigade , 30th Division . 
 = = = 1916 – 1917 = = = 
 The Liverpool Pals ' first battle came during " The Big Push " on 1 July 1916 , on the first day of the Battle of the Somme , the worst single day for casualties in British military history . The 89th Brigade , under the Earl of Derby 's brother Brigadier F.C. Stanley , still comprised the 17th , 19th , and 20th Pals , but had the 18th reassigned to the 21st Brigade in December . The 30th Division formed part of XIII Corps , which attacked towards Montauban , south of where Britain suffered the majority of its nearly 60 @,@ 000 casualties on the 1st . At 07 : 30 , the 30th Division began its advance on the left of the French Corps de Fer . Meeting limited opposition , the Pals completed their objectives with comparatively minimal casualties . Grievous losses were , however , incurred by the 18th from heavy machine @-@ gun fire during its advance towards the Glatz Redoubt . The battalion 's commanding officer , Lieutenant @-@ Colonel E.H. Trotter , killed by a shell on 8 July , intentionally underestimated the battalion 's casualties of about 500 to avoid the deployment of brigade reserves . 
 More battalions entered the fray throughout the offensive . Some 14 battalions contributed to five attempts to capture the village of Guillemont between July and September . In the early hours of 8 August , in the third attempt , the 1st , 1 / 5th , and 1 / 8th attacked in conditions that rendered visibility poor . The 1st and 1 / 8th reached the German front @-@ line trenches and entered the village . Their situation deteriorated , however , and the 1 / 8th 's support battalion was driven back by Germans who continued to occupy the first @-@ line trenches . Isolated and contained by counter @-@ attacks , the 1 / 8th and three companies of the 1st were surrounded and mostly captured . The 1 / 8th had been annihilated , with losses amounting to 15 killed , 55 wounded , and 502 missing , while the 1st lost its commanding officer , Colonel Goff , and sustained 239 casualties . The 1st later received a draft of 20 officers and 750 men from the Manchester Regiment . 
 Wanting to alleviate the pressure on the French to the south and believing there might still be some holding out , high command ordered the 2nd and 55th divisions to resume the battle on the 9th . The attack failed and proved to be ill @-@ prepared and disorganised , with an identical starting time and objectives . For his actions during the battle , Captain Chavasse , attached to the Liverpool Scottish , gained the first of two VCs for attending to and rescuing wounded in no man 's land . The village would not be captured until the final struggle began on 3 September , by which time the 12th was the King 's only contribution , and the regiment had more than 3 @,@ 000 casualties . 
 After the Somme Offensive ended in November , the Allies began to prepare for a series of combined Allied offensives in April 1917 . These plans would not be significantly disrupted by the German Army 's strategic withdrawal to the " Hindenburg Line " in northern France . The phased withdrawal , conducted from February to April , reduced the German front by 25 miles ( 40 km ) . The regiment 's six second @-@ line battalions arrived on the Western Front with the 57th ( 2nd West Lancashire ) Division in February 1917 . 
 To support the ill @-@ fated Nivelle Offensive , Britain initiated the Battle of the Scarpe , in the Arras area on 9 April , which involved the regiment 's 11th , 13th , and Liverpool Pals battalions . The 13th moved forward with the 3rd Division at 0530 , near Tilloy @-@ les @-@ Mofflaines , capturing almost 500 men and completing its objectives . To the south , barbed wire obstructed the Pals with varied results . The 18th consolidated in front of the wire until relieved on the 10th , while the 19th and 20th were eventually withdrawn , having suffered heavy losses within about 100 yards ( 91 m ) of the wire . Casualties for the King 's during the initial phase of the Arras Offensive exceeded 700 . 
 While the battle raged in Arras , the Allies prepared for an offensive in the north , in Flanders . " Third Ypres " ( or Passchendaele ) became notorious for conditions that transformed the terrain of shell holes and trenches into a quagmire of mud . Ten of the regiment 's battalions were active in the first stage , the Battle of <unk> Ridge ( 31 July – 2 August ) . Six belonged to the 55th Division , situated in the Wieltje sector , north of the Liverpool Pals . The territorial battalions overcame their first and second objectives , but progress was difficult . Confusion prevailed during the 18th King 's and 2nd <unk> nocturnal advance through Sanctuary Wood . The Pals battalions had to consolidate in front of the 30th Division 's initial objective . The King 's losses accumulated , surpassing 1 @,@ 800 by the 3rd , with the supporting 1 / 8th 's casualties the heaviest at 18 officers and 304 other ranks . The 10th 's medical officer , Captain Chavasse , received a posthumous , second Victoria Cross for attending to , and recovering , wounded in spite of his own wounds and fatigue during the battle . He succumbed to his wounds on 4 August . 
 An account by Captain <unk> , 2 / 6th Liverpool Rifles , described the conditions endured by soldiers in the Ypres area : 
 = = = 1918 = = = 
 The King 's contributed to the Battle of Cambrai in November 1917 and assisted in defensive actions as the new year neared . Acute manpower shortages in the BEF on the Western Front left many divisions understrength and so it was decided to adopt a nine @-@ battalion system through amalgamations and disbandments . The 5th , 8th , 9th , and 10th King 's integrated with their second @-@ line , while hundreds of their men were distributed to other King 's battalions . The 20th disbanded in February , with its strength dispersed to the other Liverpool Pals . 
 As the American Expeditionary Forces emboldened the Allies , Germany prepared for a final attempt to achieve a decisive victory before the US contingent on the Western Front surged further . On 21 March , a five @-@ hour artillery and gas shell barrage across a 50 @-@ mile ( 80 km ) front signified the beginning of the Battle of St. Quentin ( Operation Michael ) and the Spring Offensive in the Somme . Although roled as pioneers , the 11th King 's occupied frontline trenches near <unk> when the attack began . Two of its companies engaged troops at <unk> Wood and <unk> and the battalion 's casualties for the day exceeded 160 . The Liverpool Pals , in reserve on the 21st , hurried to the front on the 22nd to undertake localised counter @-@ attacks , with the first and largest conducted by the 19th against the village of <unk> . The battalion advanced in darkness after 0115 , uncertain of German positions , but retook the original frontline trenches unopposed . They later came under sustained attack , holding out without support until Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Peck ordered a withdrawal at about 1600 . The Germans overwhelmed the survivors , capturing the wounded Peck and many others . 
 The situation became dire , forcing troops to withdraw towards Ham , which itself had to be evacuated . The Third and Fifth Armies went into retreat . The 1st King 's , occupying positions near <unk> Wood during the Battle of Bapaume , came under attack on the 24th but held out until their deteriorating flanks compelled a retreat that was covered by about 30 men from its headquarters . The battalion commander , Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Murray @-@ Lyon , had just 60 men at his command when they arrived at <unk> later in the day . On 28 March , the offensive was extended to Arras , which was soon repulsed by the Allies . Having lost its <unk> and suffered about 250 @,@ 000 casualties , comparable to Allied losses , Germany abandoned the operation on 5 April . The German Army did not relent and launched Operation Georgette in Flanders on 9 April . The first @-@ day of the Battle of the Lys involved the three King 's battalions of the 165th Brigade , situated at Estaires . The bombardment against Allied positions began at <unk> and the subsequent infantry attack displaced Portuguese forces by 0800 , exposing the left flank of the 165th . The King 's repulsed the frontal assaults with heavy casualties but continued to be attacked from the flanks . Counter @-@ attacks by the 1 / 7th King 's and 2 / 5th Lancashire Fusiliers took up to 500 prisoners . 
 German forces made significant gains , capturing Armentières . On 11 April , British Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , General Haig , issued his " backs to the walls " order of the day . Five days later , Private Counter , 1st King 's , volunteered as a messenger , having witnessed five preceding runners killed . He was awarded the regiment 's last Victoria Cross . The 4th King 's experienced heavy fighting near Méteren and by 19 April had at least 489 casualties . Despite relentless battles , the Allies stabilised their front and Georgette was discontinued on 29 April after the Battle of the <unk> . The Liverpool Pals fought in that climax , with the 17th having to withdraw with the loss of " A " Company , while the 18th and 19th repelled their attackers . 
 The German Army halted its offensives in July . The King 's 11th Battalion disbanded in April , followed in May by the temporary consolidation of the Liverpool Pals as the 17th ( Composite ) Battalion . Their brief unity ended in May when they reduced to form training cadres for the U.S. 137th Regiment . In August , after four months of being on the defensive , the Allies launched an offensive against Amiens , in the Somme area . Meticulous preparation gave them the element of surprise when it began on the 8th . More than 16 @,@ 000 prisoners were taken within two hours and the German frontline mostly collapsed . In the following Battle of Albert , begun on the 21st , the 13th King 's suffered 274 casualties , but captured 150 soldiers and many machine @-@ guns , while the 1st assisted in the taking of <unk> . 
 The war 's end in Europe came with the signing of the Armistice of 11 November 1918 . The 9th Battalion 's history illustrated the initial reaction of soldiers : 
 On 11 December 1918 , the remnants of the 1st King 's marched across the German frontier " at ease " , bayonets fixed and their colours uncased . The battalion would be based at Düren and Berg <unk> for about five months as part of the British Army of the Rhine , joined by other battalions such as the 13th . Some , including the 25th ( Reserve ) , served in Egypt and Belgium before the majority disbanded by late 1919 . 
 = = Inter @-@ war ( 1918 – 1939 ) = = 
 Hostilities did not end for the 17th King 's on 11 November ; the battalion had sailed for Murmansk , Russia , in October as part of an Allied intervention force assembled to support the " White " forces in their civil war against the Bolsheviks . The battalion was moved to Archangel , where it was based intact for a short period . The battalion 's companies served separately for the duration of their stay in Russia , until the 17th left in September 1919 . 
 The Territorial Force was disbanded and later reformed as the Territorial Army and the regiment 's battalions were also reformed . However , inter @-@ war reductions and reorganisations reduced the regiment 's territorial battalions from six to just one by 1937 . The 8th disbanded in the early 1920s , the 9th was absorbed by the Royal Engineers , and a restructuring of the Territorial Army 's infantry in the mid @-@ 1930s converted the 6th , 7th , and 10th to new roles . The 6th were transferred to the Royal Engineers and became 38th ( King 's ) Searchlight Regiment , Royal Engineers . The 7th joined the Royal Tank Regiment and became the 40th ( The King 's ) Royal Tank Regiment , and the 10th became a battalion of the Queen 's Own Cameron Highlanders .

 As Britain 's control of Ireland eroded in 1920 during the Irish War of Independence , the 1st Battalion deployed to Bantry , County Cork . The county was a ferment of Republican activity where British forces frequently subjected the movement 's supporters to oppressive measures in an attempt to curtail escalating violence . Compared to other regiments operating in the county , such as the Essex Regiment , the King 's acquired a favourable reputation among its adversaries for their professionalism and humane treatment of prisoners — which reputedly saved the lives of some Kingsmen . Their conduct was described by Tom Barry , a prominent IRA leader , as " exemplary in all the circumstances " . After the establishment of the Irish Free State in the south , the battalion moved to Northern Ireland to be stationed in Derry and Omagh . 
 After a brief deployment to Turkey as part of the army of occupation , the battalion returned to England in 1924 and resumed overseas service in 1926 with postings to Malta , Sudan , and Egypt . While much of the battalion 's time in Egypt was peaceful and comfortable , they occasionally dealt with rioting , and on one occasion a company had to be deployed to Jerusalem . In October 1931 , Greek Cypriots in Cyprus <unk> demanding union with Greece . The battalion reinforced the British garrison with two companies ; C Company arrived via eight Vickers Victoria air transports , followed by the sea @-@ transported " D " . India was the 1st King 's next posting , initially in <unk> . The battalion relocated to Landi Kotal , Khyber Pass , in 1937 . Service in the volatile North @-@ West Frontier Province continued into the Second World War .

 The 2nd Battalion continued to serve in India following the Armistice and mobilised during the Third Afghan War in 1919 . Leading a " Special Column " , the battalion reached the Toba Plateau , some 8 @,@ 000 feet ( 2 @,@ 400 m ) high , but the war was concluded before the battalion could engage Afghan forces . 
 Those personnel who remained after the majority demobilised in 1920 joined the Sudan garrison , where the battalion reformed . Postings to Hong Kong and Canton followed in 1922 , then to India in 1924 , and finally Iraq the next year . Stationed near Baghdad , its residence lasted for two years , uneventful but with the distinction of being the last British battalion to serve there until the Second World War . 
 Immediately after returning to England , the 2nd King 's became the first battalion of the regiment to undertake public duties at Buckingham Palace . The battalion was based in various parts of the country for nearly a decade until 1938 , when it became part of the Gibraltar garrison . 
 = = Second World War = = 
 For the regiment , expansion was on a more modest scale than that of the Great War . Ten battalions ( see List of battalions of the King 's Regiment ( Liverpool ) ) were formed between 1939 and 1940 , including the reconstituted 8th ( Liverpool Irish ) Battalion . Two of the battalions converted to armour and anti @-@ air roles in 1941 : the 11th became the 152nd Regiment in the Royal Armoured Corps , but continued to wear their King 's Regiment cap badge on the black beret of the RAC , as did all infantry units converted in this way , while the 12th transferred to the Royal Artillery as 101st Light Anti @-@ Aircraft Regiment . 
 By late 1941 , the regiment had three battalions ( 1st , 2nd , and 13th ) stationed abroad with the remainder poised to defend the United Kingdom against a possible German invasion . The 1st and 13th battalions serve in Burma as Chindits , the 2nd in Italy and Greece during the Greek Civil War , and the 5th and 8th in Western Front of World War II . The 9th Battalion , formed as a duplicate of the 5th in 1939 , served with the 164th Brigade , 55th Division , transferring to 165th Brigade in April 1943 . Of the battalions that had switched to other roles , only the 40th RTR ( 7th King 's ) experienced active service . With the 23rd Armoured Brigade , the 40th RTR fought in the North African Campaign , where they acquired the nickname " Monty 's Foxhounds " , Italy , and Greece . 
 = = = Italy and Greece = = = 
 Having spent five years in Gibraltar with the 1st Gibraltar Brigade , the 2nd Battalion King 's departed in December 1943 with the 28th Infantry Brigade ( previously 1st Gibraltar Brigade ) to reinforce the 4th Infantry Division in Egypt . The battalion landed in Italy with the 4th when the division joined the campaign in March 1944 . On 11 May , the division conducted an opposed crossing of the Gari River during the final Fourth Battle of Monte Cassino . The 2nd King 's constituted , along with the 2nd Somersets , the main element of 28th Infantry Brigade 's initial assault . Behind schedule by 35 minutes and thus lacking artillery support , the battalion attempted to traverse the Gari under sustained mortar and artillery fire . Many boats capsized because of the strong current with resultant losses . The 4th Division collectively struggled to consolidate its bridgehead and minefields and a determined German defence inflicted casualties on the 2nd King 's and mortally wounded their commanding officer , Lieutenant Colonel <unk> @-@ Williams . Depleted and disorganised , the remnants withdrew from an untenable bridgehead on the 14th . The 2nd King 's by then had 72 men killed or missing and many wounded . After five months and four battles , Monte Cassino was captured on 18 May by the Polish II Corps and the Gustav Line broken . 
 The Allies captured Rome in June and the 2nd King 's fought in the subsequent advance to the Trasimene Line . The King 's captured <unk> in a fierce battle that had involved the 2 / 4th Hampshires ( part of 28th Brigade ) , and later secured and defended <unk> against counter @-@ attack , earning the regiment a unique battle honour in the British Army . In about nine months of service , in difficult , mountainous terrain , with heavy casualties , the battalion was awarded four DSOs , nine MCs , three DCMs , four MMs , and six mentioned in despatches . Among the recipients were Sergeant <unk> , who single @-@ handedly secured a fortified farmhouse , and Major J. A. de V. Reynolds , for his leadership and conduct around Casa <unk> . 
 In December , the 4th Infantry Division was deployed to Greece to reinforce British forces embroiled in the country 's civil war . Conflict in Greece between government forces and Communist partisans followed the vacuum created by the German withdrawal . The partisans ( <unk> ) sought to establish themselves as the new political authority and confronted the British @-@ supported government @-@ in @-@ exile when ordered to disband and disarm . Within 24 hours of being flown to Piraeus on 12 December , the 2nd King 's had to engage partisans in a brief action , seizing occupied barracks at a cost of 14 casualties . During a seven @-@ week internal security employment , there were many instances of house @-@ to @-@ house and street fighting in Athens . By mid @-@ January 1945 , the city had been cleared of insurgents and a ceasefire agreed upon , followed by the <unk> Agreement in February . The King 's remained for a year to support a tense peace until they left for Cyprus .

 The 13th Battalion , King 's Regiment , was raised in October 1940 for coastal defence in England and assigned to the 208th Independent Infantry Brigade ( Home ) . The battalion sailed for India in December 1941 , coinciding with Japan 's entrance into the war . Intended for internal security and garrison duties , the 13th 's strength contained many men categorised as old or of a medically downgraded condition with the result that few men were well trained . After Japan occupied Burma in 1942 , the Allies formed a unit intended to penetrate deep behind Japanese lines from India . The 13th King 's provided the majority of the British contingent for the " Chindits " , which was formally designated as the 77th Indian Infantry Brigade and commanded by Brigadier Orde Wingate . 
 Organised into two groups , the Chindits ' first operation ( codenamed <unk> ) began on 8 February 1943 . No. 2 Group , commanded by Lieutenant Colonel S.A. Cooke , was formed from the 13th King 's and divided into five independent columns , two of which ( Nos 7 and 8 ) were commanded by majors from the battalion . No Japanese opposition was encountered initially , allowing the Chindits to cross the Chindwin River and advance into Burma unimpeded . 
 The 1st Battalion also took part in a similar operation in 1944 and formed 81 and 82 Columns . As in the first expedition in 1943 the Chindits again suffered heavy casualties and fought behind the Japanese lines at Kohima and Imphal . After Orde Wingate was killed in a crash in March 1944 , it was decided to break up the remaining <unk> formations and some of them were to be converted into airborne infantry battalions . The 1st King 's was converted to become the 15th ( King 's ) Parachute Battalion of the Parachute Regiment and joined the 77th Indian Parachute Brigade attached to the 44th Indian Airborne Division where it remained for the rest of the war .

 In 1943 , the 5th and 8th King 's ( Liverpool Irish ) received specialist training at Ayrshire in preparation for a planned invasion of France . They had been selected to form the nucleus of the 5th and 7th Beach Groups , which would have the objectives of maintaining beach organisation , securing positions , and providing defence against counter @-@ attack . 
 As invasion neared in mid @-@ 1944 , the two battalions moved from their camps to ports in southern England and embarked aboard troopships and landing ship tanks . Much of the Liverpool Irish embarked aboard the Ulster Monarch , a passenger ship that had served on the Belfast @-@ Liverpool line before the war . Having been delayed , the invasion fleet proceeded to Normandy on 5 June . Both King 's battalions landed on D @-@ Day , the 5th at Sword with the 3rd British Infantry Division and the Liverpool Irish at Juno with the 3rd Canadian Infantry Division . 
 Two companies of the Liverpool Irish landed in the assault wave with the Royal Winnipeg Rifles . Under intense machine gun and mortar fire , the landing of Major Max Morrison 's " A " Company proceeded well , allowing some to establish a command @-@ post upon reaching the sand dunes . In contrast , in " B " Company 's sector , the late arrival of the reconnaissance party and DD tanks exposed the landing infantry to heavy machine gun fire . The company 's officer commanding , Major O 'Brien , and the second @-@ in @-@ command were among those wounded . At Sword , as the 3rd Division moved inland , the 5th King 's attempted to neutralise hostile positions and snipers . Casualties included Lieutenant @-@ Colonel D. H. V. Board , killed by a sniper , and the OC of 9 Platoon , Lieutenant Scarfe , mortally wounded in an attack on a German position that captured 16 soldiers . 
 Under fire , the beach groups collected the wounded and dead , located and marked minefields , attempted to maintain organisation , and directed vehicles and troops inland . The two battalions operated with the beach groups for a further six weeks . While the depleted Liverpool Irish disbanded in August , much of its strength having been transferred to other units as reinforcements , the 5th King 's survived as a reduced cadre . Disbandment had only been avoided through the determination of Lieutenant Colonel G.D. Wreford @-@ Brown , who argued that the 5th Battalion was nearly the most senior unit active in the Territorial Army . 
 Before the Allies advanced into Nazi Germany in February 1945 , the Supreme Headquarters Allied Expeditionary Force ( SHAEF ) began to form dedicated units to secure important objectives — equipment , installations , intelligence , and personnel . The 5th King 's provided the nucleus for No. 2 T ( Target ) Force . Elements of the 5th reached the naval port of Kiel in May 1945 , securing the cruiser Admiral Hipper and taking 7 @,@ 000 sailors prisoner . The battalion continued to conduct intelligence operations until disbandment in July 1946 during the <unk> process . Reconstitution into the Territorial Army followed in 1947 under the command of Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Edward Stanley .

 The 1st King 's , still roled as 15th ( King 's ) Parachute Battalion , remained in India with responsibility for the area around Meerut , north @-@ east of New Delhi . After reconverting to standard infantry , the battalion departed for Liverpool in late 1947 . In April 1948 , the 2nd King 's deployed to the British Mandate of Palestine for two weeks . The battalion carried out internal security duties in the prelude to Israel 's establishment for two weeks before its return to Cyprus . When the army reduced its strength , the 2nd King 's chose to be absorbed by the 1st rather than have its lineage terminated . On 6 September 1948 , the two battalions amalgamated in a ceremonial parade attended by honorary Colonel of the Regiment , Major @-@ General Dudley Ward . The battalion was posted to West Germany shortly afterwards and moved to West Berlin in February 1951 . 
 = = = Korean War = = = 
 The battalion was ordered to Korea in June 1952 . By then , the Korean War had entered a period of stalemate , with trench warfare prevailing . At Liverpool , the King 's embarked aboard the troopship Devonshire for Hong Kong , where it underwent training before landing at Pusan , Korea , in September . Replacing the 1st Royal Norfolk Regiment in the 29th Infantry Brigade , 1st Commonwealth Division , the 1st King 's took up defensive positions on moving to the frontline , about 45 miles ( 72 km ) from Seoul . 
 While much of the battalion 's time at the front proved uneventful , its night patrols often clashed with Chinese troops . In 1953 , the battalion withdrew to reserve for three months . A tactically important feature known as " The Hook " , a crescent shaped ridge , was the scene of intense fighting between Commonwealth forces and the Chinese in May . On the night of 20 May , Chinese forces commenced a sustained bombardment of the Hook , defended by the Duke of Wellington 's Regiment . Two days later , a company from the King 's conducted a nighttime diversionary raid on Chinese positions known as " Pheasant " . During the raid , Second @-@ Lieutenant <unk> ' 5 Platoon , intended to execute the actual attack , inadvertently stumbled upon an uncharted minefield , suffering 10 wounded from a strength of 16 . The attack had to be abandoned , forcing the company to withdraw with its wounded back to British lines under the protection of artillery . 
 The King 's moved to the right sector of the Hook on 27 May , excepting " D " Company 's 10 Platoon and " B " Company ( as reserve ) , which became attached to the Dukes . At 1953 hours , on 28 May , the battle began when a heavy artillery barrage targeted the Dukes ' positions . Within minutes , the first of four successive Chinese waves attacked . Two King 's platoons had to be moved forward to reinforce the Point 121 position , which soon after came under attack by two infantry companies . After the attack was repulsed with the assistance of Commonwealth artillery , the Chinese directed their attention to the King 's on Point 146 . As their troops assembled at Pheasant at around 2305 , 1st King 's Lieutenant @-@ Colonel A.J. Snodgrass called in artillery , Centurion tank , and machine @-@ gun fire that effectively destroyed the battalion @-@ sized formation . Fighting continued until the British cleared the remaining troops from the Hook at approximately 0330 . British casualties numbered 149 , including 28 killed , while Chinese losses were estimated to be 250 killed and 800 wounded . 
 The 1st King 's left Korea for Hong Kong in October , by which time the battalion had suffered 28 dead and 200 wounded . Of some 1 @,@ 500 men that served with the King 's in Korea , 350 were regular soldiers , the rest being conscripts on national service . The King 's moved to Britain in 1955 , were posted to West Germany the following year , and made its final return home in May 1958 . 
 = = = Amalgamation = = = 
 The 1957 Defence White Paper ( known as the " Sandys Review " after Secretary of State for War Duncan Sandys ) announced the government 's intention to reduce the army 's overseas responsibilities and abolish national service . Regiments and other units were rationalised through amalgamation or disbandment . The decision to merge the King 's and Manchesters dismayed many serving and retired personnel . The regiments did , however , share an historical connection through the 63rd ( West Suffolk ) Regiment of Foot , constituted as the 8th Foot 's second battalion in 1756 and redesignated the 1st Battalion , Manchester Regiment in 1881 . 
 In June , at Brentwood , the colours of the two regiments were paraded for the last time in the presence of Queen Elizabeth , The Queen Mother . The King 's Regiment ( Manchester and Liverpool ) formally came into being on 1 September 1958 . On 1 July 2006 , the successor regiment amalgamated , joining with two others to form the Duke of Lancaster 's Regiment . 
 The surviving territorial battalion of the King 's ( Liverpool ) , the 5th , retained its identity until reduced to " B " Company , Lancastrian Volunteers in 1967 . The lineage of 5th King 's later became perpetuated by " A " Company on its formation in 1992 . The company became an integral component of the 4th Battalion , Duke of Lancaster 's Regiment in 2006 and contained the Liverpool Scottish Platoon .

 Dolbadarn Castle is a fortification built by the Welsh prince Llywelyn the Great during the early 13th century , at the base of the Llanberis Pass , in North Wales . The castle was important both militarily and as a symbol of Llywelyn 's power and authority . The castle features a large stone keep , which historian Richard Avent considers " the finest surviving example of a Welsh round tower " . In 1284 Dolbadarn was taken by Edward I , who removed some of its timbers to build his new castle at Caernarfon . The castle was used as a manor house for some years , before falling into ruin . In the 18th and 19th century it was a popular destination for painters interested in Sublime and Picturesque landscapes . It is now owned by Cadw and managed as a tourist attraction , and is protected as a grade I listed building .

 Dolbadarn Castle was built in either the 1220s or the 1230s by Llywelyn the Great , at the base of the Llanberis Pass , overlooking the lake of Llyn Padarn in North Wales . Traditionally the Welsh princes had not constructed castles , instead using undefended palaces called <unk> , or courts . From the late 11th century onwards , the Normans had advanced into Wales , taking lands in the north and establishing a band of occupied territory in the south called the Welsh Marches . During the 12th century some timber and earthwork castles began to be built , but in small numbers . 
 Llywelyn the Great initially controlled the princedom of Gwynedd , but grew more powerful over the course of his reign , extending his influence over much of Wales during the early years of the 13th century . Llywelyn was faced by several challenges , including dealing with the threat from the kings of England , and maintaining his authority over the native Welsh . As part of this strategy , Llywelyn built Castell y Bere , an innovative stone Welsh castle , in the 1220s . Shortly afterwards he began the first phases of Dolbadarn Castle , constructing the initial stone fortifications on the site , including two square stone towers . 
 The location of the castle was important both because it controlled an important mountain pass , and possibly because Llywelyn claimed authority as the lord of the mountains and coasts of Wales : several of his castles appear to have been located with such political symbolism in mind . It is also possible that Llywelyn may have built his castle on top of the remains of a previous fortification constructed by Maelgwn Gwynedd , a king of Gwynedd in the 6th century , although no such remains have been found . 
 As part of his strategy for dealing with the Marcher Lords , Llywelyn married his eldest son , Dafydd , to Isabella , the daughter of William de Braose , a powerful lord in Brecon , Builth and Abergavenny . The Marcher Lords had adopted a style of stone castle that included circular keeps and an integrated system of curtain walls . Following Dafydd 's marriage , Llywelyn appears to have started a second phase of building at Dolbadarn , probably in the 1240s , adding these elements to the existing castle . The prince was probably aiming not only to incorporate the latest military technology , but also to create a castle of equal prestige to those of his new allies in the south . Traditionally the surrounding district of Is <unk> had been run from the town of <unk> ; after the 1240s , this role was transferred to Dolbadarn . 
 = = = 1240 – 1300 = = = 
 Following Llywelyn 's death in 1240 , Gwynedd 's power declined and many of its eastern lands were taken by Henry III of England in 1247 . Llywelyn 's grandson , Llywelyn ap Gruffudd , took power in 1255 and imprisoned his brother Owain ap Gruffudd before extending his power across Wales . Owain was eventually released in 1277 and there has been much historical debate over which castle he was held in . Hywel Foel ap <unk> wrote a famous poem describing Owain 's long imprisonment in a round tower ; historians believe that this refers to the keep at <unk> . 
 The conflict between the Welsh princes and the English kings continued in the reign of Edward I. In 1282 Llywelyn fought a final campaign against Edward , ending in the prince 's death near Builth that December . His brother , Dafydd ap Gruffydd , assumed power but during 1283 was forced south into Snowdonia and by May his government was based from Dolbadarn Castle . Edward deployed 7 @,@ 000 troops to detain Dafydd who was finally captured and executed in October ; Dolbadarn was occupied by Norman forces . 
 Edward was determined to prevent any further rebellion in North Wales and set about building a sequence of new castles and walled towns , replacing the old Welsh administrative system with a new principality governed from Caernarfon . Dolbadarn was no longer relevant and within two years timber from the castle was being used by the Normans for the construction of Caernarfon Castle . This was both a practical and a symbolic action , demonstrating Norman power over one of the most important possessions of the Welsh princes . 
 = = = 14th – 21st centuries = = = 
 The remaining parts of the castle continued to be used as a manor house into the 14th century . By the 18th century , however , Dolbadarn Castle was ruined and uninhabited . From the 1760s onwards , however , it became a popular topic for painters interested in the then fashionable landscape styles of the Sublime and the Picturesque . Typically the castle was painted in the middle ground , allowing the viewer 's eye to contrast its ruined outline with the lakes and mountains of Snowdonia ; frequently the landscape was misrepresented by the artist , to create a more striking or dramatic effect . J. M. W. Turner 's 1800 work Dolbadarn Castle depicted the back @-@ lit castle looming over the landscape and became particularly famous , but the paintings of the castle by Richard Wilson and Paul Sandby also represent important artistic works of the period . 
 In 1941 the castle was given to the State by Sir Michael Duff . It is now maintained by Cadw and is protected as a Grade I listed building and as a scheduled monument . In the light of Welsh devolution and other political changes , the history of Dolbadarn Castle and similar Welsh castles has become increasing prominent . In response , Cadw have noted that they intend to give an increased priority to communicating the history of these castles and the Welsh princes . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 Dolbadarn Castle comprises a courtyard , surrounded by a number of towers and a round keep . The castle is built from purple and green slate stone , mainly constructed in a dry stone fashion without mortar , with the exception of the keep . The courtyard follows the natural shape of the hill and is protected by a curtain wall ; originally perhaps 15 feet ( 5 m ) high , it is now only at most 3 feet ( 1 m ) high . Of the castle buildings , only the keep remains to any significant height . 
 The keep today is 46 feet ( 14 m ) high and is modelled on early 13th @-@ century English round towers built in the south of the Welsh Marches . As with other Welsh @-@ constructed towers , the entrance is on the first storey , not at ground level ; it may originally have been protected by a porch . The keep had a portcullis which would have been drawn up past the window on the second storey of the tower . While the castle 's flooring has long since disappeared , its interior staircase to the upper storey may still be climbed . This second storey would have formed the main chamber in the keep and had a large fireplace and a latrine . Originally the keep would have had a parapet and battlements , since destroyed . Historian Richard Avent considers it " the finest surviving example of a Welsh round tower " . 
 The rectangular west tower was a relatively short defensive structure , designed to protect the more vulnerable western slope of the ridge . A similar tower in the south overlooks the entrance to the castle . At the north end of the castle is the hall , stretching across the courtyard ; in the east corner is an additional building , probably built by the English at the end of the 13th century . Although the hall is relatively large , 50 by 27 feet ( 15 by 8 m ) , these buildings follow a simpler design to those current in England at the time , where a combination of a hall , chamber and a service block in castles was becoming more common . 
 = USS Nicholson ( DD @-@ 52 ) = 
 USS Nicholson ( Destroyer No. 52 / DD @-@ 52 ) was an O 'Brien @-@ class destroyer built for the United States Navy before the American entry into World War I. The ship was the second U.S. Navy vessel named in honor of five members of the Nicholson family who gave distinguished service in the American Revolutionary War , the War of 1812 , and the American Civil War : brothers James , Samuel , and John Nicholson ; William Nicholson , son of John ; and James W. Nicholson , grandson of Samuel . 
 Nicholson was laid down by William Cramp and Sons of Philadelphia in September 1913 and launched in August 1914 . The ship was a little more than 305 ft ( 93 m ) in length , just over 31 feet ( 9 @.@ 4 m ) abeam , and had a standard displacement of 1 @,@ 050 long tons ( 1 @,@ 070 t ) . She was armed with four 4 in ( 100 mm ) guns and had eight 21 in ( 530 mm ) torpedo tubes . Nicholson was powered by a pair of steam turbines that propelled her at up to 29 kn ( 33 mph ; 54 km / h ) . 
 After her April 1915 commissioning , Nicholson sailed off the east coast and in the Caribbean . After the United States entered World War I in April 1917 , Nicholson was sent overseas to patrol the Irish Sea out of Queenstown , Ireland . In October 1917 , Nicholson steamed to the rescue of J. L. Luckenbach , driving off German submarine U @-@ 62 , which had shelled the American cargo ship for over three hours . In November , Nicholson and another US destroyer , Fanning , were responsible for sinking German submarine U @-@ 58 , the first submarine taken by US forces during the war . In September 1918 , Nicholson helped drive off U @-@ 82 after that U @-@ boat had torpedoed the American troopship Mount Vernon off the coast of France . 
 Upon returning to the United States after the war , Nicholson was placed in reduced commission in November 1919 . She was decommissioned at Philadelphia in May 1922 . She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register in January 1936 and sold for scrapping in June . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 Nicholson was authorized in March 1913 as the second of six ships of the O 'Brien class , which was an improved version of the Cassin @-@ class destroyers authorized in 1911 . Construction of the vessel was awarded to William Cramp and Sons of Philadelphia which laid down her keel on 8 September 1913 , the same date as of sister ship O 'Brien . On 19 August 1914 , Nicholson was launched by sponsor Mrs. Charles T. Taylor . The ship was the second US Navy ship named after five members of the Nicholson family who gave distinguished service in the American Revolutionary War , the War of 1812 , and the American Civil War . They were brothers James Nicholson , the senior Continental Navy Captain ; Samuel Nicholson , the first captain of USS Constitution ; and John Nicholson ; Also honored were William Nicholson , son of John ; and James W. Nicholson , grandson of Samuel . 
 As built , the destroyer was 305 ft 3 in ( 93 @.@ 04 m ) in length , 31 ft 1 in ( 9 @.@ 47 m ) abeam , and drew 10 ft 4 @.@ 5 in ( 3 @.@ 162 m ) . The ship had a standard displacement of 1 @,@ 050 long tons ( 1 @,@ 070 t ) and displaced 1 @,@ 171 long tons ( 1 @,@ 190 t ) when fully loaded . 
 Nicholson had two Zoelly steam turbines that drove her two screw propellers , and an additional pair triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each connected to one of the propeller shafts , for cruising purposes . Four oil @-@ burning White @-@ Forster boilers powered the engines , which could generate 17 @,@ 000 shp ( 13 @,@ 000 kW ) , moving the ship at up to 29 kn ( 33 mph ; 54 km / h ) . Nicholson reached an average speed of 29 @.@ 084 kn ( 33 @.@ 469 mph ; 53 @.@ 864 km / h ) over a 4 @-@ hour run during sea trials on 23 March 1915 . 
 Nicholson 's main battery consisted of four 4 in ( 102 mm ) / 50 caliber Mark 9 guns , with each gun weighing in excess of 6 @,@ 100 lb ( 2 @,@ 800 kg ) . The guns fired 33 lb ( 15 kg ) armor @-@ piercing projectiles at 2 @,@ 900 ft / s ( 880 m / s ) . At an elevation of 20 ° , the guns had a range of 15 @,@ 920 yd ( 14 @,@ 560 m ) . 
 Nicholson was also equipped with eight 21 in ( 530 mm ) torpedo tubes . The General Board of the United States Navy had called for two anti @-@ aircraft guns for the O 'Brien @-@ class ships , as well as provisions for laying up to 36 floating mines . From sources , it is unclear if these recommendations were followed for Nicholson or any of the other ships of the class . 
 = = World War I = = 
 Nicholson was commissioned into the United States Navy on 30 April 1915 under the command of Lieutenant Commander A. E. Watson in command . After a shakedown cruise in the North Atlantic , Nicholson operated in the Caribbean and along the east coast until early 1917 . 
 After the United States declared war on Germany on 6 April 1917 entering World War I , Nicholson was put to sea from New York on 15 May with Cummings , Cushing , O 'Brien , and Sampson . The destroyers arrived at Queenstown , Ireland , 24 May for duty in the war zone . 
 In mid @-@ October , Nicholson was part of the destroyer escort , for the eastbound convoy HS 14 . At <unk> , an SOS was received from SS J. L. Luckenbach , traveling independently some 90 nmi ( 100 mi ; 170 km ) ahead of the convoy . Commander Alfred W. Johnson on USS Conyngham ( DD @-@ 58 ) , the commander of the escorting destroyer unit , dispatched Nicholson to steam ahead to assist J. L. Luckenbach , which was being shelled by a German submarine . J. L. Luckenbach was equipped with guns of her own , but they were outranged by the pair of 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) deck guns on her attacker , U @-@ 62 . By the time Nicholson arrived on the scene at about 1230 , U @-@ 62 had been shelling J. L. Luckenbach for over three hours . Despite many rounds fired , only about a dozen had hit the American steamer ; some of the hits , however , had ignited J. L. Luckenbach 's cargo of cotton . Nicholson trained her 4 in ( 100 mm ) guns on the U @-@ boat and , by the time her gunners had fired a second round , U @-@ 62 submerged and disappeared . The destroyer transferred a damage control party aboard J. L. Luckenbach which helped extinguish the fire and repair some of the damages to the ship . A few hours later , J. L. Luckenbach and Nicholson joined and rejoined the convoy , respectively . 
 = = = Sinking of U @-@ 58 = = = 
 The following month , Nicholson had a more successful encounter with a U @-@ boat . Operating as the destroyer division 's flagship , Nicholson - under the command of Lieutenant Commander Frank D. Berrien - and her group had joined the eastbound convoy OQ 20 on the afternoon of 17 November . At about 1615 , Fanning was steaming to her position at the rear of the eight @-@ ship convoy when her lookouts spotted a periscope just ahead . The periscope belonged to U @-@ 58 under the command of Kapitänleutnant Gustav <unk> , who was lining up a torpedo shot on the British steamer SS Welshman . 
 While Fanning circled around and dropped a depth charge on the spot where the periscope had been seen , Nicholson , which had raced through the convoy , dropped another in nearly the same location ; both were to good effect . The two depth charges knocked out the electric motor that powered U @-@ 58 's diving planes , making the vessel unmanageable . U @-@ 58 broached the surface momentarily and Fanning dropped another trio of depth charges over the submarine . These three knocked out all electrical power and the manual diving plane controls , which caused the submarine to descend through a depth of 164 ft ( 50 m ) . <unk> ordered the ballast tanks blown and the submarine slowly rose to the surface , stabilizing on the surface with her bow pointing down . The submarines four officers and 35 men evacuated U @-@ 58 and surrendered to Fanning at 16 : 28 , but not before opening the sea valves to allow the U @-@ boat to sink . One of U @-@ 58 's crewmen drowned before reaching Fanning , while another died of a heart attack after he was brought aboard the destroyer . 
 An official account of the sinking was released to the press on 29 December , and Fanning and Nicholson shared credit for what The Washington Post in a contemporary news account called the " first U @-@ Boat prize of the U.S. " during the war ; later works still credit the pair of destroyers with the US Navy 's first U @-@ Boat kill . 
 In February 1918 , Nicholson transferred to Brest where she escorted convoys along the French coast . In early September 1918 , Nicholson was one of six destroyers escorting a westbound pair of US Navy transports , Agamemnon and Mount Vernon . On the morning of 5 September , about 250 nmi ( 290 mi ; 460 km ) west of Brest , German submarine U @-@ 82 torpedoed Mount Vernon , knocking out half of the troopship 's boilers . Nicholson , Conner , Winslow , and Wainwright , all depth charged the U @-@ boat without success , but , combined with defensive efforts from Mount Vernon herself , helped prevent the submarine from launching a coup de grâce against the former German liner . Mount Vernon safely made it back to Brest with the loss of 37 crewmen out of the 1 @,@ 450 passengers and crew on board .

 Following the signing of the Armistice on 11 November , which ended all fighting , Nicholson remained in French waters . After arriving at New York on 10 January 1919 , Nicholson resumed operations along the east coast until placed in reserve at Philadelphia on 27 November . 
 In July 1920 , she was assigned the hull code of DD @-@ 52 under the US Navy 's alphanumeric classification system . In May 1921 , Nicholson was reactivated with a reduced complement . She remained active for about a year , until she was decommissioned at Philadelphia on 26 May 1922 . The ship was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 7 January 1936 , and on 30 June was sold for scrapping . 
 = Poison ( Nicole Scherzinger song ) = 
 " Poison " is a song recorded by American singer @-@ songwriter Nicole Scherzinger for her debut solo studio album , Killer Love ( 2011 ) . Released on October 25 , 2010 , it is the first single from the album . It was produced by RedOne , BeatGeek and Jimmy Joker , and is distinctively different from Scherzinger 's previous attempts at releasing solo material . " Poison " is backed with powerful synthesizers and a pulsing dance @-@ pop beat . The single was released as a two @-@ track digital download and as a seven @-@ track remixes extended play ( EP ) . 
 " Poison " has received mostly positive reviews from most music critics who praised her new sound and the energy on the record but some criticized the song for being too generic . Scherzinger performed " Poison " live for the first time on seventh series of The X Factor on November 28 , 2010 , to coincide with the song 's UK release . Both the show 's judges and studio audiences gave her a standing ovation , with the media later praising her energy , choreography and live vocals . 
 An accompanying music video , directed by Joseph Kahn , sees Scherzinger take on the role of a female superhero and switches between a good @-@ girl and bad @-@ girl persona . It was noted for its similarities to another Kahn @-@ directed video , " Toxic " by Britney Spears . " Poison " peaked at number three on the UK Singles Chart becoming Scherzinger 's second most successful single as a solo artist , in addition to peaking at number seven in Ireland , where it also became one of her highest charting releases . The single reached number one in Scotland , which was Scherzinger 's first solo number one worldwide .

 In 2007 , Scherzinger was planning to launch her debut album under the title Her Name is Nicole , however the release of four singles , including " Whatever U Like " ( featuring T.I. ) and " Baby Love " ( featuring will.i.am ) all failed to significantly impact on US charts . " Baby Love " was moderately successful reaching top @-@ twenty in Europe . After a number of <unk> the entire project was scrapped at the request of Scherzinger . In May 2010 , Rap @-@ Up reported that Scherzinger was relaunching her solo career with an " empowering " ballad called " Nobody Can Change Me " . The song was recorded in a nighttime studio session while she was competing on season 10 of the U.S. reality competition , Dancing with the Stars , and was mastered on May 23 , 2010 , ready for its premiere on Ryan Seacrest 's KIIS FM radio show the following day . Idolator was unimpressed with the " treacly pop tune " saying that the lack of sexiness , " uninspiring message " and " squeaky vocals " did Scherzinger no favors . However , Amos Barshad of New York magazine actually liked the song , stating that " there ’ s none of the Pussycat Doll ’ s forced sexiness here ; instead , it sounds like something that could have just missed the final cut on a Kelly Clarkson album ( that is sort of supposed to be a compliment , yeah ) . " 
 Then in August 2010 , Moroccan producer RedOne was interviewed by the BBC . In the interview he revealed he had been working on Scherzinger 's album . " I just finished her album . Her last one never came out because it was collecting hamburgers , like fast food . One from McDonalds , one from Burger King , and so on . It tasted good , but it wasn 't consistent . Her new record – people are really going to go crazy about it because it 's the real her . " Scherzinger 's boyfriend Lewis Hamilton selected " Poison " as the album 's first single . It debuted on her official YouTube account on October 14 , 2010 .

With a guitar @-@ driven melody , " Poison " uses a pulsating and toxic beat throughout , which is similar to that used in the Britney Spears song , " Toxic " . The lyrics were also compared to " Toxic " and said to have similar themes , according to BBC Music blogger , Fraser McAlpine . A reviewer from Rap @-@ Up spoke of the song 's overall theme . " The lead Pussycat Doll has thoughts of using a deadly elixir on the dance floor , singing through a fuzzy filter over bombastic synthesizers . " They described the song as a " toxic pop gem " . According to the sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony / ATV Music Publishing , the song has a time signature set in common time , with a tempo of 124 beats per minute . The melody is mainly composed with piano and guitar instruments .

 Bridget Daley of Hollyscoop was impressed with the song saying , " It ’ s super beat , and now we understand what RedOne meant when he told Hollyscoop how much we were going to love Nicole ’ s ' new ' sound ! " However , Becky Bain of Idolator thought the " pulsating dance song " was underwhelming . " We have to admit , we ’ re not bowled over by this one , which pretty much follows a standard , predictable dance @-@ pop formula from the double shout @-@ out at the start to the ' <unk> 'ing fade @-@ out finish " . However Bain also pointed out that current trends on the US Billboard Hot 100 were unpredictable , " then again , since when has the Hot 100 <unk> away from generic pop tunes we ’ ve heard over and over again ? This one could go either way , folks . " 
 Fraser McAlpine of BBC Music stated that he thought the song was not as good as " Toxic " by Britney Spears , but was incredibly similar . After dubbing it a weaker version of " Toxic " , he said , " And that just leaves us here with a song [ ' Poison ' ] which is all stomp and huff , a dramatic bang of a thing , which seeks to drag all the bad girls to the dancefloor so they can holler their evil intentions to into the faces of nervous men . It 's a song which makes the most of Nicole 's unwholesome sexiness – as opposed to wholesome , you understand , I 'm not saying there 's anything gross about her – and has drama and fury on its side . " Nick Levine of Digital Spy agreed saying that " Scherzinger has managed to bag herself a banger of an ( ahem ) debut single " . He described the song 's busy production as " having a whiff of the <unk> " <unk> " that is a " racket in the best possible way " . Levine also praised Scherzinger for her conviction on the song , awarding it five out of five stars . He gave " Poison " a better reception than he awarded Scherzinger 's previous attempt , " Baby Love " ( 2007 ) , which he only awarded three out of five stars , stating that it was the wrong single to launch the career of a world @-@ class superstar .

 Following Scherzinger 's performance on series seven of The X Factor , The Official Charts Company tipped " Poison " as a contender for number one on the UK Singles Chart .

Additionally " Poison " made its UK chart debut at number three with first @-@ week sales of 67 @,@ 425 , thus becoming her first top ten single in the UK , as a solo artist .

" The video 's superhero theme has been compared to Kahn 's " Toxic " music video for Britney Spears . 
 The video begins on a city sidewalk where Scherzinger walks into a telephone booth as several men in black suits pass by the booth . As Scherzinger begins to undress , the men stop to stare as she begins taking of her glasses and shaking her hair back . The video then moves to Scherzinger in a dress walking past four men mopping the floor to a supply closet where she enters and reappears moments later , dressed in a black body suit with a cape . As the chorus begins , the situation rapidly switches back @-@ and @-@ forth from Scherzinger in her good @-@ girl persona shown fighting escaped jail prisoners dressed in striped suits ( and Beagle Boys masks ) to Scherzinger in her bad @-@ girl persona fighting with police . As the song progresses , Scherzinger is shown in a classic looking automobile and riding a BMW motorcycle , with a streaking white and black background . Several shots of her bad @-@ girl persona alone in a room with two prisoners are then shown . As the bridge begins , she is shown in her good @-@ girl ego standing by a podium , talking to a group of reporters while waving her hands in the air . As the bridge ends , she brings her hands down , blowing back all of the reporters , who then begin dancing and pumping their arms to the song . The video moves to Scherzinger dancing with the police and prisoners before ending with her blowing away the two men who were in the room with her and walking away . 
 MTV 's Gil Kaufman called the video " slinky " . Robbie Daw from Idolator , said that " [ we were ] unsure about [ ... ] ' Poison ' when it first surfaced . But now that it ’ s been fitted with a somewhat stylish Joseph Kahn video , it ’ s all sort of starting to fall into place . ' Poison ' video is super hot trash on a budget . ..

After filming the remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers , Kaufman went to New York and successfully pitched The Wanderers to Martin Ransohoff . The film 's budget is unknown , but Kaufman said it was relatively low . 
 After an advance screening , The Wanderers premiered on July 13 , 1979 , to mostly positive reviews . The film was a financial success , grossing $ 23 million at the worldwide box office . On the review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes , the film has a rating of 89 percent . Peter Stack of the San Francisco Chronicle praised Kaufman 's directing and the performances of Wahl and Tony Ganios . 
 The film 's increasing popularity and cult status led to The Wanderers being given a theatrical re @-@ release in the U.S. by Warner Bros. in 1996 . According to Kaufman , " it took a long time for [ the film ] to find [ an ] audience " .

 Philip Kaufman and Richard Price unsuccessfully tried to pitch the project to Alberto Grimaldi . Because of this , Kaufman signed on to direct what would have been the first motion picture based on Star Trek : The Original Series ; called Star Trek : Planet of the Titans . Allan Scott and Chris Bryant were hired to write the film 's screenplay , but their attempt was rejected and Kaufman tried to write the screenplay himself . Before he could finish the screenplay , Paramount Pictures abandoned the project , saying there was no market for science @-@ fiction movies . After the Star Trek project was shelved , Kaufman directed the remake of Invasion of the Body Snatchers . When filming finished , he went to New York and successfully pitched The Wanderers to Martin Ransohoff . According to Kaufman , " the pieces somehow fell together " , partly because of the increasing popularity of gang movies .

 Kaufman 's wife Rose wrote the screenplay 's first draft . It took her several years to complete ; she found adapting the entire novel difficult . Some of the characters and stories from the novel were either changed or given retroactive continuity . Despite the differences , Richard Price approved of Kaufman 's adaptation , saying , " I love that picture . It 's not my book , and I don 't care . The spirit is right , and the way Phil Kaufman directed it showed me another way of looking at my own book . " 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 The casting process , which Kaufman described as " arduous " , began in New York City . He said teenagers from across the city wanted to audition . Academy Award @-@ winning producer Scott Rudin was the film 's casting director who found <unk> van Lidth and Linda Manz . There was no character named Peewee in the novel . Rudin had organized an interview with Manz . Kaufman and Price were present ; they all thought she had " great character " . Manz was so convincing that everyone assumed she was a real member of a street gang . Because of this , the character Peewee was specifically written for her . 
 Many of the film 's actors were unknown at the time of casting . The film was the acting debut of four cast members ; Ken Wahl , Tony Ganios , <unk> van Lidth and Michael Wright . It was also the feature film debut of Toni Kalem , who had previously acted on television . Kaufman intentionally cast unknown actors ; Wahl was on his way to a job in a pizza parlor when someone sent a photograph of him to Rudin , thinking he could play one of the smaller roles in the film . Kaufman felt Wahl was talented so he cast him in the lead role instead . 
 To cast the role of Perry LaGuardia , Kaufman telephoned every gymnasium around New York asking for a " six @-@ foot , four inch , 18 year @-@ old kid " . He was put into contact with Ganios , who he cast in the role . Ganios said : 
 After a mysterious phone call , [ my uncle ] politely asked me to stop training and get dressed . He ' insisted ' that I accompany him downtown to what was supposed to be a commercial audition , [ but it later ] turned out to be an interview for The Wanderers . I thought acting was for sissies , but I went anyway . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Filming of The Wanderers began in September 1978 , most of which occurred in the Bronx . Kaufman said that during filming , " [ This ] Puerto Rican motorcycle gang came pushing its way through the crowd ; wanting to see what was going on " , and " they pushed everyone aside " . They walked away after bumping into van Lidth . The crew also encountered trouble from former members of the " real " Baldies , who complained the film portrayed the Baldies incorrectly , saying : " [ The movie ] is a lie ! This was not a bad neighborhood . There was no crime , no robbery . Murder , yes , but no crime ! " Rose Kaufman eventually told them to " fuck off " , which nearly resulted in a brawl between the former gang members , Wahl and several other actors . 
 The final battle with the Ducky Boys , which takes place during a football game , was filmed in Van Cortlandt Park . Kaufman compared this scene to a " brutal British soccer brawl " ; Ganios compared it to the Battle of Mons Graupius . When asked further about this scene , Ganios said : 
 The final fight with the Ducky Boys was absolutely wild , [ and ] for all practical purposes it was real . For an entire week hundreds of screaming , stunted madmen — armed with real baseball bats , axe handles , and chains — hurled themselves at us in wave after wave of unabated Celtic fury . It got totally out of hand , with the mayhem sometimes continuing for a full five minutes after [ the director ] yelled cut .

 = Hurricane Lili ( 1984 ) = 
 Hurricane Lili was one of only five Atlantic tropical cyclones on record to reach hurricane status in the month of December . The final of thirteen tropical storms in the 1984 Atlantic hurricane season , Lili developed as a subtropical cyclone which originated from a frontal trough to the south of Bermuda on December 12 . It tracked southeastward , then northward , slowly attaining tropical characteristics and becoming a hurricane on December 20 . Lili turned to the south and southwest , briefly threatening the northern Caribbean islands before weakening and dissipating near the coast of the Dominican Republic . The storm produced light rainfall but no damage . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 In the second week of December , a frontal trough stalled south of Bermuda . An upper level disturbance moved over the area on December 9 , and produced widespread convection along the frontal wave . The system moved to the northeast , and based on a developing circulation within the convection , the National Hurricane Center classified the system as a subtropical storm on December 12 while located 275 miles ( 440 km ) northeast of Bermuda . 
 With winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) and strengthening , the subtropical storm initially drifted northeastward . On December 13 , a ridge of high pressure to its north forced the storm southeastward , and the following day the storm turned to the south after an upper @-@ level cold @-@ core low developed over the system . A break in the ridge resulted in the storm turning to the northeast , with its forward motion accelerating to nearly 40 mph ( 65 km / h ) . After turning to the northwest on December 17 , the high pressure system again halted its northward movement , leaving the storm drifting south @-@ southeastward . Conditions favored further strengthening , and the subtropical storm reached 70 mph ( 115 km / h ) winds on December 18 . Satellite imagery estimated the storm attained hurricane status on December 19 , and a day later ship near the center reported winds of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) . Based on the wind report , as well as a minimum central pressure of 980 mbar and a well @-@ defined eye , the storm was classified as Hurricane Lili while located 730 miles ( 1 @,@ 180 km ) east of Bermuda . 
 Lili continued generally southward , reaching its peak intensity of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) . Higher pressures developed to its northeast , resulting in the hurricane to accelerate to the southwest . On December 22 , Lili finished executing its large cyclonic loop by passing over the same location it passed one week prior . The combination of its increased forward speed , as well as increased levels of vertical wind shear , created an unfavorable environment which caused steady weakening . On December 23 , Lili weakened to a tropical storm while located 430 miles ( 690 km ) northeast of Antigua . It rapidly lost organization as it approached the Leeward Islands , and dissipated just off the coast of the Dominican Republic on December 24 . 
 = = Impact and records = = 
 When Lili reached hurricane status on December 20 , it became one of only four Atlantic tropical cyclones to reach hurricane strength in the month of December . The other three were an unnamed hurricane in the 1887 season , Hurricane Alice in 1954 , and Hurricane Epsilon in 2005 . In addition , Hurricane Nicole lasted as a hurricane from late November to early December 1998 . 
 Because of its rapid movement , a hurricane watch was issued for Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands on December 22 . As the storm weakened , the watches were discontinued . In response to the threat of the hurricane , officials posted a small craft advisory along the coastline of northern Puerto Rico . There , the weakening tropical cyclone produced light rainfall , though there was no reported damage . Lili moved through Hispaniola as an area of squally weather , but damage , if any , is unknown .

 The compilation album received universal critical acclaim from music critics . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic gave the collection five stars and compared it to Greatest Hits : My Prerogative , saying that although they had the same length , they were " different listening experiences " . He also noted that the more recent tracks " help push The Singles away from teen pop and toward pure dance @-@ pop bliss . [ ... ] It does result in a stronger overall listen , since there are no slow patches here , just a parade of relentless hooks and rhythms that wound up defining the sound of a decade " . Mayer Nissim of Digital Spy also gave the album five stars stating that " [ it ] perfectly captures the career of one of the best singles artists of the last ten years . Running from ' ... Baby One More Time ' to ' Radar ' , you get a single @-@ disc timeline that shows a progression in style and substance from school uniform @-@ wearing pop ingénue to sultry motorik <unk> . [ ... ] The only arguable weak link is the Madonna @-@ featuring ' Me Against the Music ' , but in this context what once looked like a respectful passing of the baton now seems like an unconditional surrender of pop Queendom to its rightful heir . " The reviewer also noted the impact on popular culture and pop music of Spears , highlighting " Oops ! ... I Did It Again " , " Toxic " and " Stronger " . 
 Brian Linder of IGN commented " 2004 's Greatest Hits : My Prerogative [ ... ] captured the highlights from Britney 's heyday , but lacks the more mature club @-@ oriented material that she 's churned out in recent years . That helps make this collection a justifiable fan purchase " . Mike Diver of BBC Online called it " the definitive Britney album " and added that " these songs don 't just make a mark , lingering in the memory – they are essential pieces of the past ten years of pop history , and deserve better than dismissal by so @-@ called discerning listeners " . Evan Sawdey of PopMatters called the album " a high @-@ gloss collection of tunes that selectively sums up the career of one of the biggest female pop singers of the past decade . It 's a disc that 's light on filler [ ... ] and heavy on Spears ' more high @-@ energy cuts , which , without question , play to her strengths as a performer " . Sputnikmusic stated " This is Britney 's second greatest hits , and it 's incredibly strong . It focuses mainly on her more upbeat , danceable numbers , with a few slower ones thrown in to change things up without disrupting the constant stream of quality pop songs " and summarized the review adding " As one of the most successful artists of the decade , is it any wonder this compilation is so good ?

 = SMS Kaiser Barbarossa = 
 SMS Kaiser Barbarossa ( His Majesty 's Ship Emperor Barbarossa ) was a German pre @-@ dreadnought battleship of the Kaiser Friedrich III class . The ship was built for the Imperial Navy , which had begun a program of expansion at the direction of Kaiser Wilhelm II . She was constructed at Schichau , in Danzig . Kaiser Barbarossa was laid down in August 1898 , launched on 24 April 1900 , and commissioned in June 1901 , at the cost of 20 @,@ 301 @,@ 000 Marks . The ship was armed with a main battery of four 24 @-@ centimeter ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) guns in two twin gun turrets . 
 Kaiser Barbarossa served with the German navy from her commissioning in 1901 , though her active career was limited by two lengthy stays in dry @-@ dock . The first was for repairs following damage to her rudder in 1903 , which lasted until early 1905 , and the second for a major modernization , which began immediately after the conclusion of repair work in 1905 and lasted until late 1907 . She returned to service for another two years , before being decommissioned in 1909 and placed in the reserve division . She continued to participate in fleet training exercises for the next three years . 
 Following the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , Kaiser Barbarossa and her sisters were mobilized as coastal defense ships in the V Battle Squadron and assigned to the North and Baltic Seas . She saw no combat during the war , and due to a shortage of crews , the ships were withdrawn from active duty in February 1915 and relegated to secondary duties . Kaiser Barbarossa was briefly used as a torpedo target ship for most of 1915 and thereafter spent the remainder of the war as a prison ship in Wilhelmshaven . Following the end of the war in 1918 , Kaiser Barbarossa was decommissioned and sold for scrap metal . The ship was broken up in 1919 – 20 . 
 = = Design = = 
 Kaiser Barbarossa was 125 @.@ 3 m ( 411 ft 1 in ) long overall and had a beam of 20 @.@ 4 m ( 66 ft 11 in ) and a draft of 7 @.@ 89 m ( 25 ft 11 in ) forward and 8 @.@ 25 m ( 27 ft 1 in ) aft . She displaced up to 11 @,@ 785 metric tons ( 11 @,@ 599 long tons ) at full load . The ship was powered by three 3 @-@ cylinder vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving one screw propeller . Steam was provided by four Thornycroft boilers and eight cylindrical boilers , all of which burned coal . Kaiser Barbarossa 's powerplant was rated at 13 @,@ 000 metric horsepower ( 12 @,@ 820 ihp ; 9 @,@ 560 kW ) , which generated a top speed of 17 @.@ 5 knots ( 32 @.@ 4 km / h ; 20 @.@ 1 mph ) . The ship had a cruising radius of 3 @,@ 420 nmi ( 6 @,@ 330 km ; 3 @,@ 940 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) . She had a normal crew of 39 officers and 612 enlisted men . 
 The ship 's armament consisted of a main battery of four 24 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) SK L / 40 guns in twin gun turrets , one fore and one aft of the central superstructure . Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 inch ) SK L / 40 guns , twelve 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 45 in ) SK L / 30 quick @-@ firing guns all mounted in casemates , and twelve 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) machine cannon in single mounts . The armament suite was rounded out with six 45 cm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes , all in above @-@ water swivel mounts . The ship 's belt armor was 300 mm ( 11 @.@ 8 in ) thick , and the deck was 65 mm ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) thick . The conning tower and main battery turrets were protected with 250 mm ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) of armor plating , and the secondary casemates received 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) of armor protection . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Kaiser Wilhelm II , the Emperor of Germany , believed that a strong navy was necessary for the country to expand its influence outside continental Europe . As a result , he initiated a program of naval expansion in the late 1880s ; the first battleships built under this program were the four Brandenburg @-@ class ships . These were immediately followed by the five Kaiser Friedrich III @-@ class battleships , of which Kaiser Barbarossa was a member . Kaiser Barbarossa 's keel was laid down on 3 August 1898 , at the Schichau @-@ Werke in Danzig , under construction number 640 . She was ordered under the contract name " A " as an addition to the fleet . Kaiser Barbarossa was launched on 21 April 1900 . The then @-@ Vizeadmiral ( Vice Admiral ) Alfred von Tirpitz , the State Secretary of the Reichsmarineamt ( RMA — Imperial Navy Office ) , gave the launching speech , and the new battleship was christened by Princess Luise Sofie of Prussia , Wilhelm II 's sister @-@ in @-@ law . Sea trials began on 4 May 1901 , during which two tests were recorded : a 50 @-@ hour endurance test and a 6 @-@ hour speed test . The former produced a sustained speed of 15 @.@ 5 knots ( 28 @.@ 7 km / h ; 17 @.@ 8 mph ) , while the latter saw a maximum speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) , and on 10 June she was commissioned into the fleet in Kiel . The final cost of the vessel was 20 @,@ 301 @,@ 000 marks . 
 Following her commissioning , Kaiser Barbarossa was assigned to the I Squadron of the Heimatflotte ( Home Fleet ) , which shortly thereafter went on a cruise to Spain . While moored in Cadiz , the ships met the four Brandenburg @-@ class ships , which were returning from their expedition to suppress the Boxer Rebellion in China . From 22 August to 21 September , Kaiser Barbarossa participated in the annual autumn maneuvers of the entire fleet . While in the Danzig Bay , the fleet conducted a naval review for the visiting Tsar Nicholas II of Russia . The winter cruise in December went to southern Norway . In April and May 1902 , the squadron went on a training cruise to Britain , followed by a tour of the Kiel Week sailing regatta in late June . The ships then took part in another training cruise to Norway in July and then the autumn maneuvers , which began in the Baltic and concluded in the North Sea with a fleet review in the Jade . During the exercise , which lasted from 17 August to 18 September , Kaiser Barbarossa and the rest of I Squadron were assigned to play the roles of both the German fleet and hostile forces . The usual winter cruise went to Bergen , Norway , that year . 
 In 1903 , the fleet , which was composed of only one squadron of modern battleships , was reorganized as the " Active Battle Fleet . " Kaiser Barbarossa remained in the I Squadron along with her sister ships and the newest Wittelsbach @-@ class battleships , while the older Brandenburg @-@ class ships were placed in reserve in order to be rebuilt . The first quarter of 1903 followed the usual pattern of training exercises . The squadron went on a training cruise in the Baltic , followed by a voyage to Spain that lasted from 7 May to 10 June . The ship suffered some damage to her rudder , which necessitated temporary repairs at the Kaiserliche Werft ( Imperial Shipyard ) in Kiel from the end of July to 21 August . She thereafter took part in the autumn maneuvers and the winter cruise in the eastern Baltic and the Skagerrak . The autumn maneuvers consisted of a blockade exercise in the North Sea , a cruise of the entire fleet first to Norwegian waters and then to Kiel in early September , and finally a mock attack on Kiel . The exercises concluded on 12 September . The winter training cruise began on 23 November in the eastern Baltic and continued into the Skagerrak in early December . On 15 December , Kaiser Barbarossa was decommissioned for permanent repairs to her rudder , which lasted until January 1905 . She did not return to service , however , and instead began a major reconstruction . 
 During the modernization , four of her 15 cm guns were removed and two 8 @.@ 8 cm guns were added . All twelve 1 @-@ pounder guns were removed , as was the ship 's stern @-@ mounted torpedo tube . Kaiser Barbarossa 's superstructure was also cut down to reduce the ship 's tendency to roll excessively and her military masts were replaced with lighter pole masts . The ship 's funnels were also lengthened . Kaiser Barbarossa 's modernization was completed by 1 October 1907 , when she was recommissioned for service . By that time , the newest Deutschland @-@ class battleships were coming into service ; along with the Braunschweig @-@ class battleships , these provided enough modern battleships to create two full battle squadrons . Consequently , the Heimatflotte was renamed the Hochseeflotte ( High Seas Fleet ) . Kaiser Barbarossa returned to her place in the I Squadron and she participated in the normal routine of divisional , squadron , and fleet maneuvers and cruises without incident over the next year . The summer fleet cruise in May that year went to the Azores and returned to Kiel on 13 August . The autumn maneuvers lasted from 27 August to 7 September . Divisional exercises in the Baltic immediately followed from 7 to 13 September . 
 On 17 September 1909 , Kaiser Barbarossa was decommissioned and assigned to the Reserve Division in the Baltic Sea . By that time , the new dreadnought battleships , which rendered Kaiser Barbarossa and her sister ships thoroughly obsolete , were beginning to come into service with the fleet . In early 1910 , Kaiser Barbarossa was assigned to the Training Squadron , which operated in the Baltic in April . She was reactivated to participate in the autumn maneuvers that year in the provisional III Squadron ; after the conclusion of the exercises on 10 September , she was placed back in reserve . More modernization work was done at the Kaiserliche Werft in Kiel . From 31 July to 15 September , she was reactivated again to take part in the autumn maneuvers in the III Squadron . She thereafter returned to the Reserve Division in early 1912 .
