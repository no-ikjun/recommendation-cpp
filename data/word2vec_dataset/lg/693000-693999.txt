 = William Henry Cushing = 
 William Henry Cushing ( August 21 , 1852 – January 25 , 1934 ) was a Canadian politician . Born in Ontario , he migrated west as a young adult where he started a successful lumber company and later became Alberta 's first Minister of Public Works and the 11th mayor of Calgary . As Minister of Public Works in the government of Alexander Cameron Rutherford , he oversaw the creation of Alberta Government Telephones . 
 Cushing 's resignation in 1910 precipitated the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway scandal , which forced Rutherford 's resignation . Though Cushing had hopes of being asked to replace Rutherford , that role fell instead to Arthur Sifton , the province 's chief judge . Left out of Sifton 's cabinet , Cushing did not seek re @-@ election in the 1913 election , and did not re @-@ enter politics thereafter . He was the chairman of Mount Royal College 's board of governors for sixteen years . He died in 1934 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Cushing was born August 21 , 1852 in Kenilworth , Ontario to William <unk> and Sarah Thomson . His father was a farmer who had immigrated from Norwich , England in 1840 . In 1879 , Cushing indentured as a carpenter . He moved to Calgary in 1883 , where in partnership with Stephen Jarett , he engaged in carpentry , building houses and stores . In 1877 Cushing married Elizabeth Rinn , who died three years later . In 1883 he married Mary Jane Waters , with whom he had two children . In 1885 he opened a sash and door factory , which made him wealthy . His business flourished and expanded ; by 1900 , it occupied 42 city lots and employed more than one hundred workers ; by 1911 , this number had reached two hundred . He was also active in the local Methodist church and the Bowness golf club , and served eight years as a school trustee with the Calgary Board of Education . He was a supporter of the Temperance Movement .

 Cushing was elected Calgary town councillor for a term beginning on January 20 , 1890 . He remained in that capacity until January 16 , 1893 . Two years later he became an alderman on the council of Calgary , which was now a city . He served as alderman from January 7 , 1895 until January 4 , 1897 , and again from May 1899 until January 2 , 1900 . During his last term he was elected the thirteenth mayor of Calgary , a position he held from January 2 , 1900 until January 7 , 1901 . He subsequently served another term as alderman from January 6 , 1902 until January 2 , 1905 . 
 He also served as the president of Calgary 's Board of Trade in 1906 . 
 = = Provincial politics = = 
 After Alexander Cameron Rutherford was asked to form Alberta 's first government in 1905 , he appointed Cushing as his Minister of Public Works . Historian L. G. Thomas notes that this was an important portfolio , given the rapid development of infrastructure expected in the new province . In keeping with custom for cabinet ministers in Westminster parliamentary systems , Cushing ran for the first Legislative Assembly of Alberta in the district of Calgary in the 1905 election . Cushing , a Liberal , was opposed by Conservative leader R. B. Bennett . The campaign was acrimonious ; at one meeting , Bennett accused Cushing of giving his fellow Liberal candidates road @-@ building money with which they could bribe their districts . On election day , Cushing defeated Bennett , who attributed his defeat to " Roman Catholic influence " . 
 Once elected , he was Calgary 's primary supporter in the legislature 's debate over Alberta 's capital city , claiming that it was the new province 's economic centre , that Alberta 's status as a province was the result of a political movement that had begun in Calgary , and that it would be cheaper to build a legislature there than in Edmonton , site of the interim capital . His motion to name Calgary as the capital was defeated 16 votes to eight , and permanent capital was located at Edmonton . Though it was not to be at his preferred location , as Public Works Minister Cushing did choose the design for the new Alberta Legislature Building , which was based on the Minnesota State Capitol . 
 As Calgary 's representative , Cushing was further dismayed when Rutherford elected to locate the University of Alberta in his own hometown of Strathcona , immediately across the North Saskatchewan River from Edmonton . Calgarians felt that , having been denied the capital , they should be first in line for the university . 
 As Public Works Minister , Cushing was a primary advocate of government intervention in the labour disputes plaguing Alberta 's coal industry in 1907 ; Rutherford eventually appointed a commission to examine the problem . Cushing also presided over the government 's entry into the telephone business : in 1906 , most telephone lines in Alberta were privately owned , and the largest of these private owners was the Bell Telephone Company . Bell controlled all telephone service in Calgary , and refused to extend its operations into less densely populated , and therefore less profitable , regions of the province . In response , Cushing attacked Bell as " the most pernicious and iniquitous monopoly that had ever been foisted upon a people claiming to be free " and sponsored legislation creating Alberta Government Telephones to service areas that Bell would not . This new company later purchased Bell 's lines , financing the venture by issuing debentures , in contrast to the government 's usual policy of " pay as you go " . Cushing 's zeal for government involvement was such that member of the Canadian House of Commons Peter Talbot in 1908 warned Rutherford that his Public Works Minister was " going crazy " with public ownership and that Rutherford would " someday find a lot of trouble through him " . Thomas has argued that it was strange for a successful businessman like Cushing to be so aggressive rhetorically against a successful corporation , but Mount Royal College historian Patricia Roome has suggested that Cushing was soured by his own experience as a Calgarian living under the monopoly , hostile to what he saw as a symbol of " eastern capitalism " , and hopeful that bringing telephone service to rural areas would guarantee continued Liberal success . 
 = = = Railway scandal = = = 
 By the 1909 election , Calgary 's growth had earned it a second seat in the legislature . Cushing finished first in a five candidate field , and was elected to fill one of these seats ; Bennett , finishing second , was elected to the other . 
 Though Cushing , as Minister of Public Works , was initially responsible for railway policy , on November 1 , 1909 Rutherford created a new ministry of Railways , which he appointed himself to head . In February 1910 , Cushing resigned as Minister of Public Works , expressing disagreement with Rutherford 's policy of offering loan guarantees to private railway builders , including the Alberta and Great Waterways ( A & GW ) Railway . He stated in his letter of resignation that this policy had been adopted without his knowledge or consent . Rutherford accepted the resignation with regret , but publicly disagreed with Cushing 's claim that he had been kept unaware of government railway policy . On February 25 , Cushing gave his account of the events leading to his resignation In the legislature : after responsibility for railways was removed from his department , Rutherford had offered the A & GW guarantees of $ 20 @,@ 000 per mile of railway constructed . In making this guarantee , Rutherford had not consulted government engineers in the department of Public Works about construction costs , relying instead on the A & GW 's engineer . Cushing felt that guaranteeing $ 20 @,@ 000 per mile , regardless of actual construction costs , was unwise , and further believed that the government 's reliance on the A & GW 's engineer could let the company get away with building a sub @-@ standard railway . 
 There followed a dramatic series of legislative debates and votes , in which many Liberals , including Cushing , frequently voted against their own government , even on motions of non @-@ confidence . In March , Rutherford invited Cushing to rejoin the cabinet ; according to Cushing , he was assured that if he did so his rival , Attorney General Charles Wilson Cross , would resign . He declined Rutherford 's offer , both because he considered that he was no longer able to work with the premier and because his allies among the anti @-@ Rutherford Liberals urged him to fight on . Rumours began to circulate that Rutherford would resign , to be replaced by Cushing . Lieutenant Governor of Alberta George Bulyea was indeed convinced that Rutherford would have to resign in order to save the Liberals , but he and other powerful Liberals did not view Cushing as capable of leading the government . Bulyea instead invited provincial Chief Justice Arthur Sifton to form a government , though Cushing was reputed to have been " sitting in his hotel room , his ear glued to the telephone , waiting for the summons from the Lieutenant @-@ Governor to assume the robes of Rutherford " . 
 Sifton left Cushing , along with all other major figures of the A & GW dispute , out of his first cabinet ; Ezra Riley , a staunch Cushing ally , resigned his seat in protest . Cushing did not do the same , but did not seek re @-@ election in the 1913 election . 
 = = Later life and legacy = = 
 Cushing was the first chairman of the Mount Royal College Board of Governors , holding the post from 1910 until 1926 , when he was designated Honorary Chairman . He died in Calgary January 25 , 1934 of a heart attack . Calgary 's W. H. Cushing Workplace School is named in his honour . 
 Cushing is primarily remembered for his role in the Alberta and Great Waterways Railway Scandal . In assessing his role in that episode , Thomas has suggested that his actions were motivated by something other than " revulsion against what appeared to be an unwise contract with a railway company " . Instead , he believes that Cushing had concluded that he , rather than Rutherford , should be premier , and began to conduct himself publicly in such a way as to undermine Rutherford 's authority . Whatever his motivations , Cushing 's resignation precipitated a scandal that ended Alexander Rutherford 's political career , and in so doing had a profound effect on Alberta 's political history . In evaluating his legacy , Roome also considers his role in establishing the government telephone system , which in her opinion " produced serious financial difficulties " for the province in the years ahead .

 Four elderly men meet for coffee late at night . The fourth to arrive is hostile to the waiter , who secretly urinates in the man 's coffee . The man , Abum ( Dick <unk> ) , realizes this , and the group share a laugh over it , during which they are revealed to actually be demons . One of them , Blurk ( Bill Macy ) , complains that there are no strong personalities in this century . He tells a story of Perry , a man he met hitch @-@ hiking , who he molded into a serial killer over encouraging conversations . Perry sought to emulate Johnny Mack Potter , the country 's most prolific killer , and to break his record number of murders . As Perry drew level with Potter 's figure , Blurk grew bored accompanying him on the " mundane " murders of prostitutes and vagrants . Blurk gave an anonymous tip to the police that leads to Perry 's arrest ; one of the men present at the arrest — offender profiler Frank Black ( Lance Henriksen ) — seems to see through Blurk 's human disguise . In prison , Perry is murdered by his cellmate Johnny Mack Potter , reclaiming his record . 
 Abum tells another story , which he believes shows that mankind no longer needs demonic temptation to be damned . Abum followed an everyman figure called Brock , watching his grindingly repetitive life . Brock visited a strip club often but without joy , which led Abum to believe he no longer took pleasure from sinning . One day , Abum added an additional irritation to Brock 's life , posing as a traffic warden and giving him a ticket . This was enough to drive Brock to suicide . However , during this time , Abum also encountered Black , who again saw his demonic nature . 
 Greb ( Alex Diakun ) shares his tale , of a television censor called Waylon Figgleif . Figgleif 's overzealous approach to censorship leads Greb to try pushing his limits . Greb assumed the form of a small demonic baby and reveals himself to Figgleif , who breaks down and starts attempting to censor everyday life . Greb repeats this trick , and encourages Figgleif to go on a killing spree — Figgleif takes a gun , bursts onto the taping of a science @-@ fiction show about alien abduction , and kills several actors . Greb 's methods and effectiveness are dismissed until he reveals the story 's epigram . Figgleif 's spree was caught on camera , and broadcast by another network as a found footage special . However , Greb also notes that he too was spotted by Black during this . 
 The fourth devil , Toby ( Wally Dalton ) , is convinced that Black really does know that they are demons . Toby also recounts his story , in which he begins to feel ennui at his failure to damn humans for some time . He meets and courts an aging stripper , Sally , who falls in love with him . Their relationship blossomed , despite her having seen his true demonic form . One day Toby leads her to believe he is about to propose to her , before instead curtly insulting and breaking up with her . He later visited her home to find police investigating her suicide — a successful damnation . However , he also encounters Black , who sees his true nature . Instead of recoiling or reacting , Black simply tells Toby that he sees how lonely he must be . Toby 's story affects all the gathered demons , who realize how lonely they really are . As they get up to leave , Abum praises the shop 's coffee and briefly reveals his true form to the waiter .

 " Somehow , Satan Got Behind Me " is the second , and last , episode of Millennium to have been written by Darin Morgan , who also directed the episode . Morgan had previously written and directed " Jose Chung 's Doomsday Defense " earlier in the season . Morgan also served as a consulting producer for the season , and is the younger brother of Glen Morgan , an executive producer for the series . 
 Morgan 's script contains several references to his time as a writer for Millennium 's sister show , The X @-@ Files . One of Morgan 's episodes for that series , " War of the Coprophages " , had come under heavy criticism by the standards and practices department at parent network Fox , who took exception to the initial script 's heavy use of words such as " crap " to refer to the excrement that episode 's cockroaches fed upon . Morgan attacked and parodied this approach with one of the tales in " Somehow , Satan Got Behind Me " , with a network censor again targeting the use of the word " crap " and storming onto the set of a show resembling The X @-@ Files being taped , featuring lookalikes of Fox Mulder and Dana Scully with theme music very similar to that series ' playing in the background . The episode also contains a version of the dancing baby animation that was popular at the time , parodying its use on the series Ally McBeal . 
 Guest star Alex Diakun had previously appeared in the first season episode " Lamentation " in an unrelated role ; while Dan <unk> , who played network censor Waylon Figgleif , had also appeared in a small role in " Jose Chung 's Doomsday Defense " .

 Blown for Good : Behind the Iron Curtain of Scientology is a memoir written by Marc Headley , a former Scientologist and Sea Org member , about his life and experiences in the Church of Scientology . It was self @-@ published in the United States on November 5 , 2009 . 
 = = Background = = 
 Marc Headley was raised in Los Angeles , California . Headley 's mother was a Scientologist , and she raised him within the church from an early age . He began work as an employee for the church at age 16 . Headley soon after joined the Sea Org and worked at the international headquarters of Scientology in Hemet , California , for 15 years . Headley claims he escaped from the international headquarters of the organization in 2006 . He received the help of police during his escape from the organization . 
 In Headley v. Church of Scientology International , the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals wrote , " The record overwhelmingly shows that the Headleys joined and voluntarily worked for the [ Sea Organization ] because they believed that it was the right thing to do , because they enjoyed it , and because they thought that by working they were honoring the commitment that they each made and to which they adhered . " The court also noted that the Headleys had private quarters outside the base , and had access to vehicles and multiple opportunities to leave . 
 After leaving the organization , Headley wrote about his experiences in Scientology . His writings were published in the media including news magazines , publications on the internet and other websites . In 2008 , Headley was invited to speak in Hamburg , Germany , at a conference discussing abuses within Scientology , alongside actor and former Scientologist Jason Beghe . In 2009 , Headley lived in Los Angeles , California , with his wife and two children , where he opened a business . 
 = = Contents = = 
 The book 's title is a reference to the Scientology terms " blow " or " blown , " which describe one who leaves Scientology without prior authorization from the organization . 
 Headley recounts episodes from his years as a member of the Church of Scientology , most of that time as part of the order called the Sea Organization , or Sea Org . He details his experiences while working hundred @-@ hour weeks at Scientology 's secluded international headquarters known as Gold Base ( or " Int Base " ) at Gilman Hot Springs , California , about eighty miles southeast of Los Angeles . 
 The book includes a forward written by former high @-@ ranking Scientology official Mark Rathbun .

 Headley worked out of the film @-@ production studio facilities of Scientology from 1989 through 2005 . He held multiple positions while employed by Scientology at Gold Base , mainly focused on the production of video and audio materials to disseminate the message of Scientology founder L. Ron Hubbard . He helped originate scripts of videos to introduce new members to Scientology methodology . He also supervised large scale Scientology public events presided over by Scientology 's leader David Miscavige . Headley reproduced thousands of copies of audio recordings of speeches by Hubbard .

 The author describes a 2004 event where Tom Cruise was awarded the organization 's Medal of Valor from David Miscavige , the video of which was leaked to the Internet in January 2008 . Initially , the video intended for the event featured Cruise and other celebrities including Will Smith appearing on camera and praising the actor . Miscavige disapproved and instructed Scientology staff to create a video where Cruise would speak about himself and his views on being a Scientologist . " Dave Miscavige later said that his Tom Cruise video was one of the most important videos that had ever been produced , " writes Headley . 
 = = = Departure from Scientology = = = 
 Headley states he gained approval to sell old Scientology materials on eBay to recoup money for the organization – he was later accused of embezzlement for doing this . In 2005 , when he knew he would be faced with being sent to the organization 's prison @-@ like program the Rehabilitation Project Force , Headley decided to leave . Headley worried that leaving Scientology would mean becoming separated from his wife Claire , to whom he had been married for 13 years , and other family members in accordance with the Scientology practice of disconnection . Headley alleges that left Gold Base on his motorcycle but was followed by Scientology security guards , which resulted in Headley falling off his bike by the side of the road . Riverside County , California police arrived , and they helped Headley safely get further away from the Scientology compound . From there he traveled to his father in Kansas City . He was later reunited with his wife who had also been an employee at Gold Base . Prior to his wife 's departure from Gold Base , she was monitored closely day and night by the organization . 
 The author credits multiple sources for introducing doubts about his conditions while living at Gold Base . He writes that he listened to The John and Ken Show on KFI , and that their discussion of Scientology allowed him to think more critically during his time at the compound . He says that viewing Conan O 'Brien make fun of Scientology celebrities changed his views on individuals that the organization had only spoken of internally with reverence .

 When Headley and a Danish film crew went to the Gold Base , Headley was confronted by Gold staff , Catherine Fraser , who said Headley 's account of his escape was untrue . 
 " Marc lived in another place , not even on the property , another place altogether , " Fraser said in one of the [ video clips of the incident ] . " And that day when I explained that to the sheriff -- the sheriff looked at me and said , ' Oh , you mean he could have left at any time ? ' I said , ' Yes , he could have left at any time and he did . ' " 
 After reviewing the evidence , the 9th Circuit agreed with the Scientologists that the Headleys lived outside the base , they had many opportunities to leave the Gold staff , and they had no problem leaving on their first try .

 In an interview on The John and Ken Show on KFI , Headley was asked if he experienced retaliation from Scientology for speaking critically about the organization .

' If you are in Scientology , and you speak to somebody who is a Suppressive Person , you yourself can be declared a Suppressive Person . " Headley said when he left Scientology the organization gave him a " freeloader statement " , a bill for US $ 62 @,@ 000 , for courses he had received in Scientology . " It 's actually illegal , because they are basically charging me for on @-@ the @-@ job training – in California you can 't charge somebody for on @-@ the @-@ job training . It 's of no real value , but you don 't know that , when you 're in Scientology . You think , ' Are they going to garnish my wages , are they going to sue me ? ' You don 't know , " said Headley .

 = Threni ( Stravinsky ) = 
 Threni : id est Lamentationes Jeremiae Prophetae , usually referred to simply as Threni , is a musical setting by Igor Stravinsky of verses from the Book of Lamentations in the Latin of the Vulgate , for solo singers , chorus and orchestra . It is important among Stravinsky 's compositions as his first and longest completely dodecaphonic work , but is not often performed . It has been described as " austere " but also as a " culminating point " in his career as an artist , " important both spiritually and stylistically " and " the most ambitious and structurally the most complex " of all his religious compositions , and even " among Stravinsky 's greatest works " . 
 Stravinsky composed Threni in 1957 – 1958 for the Venice Biennale , and it was first performed there in September 1958 . A performance in Paris two months later was a disaster , attributed to inadequate performers and insufficient rehearsals . It led to mutual recriminations between Stravinsky , Pierre Boulez and Robert Craft . The work was first published in 1958 and first recorded in 1959 , in a recording conducted by the composer . 
 As Threni was intended for concert rather than liturgical use , Stravinsky chose the text freely from the early chapters of the Book of Lamentations . It has three movements : the large central movement is surrounded by two much shorter ones . Ernst Krenek composed a setting of the Lamentations in 1942 , and Stravinsky acknowledged that it might have influenced him . He considered it less likely that works by Renaissance composers , including Tallis , Byrd and Palestrina , had influenced him , although he had studied such music . 
 = = History = = 
 Stravinsky composed Threni between the summer of 1957 and the spring of 1958 , beginning it on 29 August 1957 at the piano of the nightclub in the hotel where he was staying in Venice , and completing it before 27 March of the next year . It was first performed on 23 September 1958 in the hall of the Scuola Grande di San Rocco , Venice . Stravinsky dedicated the performance to Alessandro <unk> , director of the Venice Biennale , who had recently died . 
 The first Paris performance , on 14 November 1958 , was disastrous . According to Stephen Walsh , Pierre Boulez failed to fulfil his undertaking to obtain adequate performers , and those that he could obtain broke down several times . The audience response was polite at first , but when Stravinsky refused to return and take a bow , it gradually descended into jeers . Stravinsky said he would never conduct in Paris again . Stravinsky felt humiliated by what he called a " scandalous concert " , writing in his diary immediately after the performance that it was the " unhappiest concert of my life " and blaming Boulez for the result . Robert Craft adds that Boulez had promised to rehearse Threni , but failed to do so . Stravinsky nevertheless had a share in the blame for not cancelling the concert despite the pleas of family and friends , including his wife and Nadia Boulanger . Conceding that the performance was a " catastrophe " , Boulez nevertheless insisted that he did in fact participate in the piano rehearsals , together with Stravinsky , whom he had tried in vain to persuade to be more firm with the singers . He concluded that Stravinsky " was not a good conductor ; he was a terribly lousy conductor " , and the problems with the singers were compounded because " the orchestra had been ill @-@ prepared by Craft " . While agreeing that the singers were " absolutely awful " , Boulez protested they had been chosen not by himself , but by an agent in charge of the Aix @-@ en @-@ Provence festival . 
 Stravinsky himself conducted the first recording in January 1959 with the Columbia Symphony Orchestra . This recording has been reissued several times since first being published on LP in 1959 , and forms part of the 2007 release of Stravinsky 's works by Sony . 
 Threni was first published by Boosey & Hawkes in 1958 . Conducting from this score is difficult because of a shortage of bar lines . Asked by Robert Craft about this , Stravinsky said , " The voices are not always in rhythmic unison . Therefore , any bar lines would cut at least one line arbitrarily " . He recommended the conductor to " merely count the music out as he counts out a motet by Josquin " . However , a revised edition , with several changes to the barring as well as some corrections , was issued in 1965 . 
 Stravinsky had already used twelve @-@ tone technique earlier in the 1950s , both in Canticum Sacrum ( 1955 ) and in Agon ( 1957 ) . But neither of these is exclusively dodecaphonic , whereas Threni is . 
 = = Orchestration = = 
 Threni is scored for one soprano , one contralto , two tenor and two bass soloists , chorus and an orchestra of 2 flutes , 2 oboes , cor anglais , 2 clarinets ( second doubling alto clarinet in F ) , bass clarinet , contrabass <unk> , flugelhorn , 4 horns , 3 trombones ( 1 alto , 1 tenor , 1 bass ) , tuba , timpani , <unk> , harp , celesta , piano and strings . ( The flugelhorn is actually listed as " bugle " by the publisher , though in the " orchestration " list at the head of the score the specification is for " <unk> Bugle in B ♭ ( <unk> ) " , and in the score itself , where all the other instruments are named in Italian , it is called in French and German , " Bugle C @-@ alto ( <unk> ) " . However , the part is played on the flugelhorn . The French word for flugelhorn is bugle à pistons , and the Italian is <unk> . ) 
 = = General attributes = = 
 = = = Text = = = 
 Stravinsky wrote Threni for the Venice Biennale , not for liturgical use , and he chose the words himself to suit his musical purposes . The complete text is included in Kuster 's analysis . The text includes the Hebrew letters that begin the verses in some chapters of the Lamentations of Jeremiah . These are always set for chorus and have been likened to " a series of illuminated initials embellishing a manuscript " . 
 = = = Musical style = = = 
 Stravinsky himself described his treatment of pitch in Threni as " a kind of ' triadic atonality ' " , contrasting this with the " tonality repetition " of his ballet scores . Threni makes extensive use of canons . It also uses <unk> chanting in the choir – the first time Stravinsky had done this . 
 The score calls for a large orchestra , but never uses it in tutti , preferring small groups of individually selected instruments at any one time . 
 The principal 12 @-@ tone row for Threni is D ♯ -G ♯ -G ♮ -A ♯ -C ♯ -A ♮ -D ♮ -B ♮ -E ♮ -C ♮ -F ♮ -F ♯ . Stravinsky makes considerable use of the tonal – even diatonic – possibilities of this row . However , Stravinsky does not really use twelve @-@ tone technique in depth in this work , relying on free transposition and combination , selection , and repetition , so that the character of the music is actually not very different from his earlier works : the beginning of " Sensus spei " , for example ( especially the many repeated notes in the alto solo , and the repeated response from the chorus ) , recalls Renard and Les noces , and the two short passages for strings and chorus near the beginning setting the Hebrew letters <unk> and res are reminiscent of places in Orpheus ( 1948 ) . 
 = = = Influences = = = 
 The work most likely to have influenced Stravinsky 's Threni is the <unk> Jeremiae <unk> , opus 93 , by Ernst Krenek , for 8 @-@ part unaccompanied choir , composed in 1942 but only published in 1957 ( the year before Threni ) . Stravinsky himself said that he liked this work , that he had read a treatise by Krenek on twelve @-@ tone counterpoint , and that " Perhaps my own Threni shows contact with [ Krenek 's ] Lamentations . " Stravinsky 's decision to rely on a <unk> beat rather than on <unk> in the " Querimonia " section is one instance . 
 Edgar Murray finds Threni less expressive than the Krenek , and more like the Lamentationes of Thomas Tallis . Stravinsky , however , while acknowledging that he had studied the Tallis settings and works by William Byrd and Palestrina , did not believe that they had influenced his music . 
 Other resemblances have been observed – for example , the male @-@ quartet episode in the " Querimonia " was probably suggested by Carlo Gesualdo 's <unk> sum – though such things may be better characterized as " identifications " than " influences " . 
 The series used by Pierre Boulez in his Structures 1a is found in the sketches for Threni , but it differs so fundamentally from the row Stravinsky actually used that its relevance to Threni is unclear . 
 = = Movements = = 
 Threni has three movements , corresponding to the three chapters of the Lamentations of Jeremiah from which the texts used in the work are taken . The following is a summary . A detailed musical analysis and the complete Latin text , side by side with the English of the King James version of the Bible , are available in the thesis by Andrew Kuster . 
 = = = 1 . De Elegia Prima = = = 
 After a short orchestral introduction , the movement begins with the words " Incipit <unk> Jeremiae Prophetae " ( here begins the lamentation of the prophet Jeremiah ) , after which the music sets Lamentations chapter 1 , verses 1 , 2 ( first part ) , 5 ( first part ) , 11 ( last part ) and 20 . A Hebrew letter precedes each verse used . 
 = = = 2 . De Elegia Tertia = = = 
 This movement uses text from chapter 3 of Lamentations , with a Hebrew letter preceding each block of three verses . It is much longer than the other two movements combined , and is divided into three sections : 
 Querimonia 
 ( complaint ) uses verses 1 – 6 and 16 – 21 . 
 Sensus spei 
 ( sense of hope ) uses verses 22 – 27 , 34 – 36 , 40 – 45 and 49 – 57 . 
 <unk> 
 ( solace ) uses verses 58 – 64 . 
 = = = 3 . De Elegia Quinta = = = 
 This is by far the shortest movement of the work . It begins with the words " Oratio Jeremiae Prophetae " ( prayer of the prophet Jeremiah ) , after which the music sets Lamentations chapter 5 , verses 1 , 19 and 21 . No Hebrew letters are associated with this text .

 = Two Complete Science @-@ Adventure Books = 
 Two Complete Science @-@ Adventure Books was a pulp science fiction magazine , published by Fiction House , which lasted for eleven issues between 1950 and 1954 as a companion to Planet Stories . Each issue carried two novels or long novellas . It was initially intended to carry only reprints , but soon began to publish original stories . Well @-@ known contributors included Isaac Asimov , Robert A. Heinlein , Arthur C. Clarke , Poul Anderson , John Brunner , and James Blish . The magazine folded in 1954 , almost at the end of the pulp era . 
 = = Publication history = = 
 The early 1950s saw dramatic changes in the world of U.S. science fiction ( sf ) publishing . At the start of 1949 , all but one of the major magazines in the field were in pulp format ; by the end of 1955 , almost all had either ceased publication or switched to digest format . Despite the rapid decline of the pulp market , several new science fiction magazines were launched in pulp format during these years . Planet Stories , a pulp sf magazine that focused on interplanetary adventure , was sufficiently successful to switch to from quarterly to bimonthly in late 1950 . The publisher , Fiction House , also decided to launch a companion magazine , aimed more specifically at the growing readership for pocket books . This was Two Complete Science @-@ Adventure Books ; the first issue was dated Winter 1950 , and it appeared three times a year on a regular schedule . Malcolm Reiss , who oversaw several of Fiction House 's magazines and comics , was editorially involved with the Two Complete Science @-@ Adventure Stories throughout its life , but for the first three issues Jerome Bixby , who at that time was editing Planet Stories , took on the new magazine as well . Bixby left in 1951 to work for Standard Publications . After this , Reiss was left in sole control until 1953 , when Katherine Daffron was appointed editor . Daffron edited the magazine for the last two issues . Fiction House tried another companion magazine that year , Tops in Science Fiction , but it lasted for only two issues . Two Complete Science @-@ Adventures Books outlasted Tops in Science Fiction by only a few months ; it was cancelled in 1954 , amid the collapse of the overall pulp market . The final issue was dated Spring 1954 , and Planet Stories itself only lasted until the following year . 
 Two Complete Science @-@ Adventure Books typically carried about 80 @,@ 000 words , which was noticeably more than most of its competitors , which usually ran from 45 @,@ 000 to 75 @,@ 000 words . Fiction House paid $ 300 or more for the original novels it printed . 
 = = Contents = = 
 The magazine was originally intended to be a vehicle for reprinting novels . The title and format were an echo of Two Complete Detective Books Magazine , which had been published , also by Fiction House , in the 1930s . The first issue included Isaac Asimov 's Pebble in the Sky , and L. Ron Hubbard 's " The Kingslayer " . Both of these were reprints : Pebble in the Sky had been published by Doubleday earlier in the year , and " The Kingslayer " had appeared in Hubbard 's short story collection The Kingslayer , published by Fantasy Publishing Company , Inc . , in 1949 . Subsequent issues abandoned the policy of reprinting two novels , and for a while each issue featured one original story and one reprint . In some later issues both stories were original . 
 Although the authors included well @-@ known names such as James Blish and Poul Anderson , much of the material was , in the words of sf historian Joseph Marchesani , " derivative space opera " , particular the original novels . The original stories that appeared in the magazine included " The Wanton of Argus " , an early story by John Brunner ; " Seeker of the Sphinx " , by Arthur C. Clarke ; " Sword of <unk> " and " Sargasso of Lost Cities " , both by James Blish ; and " The <unk> Ring " , by L. Sprague de Camp . Reprints included The Time Machine by H.G. Wells ; Beyond This Horizon , by Robert A. Heinlein ( under the pseudonym Anson MacDonald ) ; and The <unk> by Jack Williamson . 
 Bixby included a column for readers ' letters in the issues he edited , but Reiss and Daffron did not , and none of the three wrote editorials . 
 The following table shows which novels appeared in which issues . 
 = = Bibliographic details = = 
 Two Complete Science @-@ Adventure Books was edited primarily by Jerome Bixby for the first three issues , then by Malcolm Reiss for six issues , and then primarily by Katherine Daffron for the last two issues . Reiss was involved with editing the magazine throughout its run . 
 The schedule was completely regular , with issues dated Spring , Summer , and Winter of each year . The magazine was in pulp format throughout ; each issue was priced at 25 cents . The first three issues were 144 pages ; this was reduced to 128 pages for the Winter 1951 issue , reduced again to 112 pages for the Spring 1952 issue , and reduced further to 96 pages for the next four issues . The last two issues were 128 pages long . The publisher was listed as Wings Publishing Co . , in New York for the first six issues and in Stamford , Connecticut , for the last five issues . 
 = Flying Aces ( magazine ) = 
 Flying Aces was a monthly American periodical of short stories about aviation , one of a number of so @-@ called " flying pulp " magazines popular during the 1920s and 1930s . Like other pulp magazines , it was a collection of adventure stories , originally printed on coarse , pulpy paper but later moved to a slick format . The magazine was launched in October 1928 by Periodical House , Inc . It featured stories written and illustrated by known authors of the day , often set against the background of World War I. Later issues added non @-@ fiction aviation articles , as well as articles and plans for model airplanes . The latter became more prominent , and eventually the magazine was renamed Flying Models , and catered exclusively to model airplane hobbyists . 
 = = Historical context = = 
 The period from the late 1920s through the 1930s is considered the heyday of pulp fiction , and pulps were at the peak of their popularity . Over 200 magazines were published monthly , reaching an audience of 10 million readers , with the most successful titles selling up to a million copies per issue . Pulp fiction publishers employed unprecedented levels of market segmentation for their titles , exploring every popular category , including love stories , western stories , detective stories , and mystery stories . Publications were highly specialized , with each category having its own set of magazines , readers , and reader expectations . 
 This period also coincided with the golden days of aviation , highlighted by feats such as Lindbergh 's solo flight across the Atlantic and the first extensive use of airplanes in combat in World War I. Pulp publishers sought to capitalize on public interest in flying , which was influenced by stories of World War I flying aces , particularly Eddie Rickenbacker ’ s memoirs , Fighting the Flying Circus , and Elliot Spring 's book on World War I combat flying , Nocturne Militaire . The revived interest in these stories was also due to films such as the 1927 release of Wings and Howard Hughes ' 1930 production of Hell 's Angels , an epic , mega @-@ budget movie featuring more than 100 pilots and dozens of planes , glorifying World War I American air aces . The movie led to numerous similar films , and a plethora of aviation @-@ oriented pulp magazines followed . Nicknamed " flying pulps , " more than forty pulps devoted to World War I air battles began publication during this time , including titles such as Aces ( 1928 ) , Battle Birds ( 1932 ) , Air Trails ( 1928 ) , G @-@ 8 and his Battle Aces ( 1933 ) , Sky Birds ( 1928 ) , War Aces ( 1930 ) , War Birds ( 1928 ) , Wings ( 1927 ) , and Flying Aces ( 1928 ) . 
 = = Content = = 
 The magazine ’ s genre was air adventure stories , some set against a war background , written by well @-@ known authors such as Lester Dent , Donald E. Keyhoe , Joe Archibald , and Arch Whitehouse . With the exception of Keyhoe and Whitehouse , who was with the RAF in World War I , the authors had no personal knowledge of flying . The plot invariably centered on a hero — a military pilot — trapped in a difficult situation , from which he would extricate himself utilizing exceptional flying skills . The stories never featured any love interest or profanity . Attempts to introduce such elements were soundly rejected by the readership . According to Whitehouse , he tried hard to introduce a " seductive secretary " character to the Kerry Keene series , but the effort was met with numerous letters from readers demanding that he " Get rid of the broad . Get her out of the series of Kerry Keene stories . "

The magazine ’ s tagline became " Fiction , Model Building , Fact — Three Aviation Magazines in One . " 
 During World War II the magazine had been subtitled " Magazine of the Flying Age " .

In later years , aviation modeling articles started appearing more regularly and became more and more dominant , until finally , in 1947 , the magazine was renamed Flying Models , and later sold to Carstens Publications in 1969 , without the fiction content . Flying Models ceased publication in 2014 .

 Many American pilots who took part in World War II grew up during the 1930s enthusiastically reading flying pulps such as Flying Aces , and were captivated by the adventure stories , an experience that no doubt played a part in their decision to become military aviators themselves .

 Royal Rumble ( 2007 ) was the twentieth annual Royal Rumble professional wrestling pay @-@ per @-@ view event produced by World Wrestling Entertainment ( WWE ) . It took place on January 28 , 2007 , at the AT & T Center in San Antonio , Texas and featured talent from the Raw , SmackDown ! and ECW brands . This marked the first time that the new ECW brand participated in the Royal Rumble match . As has been customary since 1993 , the Royal Rumble match winner received a match at that year 's WrestleMania , ( in this instance : WrestleMania 23 ) for his choice at either the WWE Championship , the World Heavyweight Championship or the ECW World Championship . 
 Five professional wrestling matches were featured on the event 's supercard , a scheduling of more than one main event . The main event was the annual 30 @-@ man Royal Rumble match , which featured wrestlers from all three brands . The Undertaker , the thirtieth entrant , won the match by last eliminating Shawn Michaels , the twenty @-@ third entrant . The primary match on the Raw brand was a Last Man Standing match for the WWE Championship between John Cena and Umaga . Cena won the match and retained the title after Umaga was unable to get to his feet before the referee counted to ten . The predominant match on the SmackDown ! brand was Batista versus Mr. Kennedy for the World Heavyweight Championship , which Batista won by pinfall after executing a Batista Bomb . The featured match on the ECW brand was between Bobby Lashley and Test for the ECW World Championship , which Lashley won after Test was counted out . 
 = = Background = = 
 Royal Rumble featured professional wrestling matches that involved different wrestlers from pre @-@ existing scripted feuds , plots , and storylines that were played out on Raw , SmackDown ! , and ECW – World Wrestling Entertainment 's ( WWE ) primary television programs . Wrestlers portrayed a villain or a hero as they followed a series of events that built tension , and culminated into a wrestling match or series of matches . The event featured wrestlers from WWE 's Raw , SmackDown , and ECW brands – a storyline division in which WWE employees were assigned to a television program of the same name . 
 The main feud heading into the Royal Rumble on the Raw brand was between John Cena and Umaga , with the two feuding over the WWE Championship . At the previous pay @-@ per @-@ view event , New Year 's Revolution , Cena defeated Umaga to end his undefeated streak and retain the WWE Championship . The night after on Raw , Armando Alejandro Estrada , Umaga 's manager , asked for a rematch , which Cena agreed to . Later that night , during a match between Cena and The Great Khali , Umaga interfered and attacked Cena . The following week , the official contract signing for their rematch at the Royal Rumble took place . After it was announced that Estrada could choose the match type , Estrada chose the match to be a Last Man Standing match . Cena signed the contract and proceeded to attack both Umaga and Estrada . On the January 22 episode of Raw , after Cena was eliminated from a Battle Royal , Umaga attacked Cena , and injured his spleen , which was portrayed as real as part of their storyline .

In the final match , between The Undertaker and The Miz , Kennedy interfered by pulling The Miz out of the ring . After performing the Tombstone piledriver on The Miz , The Undertaker went for the pin attempt . Time , however , ran out and Kennedy became the winner of the Sprint .

Lashley won , but was beaten down afterwards by Test . A title match between Lashley and Test was then made for the Royal Rumble . A week after that match was made , on the January 23 episode of ECW , Lashley defeated Test in another title match .

 The shows following the Royal Rumble surrounded The Undertaker 's choice of which champion to face at WrestleMania 23 . The Undertaker appeared on all three brands , and stared down the champions . Finally , on the February 5 episode of Raw , The Undertaker chose to face Batista for the World Heavyweight Championship , and performed a chokeslam on him , starting their rivalry . The Undertaker won the title at WrestleMania , and their feud continued until the May 11 episode of SmackDown ! , when The Undertaker lost the title to Edge , who cashed in the Money in the Bank , that he won from Mr. Kennedy , earlier that week on Raw . 
 After The Undertaker made his choice on February 5 , Shawn Michaels , Edge , and Randy Orton all wanted to face Cena for his title at WrestleMania . A Triple Threat match was made between the three for the title shot , which Michaels won after pinning Orton . Cena successfully retained his title against Michaels at WrestleMania . They continued to feud over the title with the addition of Orton and Edge , but Cena remained champion . Soon after the Royal Rumble , Umaga and Bobby Lashley joined the feud between Mr. McMahon and Donald Trump in the " Battle of the Billionaires " as their representatives respectively for the Hair vs. Hair match at WrestleMania . 
 His Royal Rumble match marked the start of Mr. Kennedy 's push to main @-@ event status . He went on to face Bobby Lashley for the ECW Championship at No Way Out , which he won via disqualification , thus failing to win the title . Kennedy won the Money in the Bank ladder match at WrestleMania , which gave him a world title shot at any time of his choosing for the year following . Kennedy sustained an injury at a house show , however , that would leave him sidelined for five to seven months , and was booked to lose his title shot to Edge on the May 7 episode of Raw . Later results showed the injury to be much less severe , but Kennedy had already lost his title shot . He returned to mid @-@ card status for the remainder of the year .

 = 2006 – 07 Toronto Raptors season = 
 The Toronto Raptors 2006 – 07 season is the twelfth National Basketball Association ( NBA ) season for the Toronto Raptors basketball franchise . Following a poor 2005 – 06 season , General Manager Bryan Colangelo greatly revamped the team roster during the pre @-@ season but continued to build the team around All @-@ Star Chris Bosh . Despite a sluggish start , the 2006 – 07 season transformed into a watershed year for Toronto . The Raptors captured their first division title , finished third in the Eastern Conference , made the playoffs for the first time in five years , equalled their best ever regular season record , and secured home court advantage for the first time in franchise history . However , the Raptors met the New Jersey Nets in the first round of the playoffs and were defeated four games to two . At the end of the regular season , head coach Sam Mitchell and Colangelo were named NBA Coach of the Year and NBA Executive of the Year respectively .

 Before the season , Toronto won the NBA Draft Lottery and were awarded the 1st overall pick in the 2006 NBA Draft . To prepare for their draft choice , the Raptors traded Rafael Araújo for Kris Humphries and Robert Whaley , and traded Matt Bonner , Eric Williams and a second round pick for Rasho Nesterovič and cash considerations . The 1st overall pick was used to select Italian Andrea Bargnani , making him the first European drafted number one overall . Maurizio Gherardini was hired as the club 's vice @-@ president and assistant general manager , making him the first European elevated to an NBA executive job . Promising small forward Charlie Villanueva was traded for point guard T. J. Ford and cash considerations , while Chris Bosh was rewarded with a three @-@ year extension .

 = = Regular season = = 
 General Manager Bryan Colangelo continued to surround Bosh with complementary players , and signed two @-@ time Euroleague Most Valuable Player Anthony Parker . Spanish international Jorge Garbajosa and former slam dunk champion Fred Jones were also signed from free agency . The Raptors concluded pre @-@ season transactions by re @-@ signing veteran Darrick Martin . With this new lineup , Toronto looked to maintain a team who could both pass and shoot the ball , but was also stronger defensively than the 2005 – 06 roster . As a showcase of their new roster , on 15 October 2006 , the 119 points by Toronto marked the third highest total in a pre @-@ season game in franchise history . The Raptors finished the pre @-@ season with a 7 – 1 win @-@ loss record , which was the best record in the league and a franchise record . 
 = = = Push for playoffs = = = 
 The first half of the season produced mixed results as Toronto struggled towards the .500 mark after a dismal 2 – 8 start . Bosh 's consistent performances however ensured he was named an All @-@ Star starter in the 2007 NBA All @-@ Star Game on 25 January 2007 . He received the most number of votes after LeBron James among all Eastern Conference forwards . A day later , the Raptors hit the .500 mark for the first time since the 2003 – 04 season after defeating the Boston Celtics at the Air Canada Centre . On 2 February , the Raptors went 24 – 23 , the first time since 2001 – 02 that they had been over .500 this late in a season . As a result , the Raptors won three NBA Eastern Conference awards for the month of January : Player of the Month ( Bosh ) , Rookie of the Month ( Bargnani ) and Coach of the Month ( Sam Mitchell ) . On 4 February , the Raptors ' 122 – 110 home win against the Los Angeles Clippers represented a season @-@ high in points for the Raptors . Within the same week , Bosh 's career @-@ high 41 points in a win against the Orlando Magic prompted an unheard of event at the Air Canada Centre — chants of " MVP " by the home fans . This chant was repeated in a win against Vince Carter 's New Jersey Nets ten days later — to the disbelief of Carter — a game which also saw the team break franchise records for most number of home wins and highest home winning percentage entering the All @-@ Star break . 
 After the break , Colangelo traded Jones for Juan Dixon , a versatile guard . Luke Jackson was also signed to provide depth to Toronto 's bench . Following a win against the Charlotte Bobcats on 1 April 2007 , Toronto clinched a playoff berth for the first time in five years . They then claimed their first division title when they defeated the Philadelphia 76ers five days later , winning the Atlantic Division crown . Another franchise record was set when Toronto won the next game against the Bulls , this time for most home wins . 
 The Raptors were eventually seeded third in the Eastern Conference , marking one of the biggest turnarounds in NBA history in terms of league standing and defensive ranking . Throughout the season , they were lauded for playing solid defense and good sharing and moving of the ball . José Calderón , Bargnani , Dixon and Morris Peterson turned in reliable performances from the bench while Ford and Bosh ran the offence with consistent numbers . And in Parker and Garbajosa , the Raptors had two very versatile players who could both defend and attack . Furthermore , in contrast to previous seasons , the Raptors were able to win games despite injuries to key players such as Bosh , Bargnani , Parker , Ford and Garbajosa . Colangelo , Gherardini and Mitchell were also largely credited for transforming Toronto 's fortunes . 
 = = = Standings = = = 
 = = Playoffs = = 
 As third seed , the Raptors played sixth seed New Jersey Nets in the first round of the 2007 NBA Playoffs . The series drew much media attention as Vince Carter , a former Raptor who left Toronto under acrimonious circumstances two seasons ago , was now back at the ACC as a Net . In the opening game , while Carter was constantly booed by the home crowd and was not an offensive threat , Toronto 's inexperience was evident as they too struggled offensively and were down 65 – 78 going into the fourth quarter . A late rally by Toronto in the fourth quarter was not enough as they eventually lost 91 – 96 . The Raptors won game 2 89 – 83 at the ACC to tie the series 1 – 1 , as Bosh recorded 25 points and a game @-@ high 13 rebounds . The Nets won games 3 and 4 to lead 3 – 1 , but Toronto forced a game 6 when they narrowly won 98 – 96 in game 5 . In that game , the Raptors set two post @-@ season franchise records : most number of points going into halftime and biggest lead for a half . The attendance for the game was also a franchise record for a playoff game . In game 6 , however , New Jersey won 98 – 97 , sealing the series 4 – 2 and sending Toronto out of the first round . 
 In recognition of being the chief architects of Toronto 's turnaround season , on 24 April 2007 , Mitchell was named 2006 – 07 NBA Coach of the Year , the first Raptors coach to receive this honour ; Colangelo was later named 2006 – 07 Executive of the Year .

 = North Philadelphia station = 
 North Philadelphia station is an intercity rail and regional rail station on the Northeast Corridor , located on North Broad Street in the North Philadelphia neighborhood of Philadelphia , Pennsylvania , United States . The Southeastern Pennsylvania Transportation Authority 's ( SEPTA ) Regional Rail Trenton Line and Chestnut Hill West Line account for most of the station 's service ; five Amtrak trains also stop each weekday . 
 The station opened in the 1870s and was known as New York Junction and Germantown Junction . A new station , which ushered in the Beaux @-@ Arts style for large train stations , was built from 1896 to 1901 . After a 1912 – 1915 enlargement , it was renamed as North Philadelphia . Despite several other renovations , its use declined in the mid and late 20th century ; in 1991 , Amtrak constructed a smaller replacement station across the tracks . The building was renovated once more in 1999 and is now used as commercial space . It was added to the National Register of Historic Places the same year . 
 = = Layout and service = = 
 Two high @-@ level island platforms serve three of the four Northeast Corridor passenger tracks ; there is a center passing track , as well as a fifth track on the south side that is only used by CSX freights . Most SEPTA Trenton Line trains and five daily Amtrak trains ( two northbound and three southbound ) stop at these platforms . Two low @-@ level platforms , a short distance to the west , serve the diverging SEPTA @-@ owned Chestnut Hill West Line . North Philadelphia has been a flag stop on the line since 1993 . The station has relatively low inbound boardings ; however , it is used by riders from the Chestnut Hill West Line transferring to SEPTA and Amtrak trains to reach jobs in New Jersey and New York . 
 The station is within a few blocks of the North Broad station on SEPTA 's Main Line ( formerly belonging to the Reading Company ) , and the North Philadelphia subway station on SEPTA 's Broad Street Line .

 = = = Germantown Junction = = = 
 The Pennsylvania Railroad ( PRR ) built the Connecting Railway in 1867 to connect its main line to the Philadelphia and Trenton Railroad . By the early 1870s , New York Junction station was established where the Connecting Railway crossed over the Philadelphia and Reading Railroad mainline in North Philadelphia . A signal tower , still extant , was constructed around this time . 
 By the early 1880s , the PRR station was known as Germantown Junction , while the Reading had its 16th Street station a block to the northwest ( and after 1890 , Huntingdon Street station to the southeast ) . Germantown Junction station was a two @-@ story Queen Anne style building located between the diverging lines ; its large gables acted as shelters for passengers . 
 = = = A new station needed = = = 
 By the mid 1890s , the station was frequently overcrowded and North Philadelphia and the northern suburbs grew in population . The completion of the Delair Bridge in 1896 allowed passengers to ride trains directly to the summer resorts of southern New Jersey ( rather than taking a ferry to Camden ) further increased traffic on the line . George B. Roberts , president of the railroad , used his social connections to hire Theophilus Parsons Chandler , Jr. to construct a new station . The new station was constructed on a former freight yard on the south side of the tracks ( across from the previous station ) , where there was more space for the station . The site also provided better connections for passengers using newly electrified streetcars on Glenwood Avenue and North Broad Street to reach the station . 
 Foundation construction began in May 1896 . However , work was stopped when Roberts took ill in August ; he died the next January . The Panic of 1896 led Roberts ' successor , Frank Thomson , not to continue work . When Thomson died in 1899 , Alexander Cassatt was recalled to the PRR to serve as president . Cassatt immediately began a major capital improvement program , which included both adding capacity to mainlines and constructing large stations including Washington Union Station and New York Penn Station . Work resumed in 1900 with an enlarged floor plan , and the new station was complete in April 1901 . 
 = = = Architecture = = = 
 Previous PRR stations were generally in the picturesque eclectic style common among 19th century railroads stations , like the Victorian eclectic Overbrook station and the Furness @-@ style Broad Street Station . Germantown Junction was the first station along the Northeast Corridor to be constructed in the Châteauesque style , and it ushered in the Beaux Arts style used by the Pennsylvania and other railroads during the early 20th century . 
 As constructed , the main facade of the station faced Glenwood Avenue . The two @-@ story entrance loggia consisted of seven arched bays , with a three @-@ bay wing to the northeast and a two @-@ bay wing to the southwest , and acted as a transition point between the street and the station interior . The first floor ( at track level ) featured a large waiting room occupying the entire center block , with vault lights providing natural illumination and a fountain set into the western wall . Restrooms , a kitchen , and a cafe occupied the wings . 
 The basement housed the boiler room , a smaller waiting room , kitchen storerooms , and baggage rooms . The station appears to have had two side platforms serving four tracks , accessed through a basement @-@ level tunnel that was reached from the main waiting room by a staircase . The steep roof over the center block had several dormers , some of which were later removed . A covered ramp from the west wing , which had direct access from the south platform , led to a small trolley station on Glenwood Avenue . 
 = = = North Philadelphia = = = 
 After construction , the station served as Philadelphia 's sole stop for most long @-@ distance east @-@ west Main Line traffic to avoid a reverse move into Broad Street Station ( and later 30th Street Station ) . It also served local trains from Fort Washington , Chestnut Hill , Bustleton , and Trenton , as well as a variety of services from the PRR @-@ owned West Jersey and Seashore Railroad system . Within a decade of completion , the station was already overcrowded . On June 22 , 1912 , the PRR signed a million @-@ dollar contract for massive renovations to the station . Designed by PRR architect William H. Cookman , the modifications reflected the latest in passenger station design . 
 The ground was lowered by a full story on the south and east sides of the station , exposing what had formerly been the basement to improve access for taxis and private automobiles . A marquee to shelter arriving and departing passengers spanned the seven central bays of the lower level , with a more ornate version on the north end of the pedestrian tunnel . The lower waiting room was expanded , a ticket office constructed , and a larger staircase to the main waiting room was built . The floor was covered with terrazzo and green marble , with white marble wainscoting on the walls . Three bays were added to the west wing for additional functional space , removing direct track access from the ramp . Cast iron streetlights with the PRR Keystone motif in their base were located around the driveway and grounds . 
 The original side platforms were replaced with high @-@ level island platforms , long enough to permit level boarding for twelve @-@ car trains . The platforms and platform supports were constructed of cast @-@ in @-@ place concrete . The line was widened to eight tracks through the station , with the platforms between the 2nd and 3rd tracks and the 6th and 7th tracks . The center non @-@ platform tracks were reserved for through freights , with the outside non @-@ platform tracks used by local freights . Each platform had a 10 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) -wide waiting room , 60 feet ( 18 m ) long on the eastbound ( south ) platform and 80 feet ( 24 m ) long on the westbound platform . The waiting rooms were covered in copper sheathing and had large skylights . The railroad constructed full @-@ length steel platform canopies in their own shops . A separate baggage tunnel , west of the main passenger tunnel , connected with freight elevators to the platforms . When the renovations were complete in 1915 , the station was renamed as North Philadelphia . 
 = = = Decline = = = 
 North Philadelphia continued to grow during the early 20th century as a popular residential area for the nouveau riche rejected by old money society . Two ballparks ( Baker Bowl and Shibe Park ) were located nearby , as were new cultural institutions and automotive industry buildings . In 1928 , the Broad Street Subway was opened with a station at North Philadelphia , offering more frequent service to downtown . Its northern entrances were located at the intersection of Glenwood Avenue and North Broad Street , with an underground passage offering an easy connection to the PRR station . The Reading Company replaced Huntingdon Avenue station with North Broad Street station , a massive Classical Revival structure rivaling the PRR station in grandeur . 30th Street Station opened in 1933 , reducing North Philadelphia 's importance for north @-@ south services . However , North Philadelphia continued to serve heavy commuter traffic and east @-@ west long @-@ distance trains . 
 An interior rearrangement was completed around 1942 . The women 's room for the main waiting room was moved from the east side to the west side , with one bay added to the west wing . A new dining area was constructed , occupying one @-@ third of the waiting room , with its kitchen occupying the former bathroom space . The lunch cafe and staircases were also modified . 
 After World War II , North Philadelphia suffered from the failure of its industries , and the PRR reduced both local and long @-@ distance service due to competition from private autos , further reducing the importance of the station . Escalators and a new drop ceiling were added around 1955 , the former due to the insistence of the city council . The surrounding parking lots and ground were rearranged in 1968 . 
 After a March 1976 fire , 1977 Amtrak undertook a $ 314 @,@ 000 rehabilitation of the station . The roof and portico were rebuilt , two of the three dormers removed , new restrooms added , and the platform and waiting room repaired . The loggia , windows , and other openings were covered with <unk> and brick . 
 = = = New station and reuse = = = 
 In the 1980s , the city and Amtrak attempted to fund a second renovation with a private partner , but plans fell through . In 1991 , Amtrak constructed a rectangular concrete and glass station building on the north side of the tracks , in front of the passenger tunnel . Access from the south was blocked off . In 1999 , the original station building was renovated at a cost of $ 7 million for use as commercial space . The front parking lot was expanded on a slope to the west ; it covered much of the ground level ( similar to the station before 1915 ) . The mechanical building and the covered ramp to the trolley station were removed . A strip mall was built just to the east , with balustrades and archways referencing the historic station . The passageway from the subway station , long closed , was likely buried at this time . The 1901 @-@ built station building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places on July 8 , 1999 . 
 The Amtrak ticket office was closed in April 2001 as part of austerity measures . Vandalism also forced the closure of elevators . The same year , SEPTA proposed closing the station because it served few inbound commuters . However , advocacy from the Delaware Valley Association of Rail Passengers , which showed that the station was more heavily used by commuters from the Chestnut Hill West Line changing to SEPTA Trenton Line trains and Amtrak <unk> to Trenton and New York , succeeded in persuading SEPTA to keep the station open for the time being . By 2005 , no official decision had been made to permanently keep the station , but SEPTA planned repairs to the deteriorated platforms . 
 In 2010 , a renovation of North Philadelphia subway station was completed . This included restoring the Glenwood Avenue <unk> , closed for decades before , which improved connections to the mainline station .

 Superman Returns is a 2006 American superhero film directed and produced by Bryan Singer . It is based on the DC Comics character Superman and serves as a homage sequel to the motion pictures Superman ( 1978 ) and Superman II ( 1980 ) , ignoring the events of Superman III ( 1983 ) and Superman IV : The Quest for Peace ( 1987 ) . The film stars Brandon Routh as Clark Kent / Superman , Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane , Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor , with James Marsden , Frank Langella , and Parker Posey . The film tells the story of the title character returning to Earth after a five @-@ year absence . He finds that his love interest Lois Lane has moved on with her life , and that his archenemy Lex Luthor is plotting a scheme that will destroy Superman and the world . 
 After a series of unsuccessful projects to resurrect Superman on the screen , Warner Bros. hired Bryan Singer to direct and develop Superman Returns in July 2004 . The majority of principal photography took place at Fox Studios Australia , Sydney , while the visual effects sequences were created by a number of studios , including Sony Pictures Imageworks , Rhythm & Hues , Framestore , Rising Sun Pictures , and The Orphanage ; filming ended in November 2005 . 
 Superman Returns received positive reviews , with critics praising its story , visual effects , musical score , and style . However , it received mixed reviews from audiences , who criticized the film for its length , the story , and lack of action sequences . Warner Bros. was also disappointed with the worldwide box office return . A sequel was planned for a summer 2009 release , but the project was later canceled . The Superman film series was rebooted in 2013 with the film Man of Steel , directed by Zack Snyder and starring Henry Cavill as Superman . 
 = = Plot = = 
 For five years , Superman ( Brandon Routh ) has abandoned his adopted home of Earth while on a journey to visit the remains of Krypton . His seemingly selfish decision has ruined his image in the eyes of many , including journalist Lois Lane ( Kate Bosworth ) , who writes a scathing article claiming that the world " doesn 't need Superman " . Scientist Lex Luthor ( Kevin Spacey ) , who lost his fame and fortune after being exposed as a criminal by Superman , secures an early release from prison and marries an old heiress , whose subsequent death makes him wealthy once again . Upon returning to Metropolis , Superman , in his human identity of Clark Kent , is shocked to discover the consequences of his disappearance . While covering the launch of a space shuttle , he narrowly saves a plane carrying Lois and other observers from crashing after a mysterious power failure , an act that earns him much goodwill . Unbeknownst to anyone , the accident was triggered by Luthor using Kryptonian technology stolen from the Fortress of Solitude . 
 Clark tries to fix his relationship with Lois , but soon learns that she is engaged to Richard White ( James Marsden ) , nephew of Daily Planet editor @-@ in @-@ chief Perry White ( Frank Langella ) , with whom she shares a young , asthmatic son , Jason ( Tristan Lake Leabu ) . Luthor has his aide Kitty ( Parker Posey ) distract Superman , allowing Lex to steal a sample of kryptonite from a museum . Suspecting his involvement , Lois requests an off @-@ the @-@ record interview aboard his private yacht . Luthor admits that he is indeed responsible and reveals his true plan : to create a new continent modeled after Krypton that he can shape in his image , while triggering massive tsunamis that will wipe out the nations of the world and force humanity to turn to him for survival . Jason has an asthmatic attack when Luthor reveals the kryptonite , but has no subsequent reaction when Luthor holds the stone near him . 
 Jason is sitting by the piano and the Yacht starts to rock from the waves . When one of Luthor 's henchmen threatens Lois , Jason pushes the piano towards the henchmen showing Lois that Jason is Superman 's son . Luthor and his thugs escape by helicopter as the new landmass emerges from the ocean . While working to contain the damage to Metropolis , Superman learns from Richard that Lois is in danger and saves her and Jason seconds before the yacht sinks . 
 Superman tries to apprehend Luthor , but the kryptonite @-@ poisoned atmosphere quickly strips him of his powers . After letting his men beat him into submission , Luthor stabs Superman with a Kryptonite shard and leaves him to die . With Richard 's help , Lois gets him to safety and removes the shard . Fueled by the sun 's radiation , Superman defeats Luthor 's gang and covers the landmass with soil , allowing him to safely throw it into space . While helping Luthor escape , a disillusioned Kitty allows the helicopter to crash on a remote island , trapping him . Complications from Kryptonite exposure cause Superman to fall into a coma , and while doctors are able to remove most of the fragments , they cannot revive him . Lois visits him and whispers something into his ear while glancing at Jason , after which Superman comes to . Acknowledging that he has a much greater responsibility than himself , he recalls Jor @-@ El 's ( Marlon Brando ) last speech to Jason as he sleeps .

 Brandon Routh as Clark Kent / Superman : The Kryptonian superhero who disguises himself as a journalist . Stephan Bender portrays the teenage Clark Kent in a flashback scene . Director Singer believed only an unknown actor would be suitable for the part . Routh was chosen from thousands of candidates interviewed at casting calls in the United States , United Kingdom , Canada and Australia . He had coincidentally auditioned for Clark Kent in the television series Smallville , but lost to Tom Welling . Routh had also met director Joseph " McG " Nichol for the role during pre @-@ production of Superman : Flyby . Dana Reeve , wife of Christopher Reeve , believed Routh 's physical resemblance to her late husband was striking . To obtain the muscular physique to play Superman convincingly , Routh underwent a strict bodybuilding exercise regimen . Prior to Routh 's casting , Singer had X2 actor Daniel Cudmore audition . 
 Kate Bosworth as Lois Lane : A reporter who works with Clark Kent at the Daily Planet , and former lover of Superman . Spacey recommended Singer to cast Bosworth in the role because she co @-@ starred with Spacey in Beyond the Sea ( 2004 ) as Sandra Dee . Claire Danes and Keri Russell were reportedly considered for the role . Amy Adams , who would later be cast as Lois Lane in the 2013 reboot Man of Steel , confirmed in an interview that she had also auditioned for Lois in 2005 . Adams had previously auditioned for Lois in 2003 when Brett Ratner was planning to direct Superman : Flyby . Bosworth studied Katharine Hepburn 's acting for inspiration , particularly in The Philadelphia Story ( 1940 ) and Guess Who 's Coming to Dinner ( 1967 ) , as well as Julia Roberts in Erin Brockovich ( 2000 ) . 
 Kevin Spacey as Lex Luthor : An evil sociopath armed with vast resources and an extensive knowledge of science who is Superman 's nemesis . Because of his Academy Award @-@ winning performance in Singer 's film The Usual Suspects ( 1995 ) , and friendship with the director , Spacey was the only actor considered for Lex Luthor . The writers specifically had Spacey in mind for the part when writing the script . Spacey 's version of Luthor has the same comically exaggerated vanity and pompous arrogance of the earlier Gene Hackman version as well as the same strong interest in real estate , but Spacey 's version is far less campy and more serious . Spacey later said that director Singer told him to play the character as " darker and more bitter " compared to Hackman and not to use the earlier portrayal as an inspiration . 
 James Marsden as Richard White : The nephew of the Daily Planet editor @-@ in @-@ chief Perry White and fiancé to Lois Lane . Marsden said Richard acts as an emotional challenge for Superman , since the hero comes back to find that " Lois Lane picks somebody who 's very <unk> " . 
 Parker Posey as Kitty Kowalski : Lex Luthor 's henchwoman . She served as a prison nurse and would give Lex his examinations . The character is based on Eve Teschmacher from the 1978 film , portrayed by Valerie Perrine . Posey was the only actress considered for the role . 
 Marlon Brando as Jor @-@ El : Superman 's biological father . Brando ( who died in 2004 ) reprises his role from the 1978 film through the use of previous footage combined with computer @-@ generated imagery . This required negotiations with Brando 's estate for permission to have his footage used . Singer explained , " We had access to all of the Brando footage that was shot . There was unused footage that had Brando reciting poems , trailing off subject and swearing like a sailor . " 
 Tristan Lake Leabu as Jason White : The son of Lois Lane and Superman . The question of whether Superman or Richard is Jason 's father is initially unclear . He suffers from asthma and other ailments , but it is later revealed that he is the son of Superman , when he displays superhuman strength and discomfort around Kryptonite . 
 Other cast members include Frank Langella , who plays Daily Planet editor Perry White , a role originally attached to Hugh Laurie ; Sam Huntington as Daily Planet photographer Jimmy Olsen , Eva Marie Saint as Clark Kent 's adoptive mother Martha Kent , and Kal Penn as one of Luthor 's henchmen , Stanford . Jack Larson , who portrayed Jimmy Olsen in the 1950s television series Adventures of Superman , makes a cameo appearance as a bartender . Noel Neill — who portrayed Lois Lane in the television series and the film serials Superman ( 1948 ) and Atom Man vs. Superman ( 1950 ) -- appears as Luthor 's elderly wife Gertrude <unk> . Richard Branson cameos as the engineer aboard the space shuttle . Another of Luthor 's henchmen ( Riley ) is played by former Australian Rugby League player Ian Roberts .

 Director and producer Bryan Singer conceived the storyline of " Superman returning to Earth after a five @-@ year absence " during the filming of X2 ( 2003 ) . He presented the idea to Lauren Shuler Donner and her husband Richard Donner , director of Superman ( 1978 ) . Donner greeted Singer 's idea with positive feedback . In March 2004 , Warner Bros. was commencing pre @-@ production on Superman : Flyby , which had a target theatrical release date of June 2006 . McG was signed to direct with a script by J. J. Abrams , but dropped out in June 2004 . That same month , Singer was approached by Warner Bros. to pitch his idea for Superman Returns , as he was preparing to leave for Hawaii on a short vacation with his X2 writers Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris . While in Hawaii , Singer , Dougherty and Harris began to outline the film treatment . In July 2004 , Singer signed on to direct and develop Superman Returns . 
 Although he was not a comic book fan , Singer was most impressed with Donner 's 1978 film , citing it as an influence of his , Dougherty and Harris 's writing . With Singer 's hiring , he dropped out of X @-@ Men : The Last Stand ( 2006 ) and also had the Logan 's Run remake pushed back . Superman Returns was financed 50 / 50 between Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures , and pre @-@ production began in November 2004 . By February 2005 , Dougherty and Harris had written six drafts of the script . Early versions of the script contained references to the September 11 attacks before they were removed .

 Warner Bros. considered shooting Superman Returns at Warner Roadshow Studios in the Gold Coast , Queensland , Australia . After filming , this could have been used as an attraction for the adjoining Warner Bros. Movie World theme park , but the idea was scrapped for being too expensive . Set construction started in January 2005 at Fox Studios Australia for the film 's 60 setpieces , while the start date was pushed back for two weeks . In an attempt to avoid public attention , Superman Returns carried the fake working title of Red Sun during filming . Starting in late March 2005 , principal photography lasted until November . Filming of Superman Returns in New South Wales constituted hiring thousands of local workers , generating over $ 100 million into the local economy . 80 % of filming took place at Fox Studios Australia , occupying all nine sound stages . Scenes set in Smallville were shot at Tamworth , while the Australian Museum doubled for the Metropolis Museum of Natural History .

 Superman Returns was shot using Panavision 's Genesis digital camera . Production designer Guy Hendrix Dyas was influenced by Frank Lloyd Wright 's Johnson Wax Headquarters for the design of the Daily Planet . ESC Entertainment was originally set to design the visual effects sequences , but Warner Bros. replaced them with the hiring of Mark Stetson from Sony Pictures Imageworks as the visual effects supervisor . A total of 1 @,@ 400 visual effects shots were created . The script required a scene of Superman safely delivering a Boeing 777 in a baseball park where computer @-@ generated imagery was used as it would have been impossible to assemble the number of extras for the shots . A second unit crew traveled to Dodger Stadium to photograph elements that were composited into the final images . The scenes of Metropolis was actually a modified version of the skyline of Manhattan . Using footage from the original Superman ( 1978 ) film as a reference point , Marlon Brando was re @-@ created by Rhythm & Hues using CGI . The opening credits for Superman Returns are presented in an intended recreation of the style used for Superman , again to the accompaniment of John Williams 's theme music .

 Singer hired regular collaborator John Ottman as editor and film score composer months before the script was written . Ottman said in past interviews that John Williams , who composed the 1978 film , had influenced his decision to become a musician . He was both cautious and enthusiastic to work on Superman Returns . " Bryan [ Singer ] said he wouldn 't even greenlight the movie if he couldn 't use the John Williams music . " Ottman continued , " it was important for me to preserve the Williams theme right down to every single note for the opening titles . " Ottman referred to his work on Superman Returns as a homage to , not a ripoff of , Williams .

 Superman Returns received mixed to positive reviews from film critics . Based on 258 reviews collected by Rotten Tomatoes , 76 % of the reviewers enjoyed the film . Metacritic gave the film a score of 72 / 100 , based on 40 reviews , indicating " generally favorable reviews . " Richard Corliss of Time praised Superman Returns , calling it one of the best superhero films . He was mostly impressed with Singer 's direction and the storyline . Joe Morgenstern from The Wall Street Journal also gave a positive review , but observed Routh 's and Bosworth 's acting was " somewhat dead or super average . Nothing special . " Morgenstern believed Lex Luthor 's characterization was " well written by the writers and well played by Kevin Spacey " . He also praised Newton Thomas Sigel 's cinematography and Guy Hendrix Dyas 's production design . 
 Peter Travers , writing in Rolling Stone , felt the film " perfectly updates Superman for the modern audience " . J. Hoberman of The Village Voice called it " surprisingly well made . It 's a summer blockbuster filled with mythology and sensitivity . " James Berardinelli reacted positively to the movie , comparing it favorably with Richard Donner 's 1978 film . He felt Spacey was better than Gene Hackman as Lex Luthor , describing him as " more cruel and less flippant " than Hackman . " There are no <unk> to be found in the supporting cast , either , " Berardinelli said . " Superman Returns is near the top , if not at the top of the superhero movie pile . It offers nearly everything : romance , action , humor , and plenty of goose bumps . " 
 However , Roger Ebert argued the film was a " glum , lackluster movie in which even the big effects sequences seem dutiful instead of exhilarating . " He also felt that " Brandon Routh lacks charisma as Superman " , surmising that he " may have been cast because he looks a little like Reeve " . Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle felt that Warner Bros. should have rebooted the series along the lines of Batman Begins . He also felt Bosworth , at 22 years old , was too young to portray Lois Lane , and the climax did not " match the potential of the tiring 154 minute long film " . 
 Superman Returns was nominated for both the Academy Award for Visual Effects and BAFTA Award for Best Special Visual Effects , but lost to Pirates of the Caribbean : Dead Man 's Chest . The film was successful at the 33rd Saturn Awards , winning Best Fantasy Film , and categories for Direction ( Bryan Singer ) , Best Actor ( Brandon Routh ) , Writing ( Michael Dougherty and Dan Harris ) and Music ( John Ottman ) . Kate Bosworth , Tristan Lake Leabu , James Marsden , Parker Posey , and the visual effects department were nominated for categories . However , Bosworth was also nominated a Razzie Award for Worst Supporting Actress . 
 On May 3 , 2009 , almost three years after the debut of Superman Returns , the Academy Award winning filmmaker and screenwriter Quentin Tarantino declared his appreciation for Bryan Singer 's directorial work on Superman Returns and that he would write a 20 @-@ page review about Superman Returns . 
 On January 9 , 2012 , more than five years after the movie was released , the independent film community daily news site indieWire released a two @-@ part video essay that probes the melancholic nature of Superman Returns . Produced by Matt Zoller Seitz and Ken <unk> , the critique was inspired by a review that Seitz wrote for the New York Press in 2006 , in which he stated that " From the moment its hero returns to the sky to rescue Lois Lane from a plummeting jet , Superman Returns flirts with greatness . " 
 A critical commentary of the film written in English around the time of its release by a Pakistani columnist , Dr Haider Mahdi , accused the film of being " American propaganda " and portraying opponents to the United States as evil , while defending American foreign policy . It claims previous adaptations of Superman advocate American aggression and coincided the films release with America 's war in the Middle East and South Asia . It alleges that American society has always needed an " external threat " to justify invasions and aggression and the portrayal of Superman in film glorifies him when he eliminates these " external threats " . 
 In 2013 , Singer stated that Superman Returns was made for " Perhaps more of a female audience . It wasn 't what it needed to be , I guess . " Singer stated that he would have cut about the first quarter off of the film and started it with " the jet disaster sequence or something . I could have grabbed the audience a little more quickly . I don 't know what would have helped . Probably nothing . If I could go again , I would do an origin . I would reboot it . " 
 Empire Magazine ranked the movie 496 on its " The 500 Greatest Movies of All Time " list . Stating that " It may have been a slighter return than some people had hoped for , but Singer 's vision of the Man Of Steel is an heroic effort . Plenty of spectacle and a lot of heart helps Kal @-@ El soar . "

 In February 2006 , four months before the release of Superman Returns , Warner Bros. announced a mid @-@ 2009 theatrical release date for a sequel , with Bryan Singer reprising his directing duties . Brandon Routh , Kate Bosworth , Kevin Spacey , Sam Huntington , Frank Langella , and Tristan Lake Leabu were to reprise their roles . Due to his commitment , Singer dropped out of directing a remake of Logan 's Run and an adaptation of The Mayor of Castro Street . Writer Michael Dougherty wanted the sequel to be " action packed " , featuring " other Kryptonians " with Brainiac and Bizarro also considered for primary villains . The " New Krypton " landmass floating in space at the end of Superman Returns would have served as a plot device . Although Superman Returns received mostly positive reviews , Warner Bros. and Legendary Pictures were disappointed by the film 's box office return . Warner Bros. President Alan F. Horn explained that Superman Returns was a very successful film , but that it " should have done $ 500 million worldwide . We should have had perhaps a little more action to satisfy the young male crowd . " Singer reacted incredulously to the studio complaints , saying , " That movie made $ 400 million ! I don ’ t know what constitutes under @-@ performing these days ... " $ 175 million was the maximum budget Warner Bros. was projecting for the sequel , as Superman Returns cost $ 204 million . 
 Filming for the Superman Returns sequel was to start in mid @-@ 2007 , before Singer halted development in favor of Valkyrie . Filming was then pushed to March 2008 , but writers Dougherty and Dan Harris left in favor of other career opportunities . The 2007 – 2008 Writers Guild of America strike pushed the release date to 2010 . Singer still listed the sequel as a priority in March 2008 , saying that the film was in early development . Routh expected filming to begin in early 2009 . Paul Levitz , president of DC Comics , expected Routh to reprise the title role from Superman Returns before his contract for a sequel expired in 2009 . However , with Warner Bros. deciding to reboot the film series , Singer dropped out in favor of directing Jack the Giant Slayer . In August 2008 , Warner Bros. President of Production Jeff Robinov reflected , " Superman Returns didn 't quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to . It didn 't position the character the way he needed to be positioned . Had Superman worked in 2006 , we would have had a movie for Christmas of this year or 2009 . Now the plan is just to reintroduce Superman without regard to a Batman and Superman movie at all . " 
 = Sam Loxton = 
 Samuel John Everett " Sam " Loxton , OBE ( 29 March 1921 – 3 December 2011 ) was an Australian cricketer , footballer and politician . Among these three pursuits , his greatest achievements were attained on the cricket field ; he played in 12 Tests for Australia from 1948 to 1951 . A right @-@ handed all @-@ rounder , Loxton was part of Don Bradman 's Invincibles , who went through the 1948 tour of England undefeated , an unprecedented achievement that has never been matched . As well as being a hard @-@ hitting middle @-@ order batsman , Loxton was a right @-@ arm fast @-@ medium swing bowler who liked to aim at the upper bodies of the opposition , and an outfielder with an accurate and powerful throw . After being dropped from the national team , Loxton represented Victoria for seven more seasons before retiring from first @-@ class cricket . He served as an administrator after his playing days were over and spent 24 years as a Liberal Party member of the Victorian Legislative Assembly . Up until 1946 , Loxton also played in the Victorian Football League ( VFL ) for St Kilda as a forward . In all three arenas , he was known for his energetic approach . 
 Educated at Wesley College , Melbourne , Loxton first gained prominence as an Australian rules football player . After debuting in 1942 , he played 41 games in the VFL for St Kilda as a forward , kicking a total of 114 goals before retiring at the end of the 1946 season to concentrate on his cricket career . In 1944 , he headed St Kilda 's goal @-@ kicking aggregate with 52 goals and placed second in the club 's Best and Fairest . Loxton served in a tank division during World War II and made his first @-@ class cricket debut in 1946 – 47 . He scored 232 not out , which remains a record for any Australian player on his first @-@ class debut . After a strong first season , Loxton was selected to make his Test debut in the final match of the 1947 – 48 home series against India . Australia had already won the series and used the last match to trial their young talent . Loxton seized his opportunity , scoring 80 and taking three wickets , securing himself a position on the 1948 England tour . 
 After a slow start to the historic campaign , Loxton struck form midway through the English summer and forced his way into the team for the last three Tests . He played a prominent role in the Fourth Test , scoring an aggressive and counterattacking 93 that helped Australia pry the initiative from England ; the tourists eventually won the match . In 1949 – 50 , Loxton cemented his position in the national team , playing in all five Tests in South Africa and scoring his only century at international level . He remained a regular member of the Test team until a form slump during the 1950 – 51 home season ; he was dropped after three Tests against England and never played for Australia again . Loxton continued to play for Victoria in domestic competition until retiring at the end of the 1957 – 58 season . 
 A member of the Liberal Party , Loxton entered politics and was a member of Victorian Legislative Assembly , representing the electoral district of Prahran from 1955 to 1979 . During this time , Loxton was also active in cricket administration at club , state and international level . He was a state selector for over two decades , and served at national level for ten years , starting in 1970 – 71 . He was also the team manager for Australia 's tour of the subcontinent in 1959 – 60 , overseeing a successful campaign despite a spate of serious illnesses to personnel . Loxton had to deal with a variety of tumultuous events on and off the field during his tenure , often relating to player misconduct , and retired from cricket administration in 1981 following the underarm incident . 
 = = Early and war years = = 
 Loxton was born in March 1921 at Albert Park , Victoria , the son of Sam Sr. and Annie . The elder Sam Loxton was an electrician who played second grade cricket for Collingwood . The younger Sam started his education at Yarra Park State School , where he learned to bat , using a pine tree in the schoolyard as the stumps ; the same tree was used for the same purpose years earlier by Test players Vernon Ransford and Ernie McCormick , and long @-@ serving Victorian batsman Jack Ledward . The family moved to Armadale , and young Loxton attended Armadale Public School before completing his secondary education at Wesley College , Melbourne , an elite private boys ’ school . One of his colleagues at Wesley College was Ian Johnson , a future teammate for Victoria and Australia . The boys ’ school coach was P. L. Williams , a renowned mentor of teenagers who had earlier coached Ross Gregory and future Test captain Lindsay Hassett . Away from his sporting commitments at school , Loxton played district cricket for Prahran 's third grade team when he was just 12 . The young cricketer 's parents were stalwarts of the club ; Sam Sr. was the scorer and served as a transport man , driving the matting and equipment to matches , while Annie made cucumber sandwiches for 25 years — due to the economic difficulties caused by the Great Depression and World War II , meat catering for players was a luxury even at first @-@ class and international matches . The elder Sam was a member of the club committee from 1941 until his death in 1974 , and was a vice @-@ president for the last 17 years of his life . At the age of 16 , the younger Loxton was selected in the Victorian Cricket Association Colts team that played in the first grade competition in 1937 – 38 ; he played three seasons with the outfit , which was effectively a state youth team . The squad was coached by Bert Cohen and former Test batsman and captain Jack Ryder , and Loxton credited the latter as the biggest influence on his career , saying 
 He was an inspiration so far as I was concerned . He had so much to do with my early grounding . Old Jack never had a drink and never smoked a cigarette in his life and nobody walked so tall as that man . He was my cricket father , no doubt about that at all . 
 Loxton improved significantly in his third season with the Colts , scoring his first century and taking 21 wickets , having managed only seven scalps in the two previous summers . In 1940 – 41 , aged 19 , he moved back to Prahran to play in their first grade team after the Colts were disbanded , and he became more productive over the next few years , taking 46 wickets in one season . 
 Loxton also played Australian rules football , and in 1942 , he made his debut in the Victorian Football League ( VFL ) — the highest tier of competition at the time — playing for St Kilda . One of his teammates was Keith Miller , a future Invincibles colleague . Loxton played as both a forward and a defender , and the pair sometimes played together in attack . The recruit from Prahran played in only six matches in his first year , kicking 15 goals . Debuting in round six , he started his career brightly , kicking five and four goals in his first two matches against Melbourne and Collingwood respectively , helping his team to two victories . However , the goals and victories began to dry up and Loxton managed only six goals and one win in the remaining four matches . St Kilda came second to last and did not make the finals . 
 During World War II , Loxton served with the 2nd Armoured Division . He enlisted on 31 July 1942 at Oakleigh , Victoria and was discharged on 7 November 1945 with the rank of sergeant , having spent most of his time at the division headquarters . The war ended Loxton and Miller ’ s partnership at St Kilda . Miller was deployed to South Australia for training before becoming a fighter pilot in England , while his St Kilda colleague served in a reserve unit in Melbourne , enabling him to continue his football career when granted leave . In 1943 , Loxton played in only the last four matches of the season , all of which were lost , kicking seven goals , and St Kilda finished last with a solitary victory from ten games . He managed three goals each against Essendon and South Melbourne but was held goal @-@ less against Melbourne . The following year , Loxton played in all 18 matches and topped St Kilda ’ s goal @-@ kicking aggregates with 52 . After making a slow start to the season , aggregating only four goals in the first four matches , including two goal @-@ less outings , he began to score more heavily . The St Kilda forward registered a six @-@ goal haul against Geelong in round eight , helping to secure an away win , and scored 23 goals in the last six matches , including five in each of the last three matches . However , St Kilda won only one of these three matches . Loxton 's efforts helped his club to finish ninth out of 12 teams , and he came second in the club Best and Fairest . He played a solitary match in 1945 , which St Kilda lost , and went goal @-@ less . 
 = = First @-@ class and Test debut = = 
 An attacking right @-@ handed middle @-@ order batsman and a right @-@ arm fast @-@ medium bowler , Loxton spent much of his cricket career in the shadow of Miller , who played the same type of role . Upon Miller 's death in 2004 , he said " I was in Keith 's shadow all my career ... and it was a pretty big shadow . " First @-@ class cricket resumed in 1945 – 46 after the end of the war , but Loxton failed to gain state selection during the season . He played his final VFL season in 1946 and was chosen in 12 of St Kilda ’ s 19 games , kicking 40 goals . However , his team only won two of these 12 matches , and finished second last . Loxton had a strong start to his final season , kicking 34 goals in the first 8 rounds . This included a career best of eight goals in another away win over Geelong . He also added six goals apiece against Footscray and Collingwood , but it was not enough to prevent defeats . However , Loxton missed three matches after the eighth round and upon his return , struggled and managed only six goals in his last four matches for St Kilda . 
 Having retired from top @-@ tier football , Loxton soon broke into first @-@ class cricket . He was selected for Victoria to make his debut in the match against Queensland in December 1946 because five players , including Miller , were playing in a Test match for Australia against England during their Test tour . The debutant scored 232 not out , sharing a Victorian record sixth @-@ wicket partnership of 289 with Doug Ring , who made 145 . When he had scored 183 , Loxton hit himself on the head with his bat in attempting a hook shot , but continued batting until the end of Victoria ’ s innings and then opened the bowling in Queensland ’ s innings . He took the first wicket before going off to hospital with concussion . Recovering in time to bowl in the second innings , he took 2 wickets for 40 runs ( 2 / 40 ) in an innings win . Loxton 's 232 not out remains a record debut score in Australian first @-@ class cricket . His debut performance was enough for him to keep his place when the Test players returned , and he scored 73 and took a total of 3 / 17 in the next match against arch @-@ rivals New South Wales , which Victoria won by an innings . He compiled 87 in the next match against Queensland , and Victoria won all but one of the five Sheffield Shield matches in which he played — the only draw was washed out — to claim the title . The all @-@ rounder finished the season atop Victoria 's batting averages , with 429 runs at a batting average of 143 @.@ 00 . He also headed the bowling averages with 8 wickets at 14 @.@ 00 runs apiece . 
 The following season , Loxton 's record was less spectacular despite playing in all but one of Victoria ’ s matches . He hit 77 and 35 not out in the opening match of the summer against the Indian tourists , and was rewarded with selection in an Australian XI to play the visitors ahead of the Tests . In what was effectively a Test trial , the uncapped all @-@ rounder failed to impress with the bat , making a duck and six . He bowled extensively , sending down 47 overs and taking a total of 4 / 113 as the Australians fell to a defeat . Loxton was passed over for Test selection and returned to domestic competition , scoring 53 and taking a total of 4 / 56 in the next match against New South Wales , which the Victorians won by nine wickets . He then went into an unproductive sequence , failing to pass 31 and taking only three wickets in his next four matches over a two @-@ month period . His seven wickets in the Sheffield Shield games cost almost 49 runs each . Despite this , the Australian captain Don Bradman had been impressed by what he saw of Loxton at domestic level , and the Victorian all @-@ rounder was chosen for the Fifth and final Test against India . With the series already convincingly won 3 – 0 , Australia decided to rest several players in order to trial up and coming cricketers ahead of the 1948 tour of England . Len Johnson , Loxton and fellow Victorian Ring were thus given their Test debuts . 
 Australia batted first and Loxton came in to bat in front of a supportive home crowd at the Melbourne Cricket Ground . He made 80 , putting on 159 with fellow Victorian Neil Harvey , who made his first Test century in his second international match , as Australia amassed 8 / 575 . The debutant all @-@ rounder said that he was nervous but Harvey " was going along merrily and he soon settled me down " . Bradman fell ill and Bill Brown led the Australians in the field during the first innings . Understanding that one of the objectives was to give the new players an opportunity to show their talent , Brown threw the ball to his debutants . Johnson was given the ball first change , but failed to make an impact , so Loxton was handed his chance . He had a catch dropped early on but ended with 2 / 61 in the first innings , removing Hemu Adhikari and then Vinoo Mankad . In the words of Brown , the Victorian all @-@ rounder " looked twice the bowler Johnson did " . The Victorian debutant took the wicket of Adhikari in the second innings as Australia enforced the follow on and skittled India by 67 to win by an innings . The Test debut performance won Loxton a place on the Invincibles tour to England in 1948 . He reflected that " It 's not the fellow who gets the opportunity it 's the fellow who puts his hands around it and grabs it . I just happened to be in the right place at the right time . " After his position in the touring party was confirmed , he continued his late @-@ season resurgence , scoring two fifties for the Australians in two matches against Tasmania before they departed for England . 
 = = Invincibles tour = = 
 Loxton started his English campaign slowly . Australia typically selected their strongest team for the tour opener against Worcestershire , and the all @-@ rounder was omitted as the visitors won by an innings . As the Australians often played six days a week , they employed a rotation policy in the county matches , and in the second game against Leicestershire , Loxton made his debut on English soil . He made only four , before opening the bowling in both innings and taking a total of 1 / 23 in an innings victory . His attempts to break into the first @-@ choice team were hampered by a groin strain he suffered in the third match against Yorkshire when he was striving for extra pace in his only over in the first innings . As a result , he played no further part in the match . One man down , Australia came closest to losing for the whole tour . They fell to 6 / 31 in pursuit of 60 — effectively seven down with Loxton unable to bat — before scraping home without further loss after Yorkshire dropped both batsmen . 
 The injured all @-@ rounder missed two matches to recuperate before reappearing in mid @-@ May , hitting 120 as the Australians posted a total of 721 against Essex in a single day at Southend , still the highest single day 's total in first @-@ class cricket . He put on 166 in 65 minutes with Ron Saggers , who , with Bill Brown and Donald Bradman , also scored centuries . Loxton 's rapid innings was noted for its hooking and driving and took around 80 minutes . He followed up with an unbeaten 79 and two wickets in the match against Oxford University , but that failed to win him a place in the first set @-@ piece battle of the summer , against the Marylebone Cricket Club at Lord 's . The MCC fielded seven players who would represent England in the Tests , and were basically a full @-@ strength Test outfit , while Australia fielded their strongest XI , so the fixture was effectively a dress rehearsal for the Tests . Bradman opted to play Brown out of the position in the middle @-@ order , and Loxton missed out ; Australia went on to win by an innings . 
 Loxton then played in each of Australia ’ s four remaining tour games before the Tests , but was unable to do enough to force his way into the first @-@ choice team . He made 39 and 52 against Lancashire , and 16 against Nottinghamshire , squandering his starts in the latter two innings to run outs . In the match against Hampshire , he made one in his only innings after Australia were caught on a damp pitch and took a solitary wicket . The Australian team 's batting depth did not help Loxton ’ s cause ; in the final pre @-@ Test match against Sussex , a match won by an innings and 325 runs , he was slated to bat at No. 9 , but Australia ’ s earlier batsmen were largely untroubled so Bradman declared at 5 / 549 . The all @-@ rounder ’ s 3 / 13 in the first innings had the effect of removing him from the bowling line @-@ up for the rest of the match , as Doug Ring , Ernie Toshack , Ron Hamence and Ian Johnson helped Ray Lindwall to bowl the touring team to an easy victory . Loxton had limited opportunities as those ahead of him tended to finish off the opposition before his turn , and did not score heavily enough when he had a chance , so he was overlooked for the First Test at Trent Bridge . Bradman again opted to use Brown out of position in the middle @-@ order as Australia took an eight @-@ wicket win . 
 There were only two matches between the First and Second Tests . Loxton took a total of 2 / 29 and scored only 17 against Northamptonshire , and was rested against Yorkshire . Brown made a century in the latter match , and Australia fielded an unchanged team for the Second Test at Lord 's and completed another victory . As the tour reached its halfway point , the Victorian began to make an impression . In the next county game , his opening partnership with Neil Harvey scored the 122 runs needed to beat Surrey in only 58 minutes , Loxton making 47 . He also took a total 3 / 90 for the match , bowling 43 overs as Bradman allowed his main bowlers to recuperate after the previous Test . In the following match against Gloucestershire he contributed an unbeaten 159 including four sixes , as Australia made their highest score for the summer , 7 / 774 declared . The all @-@ rounder 's innings involved a series of powerful strokes and he was particularly noted for using his feet to charge and attack the off spin of Tom Goddard . The Gloucestershire bowler had been touted as a possible Test selection , because the other England bowlers had failed to contain Australia ’ s batsman in the first two matches , but his chances of selection were ended by the tourists ’ assault at Bristol . 
 These performances won Loxton selection for the Third Test , played at Old Trafford , where he replaced Brown , who had struggled in the middle @-@ order , averaging less than 25 in the unfamiliar environment . The match was the most evenly contested Test of the series , with England in control before four sessions were lost to rain on the last two days , resulting in a draw . Loxton bowled 15 overs in all without success , and made 36 runs batting at No. 7 in the first innings , helping Australia to avoid the follow on . In the first innings , he ran out Alec Bedser , ending a 121 @-@ run partnership between Bedser and Denis Compton . 
 The Victorian all @-@ rounder then top @-@ scored with 123 and took a total of 4 / 48 in a nine @-@ wicket win in the intervening county match against Middlesex at Lord ’ s , and he retained his place in the side for the Fourth Test at Leeds . Loxton was not involved in the second inning effort in which the Australians scored 3 / 404 on the final day , a world record for a successful Test run @-@ chase , but he had taken three of the last four wickets in England ’ s first innings of 496 and scored a hard @-@ hitting 93 in the first innings , putting on 105 in 95 minutes with Harvey . Their counterattacking partnership helped Australia to halt the English momentum after an early collapse ; the score was still 4 / 189 when Loxton came in to bat . He was particularly severe on Jim Laker , lifting his off breaks into the crowd for four of his five sixes , mostly from lofted drives . With a maiden Test century beckoning , the Victorian swung wildly at a Norman Yardley ball and was bowled . In the dressing room , Sir Robert Menzies , a Prime Minister of Australia well known as a cricket @-@ lover , upbraided him , saying " That was a pretty stupid thing to do . You could have made a century " , to which the fallen batsman retorted , " Haven ’ t you made a few mistakes in your time , too ? " Nevertheless , Australia eventually proceeded from 6 / 329 at the time of Loxton ’ s departure to end on 458 , almost nullifying the effect of England ’ s strong first innings total . 
 Immediately after the Fourth Test , Loxton scored 51 and took a total of 4 / 43 in an innings victory over Derbyshire , but was less productive in his remaining three matches before the Fifth Test , totaling only four wickets and 17 runs in three completed innings . He retained his position for the final Test of the series , but had little to do in an innings victory . He was only required to bowl two overs in the first innings as the frontline pacemen cut down the hosts for only 52 , and then scored 15 in Australia 's reply of 389 . In the second innings he bowled ten overs without taking a wicket . The Victorian all @-@ rounder was not prominent in his four matches after the Tests , totaling only 112 runs and five wickets . His most successful returns were four wickets for the match in an innings victory over Kent , and a quickfire 67 not out in 75 minutes against the South of England . In the final match of the England leg of the tour — there were two matches in Scotland afterwards — he hit a ball from Freddie Brown into his face , breaking his nose , thus forcing him to miss the final two matches in Scotland . 
 On the tour as a whole , Loxton scored 973 runs at an average of 57 @.@ 23 and took 32 wickets at 21 @.@ 71 . Such was the strength of the team he was only fifth in the batting averages and eighth among the bowlers . Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack summed up his contribution thus : 
 A fine driving batsman with a fierce square cut , Loxton achieved little as a bowler , but he played his part as an all @-@ rounder , one of many in the team ; in addition to his batting feats , he kept the game alive by his unlimited enthusiasm . Whether in stopping the ball or hurling down the wicket from almost any angle , he won the admiration of all who appreciated keenness in the field . 
 = = Heading for South Africa = = 
 There were no Tests during the 1948 – 49 season in Australia , with only domestic matches scheduled . Loxton played regularly for Victoria , scoring 500 runs in the Sheffield Shield , compiling 135 against South Australia and 84 against Queensland . He scored 60 and took a total of 5 / 77 in one match against New South Wales , but Victoria was unable to win either match against their arch @-@ rivals , who took the title . 
 Two big set @-@ piece matches , a testimonial match for Bradman and a joint benefit for Alan Kippax and Bert Oldfield , were used by the selectors as a trial for the 1949 – 50 South African tour . Loxton played in both testimonial matches ; he failed to pass 21 in the first match but took a total of 4 / 100 . In the latter match he scored 93 . The Victorian all @-@ rounder ended the season with 634 runs at 42 @.@ 26 and 16 wickets at 24 @.@ 31 and was selected for the South African tour under the leadership of the newly appointed captain Lindsay Hassett . 
 Like the Invincibles tour , the 1949 – 50 Test series in South Africa was another triumph for the Australians . They won four of the five Tests and were undefeated in 21 first @-@ class matches . Loxton started the tour strongly , making 117 in the opening match against Zululand , which was not first @-@ class . He continued his productivity in the succeeding games , never failing to pass 40 in any completed innings in the first five first @-@ class matches of the tour . This included an all @-@ round effort of 76 not out and a total of 4 / 10 in an innings victory over Orange Free State . However , the Victorian 's form slumped just before the Tests . He made single figure scores in his last three innings , including in the last match against a South African XI in what was effectively a dry run for the Tests . However , he did take 4 / 32 for the match . 
 Loxton played in all five Tests , and in the First Test at the Wanderers in Johannesburg , he scored his first Test century . He compiled 101 in 150 minutes , helping Australia to a total of 413 after both opening batsmen were out without scoring . Hassett ’ s men went on to win the match by an innings . The Second Test was an eight @-@ wicket victory for the Australians , this time dominated by Harvey 's 178 , with whom Loxton shared a 140 @-@ run stand for the fifth wicket , contributing 35 himself . He also took a wicket . The Third Test at Kingsmead in Durban was dramatic ; batting first , South Africa made 311 and Hugh Tayfield then took 7 / 23 as Australia collapsed to 75 all out after the rain and sun had baked the playing surface into a sticky wicket . During the first innings , Hassett changed his batting order so that his better batsmen were low down in the order so that they could bat in better conditions as the pitch stabilised . Loxton batted at No. 10 and Harvey at No. 9 , but the Australians collapsed before the pitch had changed measurably . Not enforcing the follow @-@ on , the South Africans batted again and were themselves bowled out for 99 , losing their last seven wickets for 14 runs . This left Australia to chase 336 runs for victory , highly unlikely as the last 28 wickets had fallen for only 245 . The tourists were still more than 200 runs in arrears when Loxton came in to join Harvey . On Loxton ’ s first ball , a delivery from Tayfield narrowly missed his edge . He survived to lunch after being caught from a no ball on the long on boundary from a lofted drive . With an unbeaten 151 , Harvey took Australia to an improbable five @-@ wicket victory , supported by his fellow Victorian , who scored 54 in a century partnership . 
 The Fourth Test of the series was a high @-@ scoring draw , Loxton making six in his only innings . His 43 in the final Test of the series was overshadowed by centuries for three of his team @-@ mates , in an innings win that sealed the series 4 – 0 . In the Test series as a whole , the Victorian all @-@ rounder made 255 runs at an average of 42 @.@ 50 , but bowled only 34 overs in taking two wickets . He made little impact on the tour matches after the start of the Tests , passing fifty twice and taking two wickets from 13 overs in five matches . For the entire tour , Loxton totaled 809 first @-@ class runs at 40 @.@ 45 and took 12 wickets . 
 = = Final Tests = = 
 Loxton had an unproductive time during the 1950 – 51 Australian season . He lost his Test place after three matches , and in Sheffield Shield games his highest score for the season was just 62 . In the first match of the season , he made four for Victoria against Freddie Brown 's touring team , a portent of the coming season . However , he did bounce back in the final match before the Tests , scoring 62 and 37 and taking 3 / 24 against New South Wales . The First Test of the Ashes series at Brisbane was decided largely by a tropical storm that completely changed the nature of the pitch after the first day . The Australian all @-@ rounder had by then been the victim of a spectacular catch by England wicket @-@ keeper Godfrey Evans , making 24 in Australia 's 228 . He picked up five catches — his first Test catches in his tenth match — as the Australians surrounded the English batsmen , who made 7 / 68 on the sticky wicket before Brown declared to force the Australian batsmen to suffer on the treacherous surface . Loxton was out for a duck in the second innings , unable to cope with the conditions , as did most of his compatriots . Australia collapsed to 3 / 0 before reaching 7 / 32 , at which point Hassett declared after 78 minutes of batting . England fell to 6 / 30 at stumps in pursuit of 193 . Twenty wickets had fallen in four hours , while only 102 runs had been scored . Australia eventually won the match by 71 runs . 
 In the Second Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground , his last at his home ground , Loxton 's 32 formed part of a stand of 84 with Hassett , the highest partnership in a closely fought , low @-@ scoring game in which no team passed 200 . He again failed in the second innings , scoring two as Australia scraped home by 28 runs . After contributing 17 in a total of 426 in the Third Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground , which Australia won by an innings to take an unassailable 3 – 0 series lead , he was dropped in favour of Jim Burke , who scored a century on debut . The Victorian never played Test cricket again . 
 Loxton returned to play for Victoria , and although he struggled for runs , managing only three fifties for the season , wickets came regularly . He took match totals of 4 / 55 and 3 / 24 against Queensland , 4 / 55 against South Australia and 2 / 23 against Western Australia ; Victoria won all four matches , and claimed the Sheffield Shield . Playing in seven of the eight matches , he scored 309 runs at 30 @.@ 90 and taking 16 wickets at 12 @.@ 56 . 
 = = Later cricket = = 
 Although his Test career had finished , Loxton continued to play for his state . He had another disappointing season with the bat in 1951 – 52 , scoring only 322 runs at 24 @.@ 76 in nine matches . After winning the opening match of the season against Western Australia , he did not taste victory again until the final fixture of the summer against South Australia , in which he scored 71 — his only fifty of the season — and took a total of 4 / 37 in an innings victory . Victoria lost three times and would have suffered a fourth defeat but for Loxton ’ s unbeaten 41 against Queensland , which helped them to hold on for a draw with one wicket intact . He continued to take regular wickets , ending with 21 scalps at 31 @.@ 00 for the season , including an innings best of 4 / 56 , but he managed a total of only 4 / 249 against New South Wales , who went on to win the competition . 
 Loxton had a more productive campaign during the 1952 – 53 season , scoring 470 runs at 33 @.@ 57 and taking 23 wickets at 26 @.@ 26 in nine matches . He broke through for his first first @-@ class century in three years when he made 169 against New South Wales , but it was not enough to prevent an innings defeat . He scored 60 and took a match total of 5 / 102 in a match for Victoria against the touring South Africans early in the season , but this was not enough for him to regain his Test position . He bowled with steady results throughout the season , never taking more than three wickets in an innings and five in a match . 
 In 1953 – 54 , Loxton was part of a Commonwealth team that toured India during the Australian season , playing in 15 first @-@ class matches . He played in all five of the matches that were termed as " unofficial Tests " on this tour . The Victorian 's first month on tour was <unk> by his bowling . He took 12 wickets at 19 @.@ 75 but scored only 115 runs at 23 @.@ 00 without passing 25 in the first four matches . 
 Loxton had no success in the first representative match , scoring 2 and 6 and taking 0 / 72 in an innings defeat . However , his fortunes turned in the next match against Bombay , when he took 5 / 92 , the first five @-@ wicket innings haul in his first @-@ class career . He also scored 123 , but was unable to force a victory . He carried the form into the next representative match , scoring 55 and taking a total of 3 / 99 in a drawn encounter . The Victorian continued his all @-@ round form against Bengal , scoring 100 and taking 5 / 87 in an innings victory . His form tapered away thereafter and he failed to pass 40 and took only a total of only four wickets in the three remaining representative matches . The Commonwealth outfit won the third match but lost the fourth , ceding the series 2 – 1 . Loxton ended the tour with 647 runs at 35 @.@ 94 and 33 wickets at 31 @.@ 90 , but struggled in the matches against India , scoring 148 runs at 21 @.@ 14 and taking 7 wickets at 56 @.@ 14 . 
 After returning to Australia , Loxton had a torrid time with the bat in the 1954 – 55 season , scoring only 126 runs at 14 @.@ 00 and failing to pass 30 in his six matches . He took 12 wickets at 32 @.@ 41 for the season , the least number of wickets in any of his first @-@ class seasons . The all @-@ rounder ’ s best effort was a 4 / 31 against New South Wales in a match that Victoria lost by nine wickets . Loxton had a more productive summer in 1955 – 56 . In seven matches , he scored 286 runs at 40 @.@ 85 including an unbeaten century against South Australia , and took 14 wickets at 20 @.@ 07 ; his best was a 4 / 35 in the return match against South Australia . The Sheffield Shield was won by Victoria ’ s bitter rivals New South Wales in both seasons . 
 In 1956 – 57 , his penultimate season for Victoria , Loxton — aged nearly 36 — scored 134 and took 2 / 30 to orchestrate an innings victory over South Australia in the second match of the summer . In the penultimate match of the season , which effectively determined the fate of the Sheffield Shield , the Victorian all @-@ rounder took 4 / 44 to help dismiss New South Wales for 149 and take a 292 @-@ run first innings lead . However , the defending champions hung on for a draw to ensure the retention of their title . Loxton then surpassed his previous career best by taking 6 / 49 against Western Australia to set up a nine @-@ wicket win in the last match of the season . 
 Loxton retired after playing in the 1957 – 58 season . With the Test players in South Africa , he made 331 runs at 41 @.@ 37 including 2 centuries , and took 9 wickets at 26 @.@ 33 in 8 matches . He made 107 in an innings triumph over Queensland and 106 in a drawn match against South Australia . It was not enough for him to win a third Sheffield Shield title ; New South Wales won for the fifth successive time , defeating Victoria in both of their matches . Loxton made little impact in his final match ; although the Victorians defeated Queensland , his only participation was to score five runs in the first innings . His highest score remained the 232 not out he had made on his first @-@ class debut . 
 Loxton continued to play for Prahran until 1962 – 63 , and he topped the batting and bowling averages for the club on five and six occasions respectively . He topped both the batting and bowling averages in the same season on four occasions . The all @-@ rounder scored a total of 6 @,@ 032 runs and took 351 wickets during his first grade career , and was named the captain of the club 's honorary Team of the Century . 
 = = Style = = 
 An aggressive right @-@ handed all @-@ rounder , Loxton tended to bat in the middle @-@ order , and bowled after the new ball pacemen . As well as being a belligerent batsman , he was a right @-@ arm fast @-@ medium swing bowler known for his ability to move the ball , and a powerful outfielder . He had a strong arm and exploited his power frequently , to the extent that the Australian wicket @-@ keeper Don Tallon complained about the jarring impact of his unnecessarily strong throws when the batsmen were already home and no run out was possible . Loxton was known for his energetic and aggressive approach to cricket , and liked to attack and intimidate opposition batsmen . In one match in the late @-@ 1950s , he bowled an eight @-@ ball over at New South Welshman Norm O 'Neill consisting entirely of bouncers aimed at the upper body . Loxton was not afraid of opposition bowlers doing the same to him ; he had a penchant for trying to hook bouncers out of the ground . He was a predominantly back @-@ foot player whose initial foot @-@ movement tended to be back and towards and then across the stumps . When he committed to a back foot shot , Loxton often made such a decisive retreat that he almost stepped onto his stumps . One painter once captured the Victorian almost disturbing the woodwork with his right leg , leading Loxton to quip " That 's what I call using the crease " . Hassett said that his fellow Victorian " really used to give everything he had all the time ... Put him on to bowl and he 'd bowl his hardest , no matter how he felt . " Bradman said that Loxton " never shirked the issue " and that " he ’ d throw himself into it with everything he had . This is one of the reasons he was a great team man . You could call on him at any stage and he ’ d give you his very best . " Bradman said that the Victorian all @-@ rounder " was never a great cricketer in the sense that some others were great , but he was a very good player and what he lacked in ability he made up for in effort " . He further added that the Victorian was " the very essence of belligerence ... His whole attitude suggests defiance and when he hits the ball it is the music of a sledgehammer . " Former Test leg spinner Bill O 'Reilly , while agreeing that Loxton was always energetic , regarded his bowling as being too dull and predictable to have any major impact at the highest level , and thought that the Victorian all @-@ rounder ’ s career would have been best served by saving his energy purely for batting . 
 As a footballer , Loxton usually played as a forward , but was also used as a full @-@ back and alternated between the two positions . He was known for his physical strength ; another VFL player who had a reputation as an " enforcer " tried to bump him and later said that the collision made him feel as though he had run into a goalpost . According to Robert Coleman , Loxton was " competitive , pugnacious and outspoken , with a doglike loyalty to everyone and everything he served , whether it was his captain , his team , his party , his premier or his constituents . " 
 = = Manager in 1959 – 60 = = 
 Loxton was the manager of the 1959 – 60 Australian team that toured Pakistan and India . By this time , only two colleagues from the 1948 Invincibles tour — Harvey and Ray Lindwall — remained . The Victorian was the first manager since World War II to not also be a member of the Australian Board of Control . It was widely believed that the high @-@ ranking administrators saw the Indian subcontinent as an unenviable appointment ; on past tours , many players had fallen seriously ill , suffered food poisoning , and found the oppressive heat and third world living conditions hard to bear . Some players were reluctant to tour and wanted to opt out . Loxton felt that his experience with the Commonwealth XI six years earlier was a factor in his selection and suspected that he was the only applicant , quipping " what board member would be silly enough to go there ? " 
 Loxton was known for his blunt nature , and his appointment to a post that required him to liaise with cricket officials from opposing nations raised eyebrows . The cricket historian Gideon Haigh wrote " Thoughts of such a gruff , soldierly man acting the diplomat had caused great ribaldry " . In a speech at a cricket dinner , his former captain Hassett joked " I would advise Mr [ Prime Minister ] Menzies to have army and navy standing by . A week after Sam gets to India , war is bound to break out . " 
 On the field , the Australians — captained by Richie Benaud — were successful . They defeated Pakistan 2 – 0 in three Tests , and India 2 – 1 over five matches . Australia ’ s only other Test win on Pakistani soil came in 1998 and they have only won two series in India since the Benaud @-@ Loxton expedition . They also remained unbeaten outside the Test matches . Despite the success with bat and ball , the Australians were struck down by serious illness during the second part of their tour in India , despite taking Dr. Ian McDonald — a former Victorian first @-@ class cricketer — with the travelling party . Gordon Rorke , Lindsay Kline and Gavin Stevens all contracted hepatitis ; the former two were sent home , while the latter was too ill to fly back to Australia until the end of the tour . Harvey said that Stevens — who never played first @-@ class cricket again after his illness — " could 've been the first man to die on tour " . Due to the bevy of unfit players , Loxton was forced to line up in one game , against Indian Universities in Bangalore , two years after playing his last first @-@ class match . He scored 33 and bowled six overs without taking a wicket in a high @-@ scoring draw . 
 There were several administrative difficulties during the tour . Bill Dowling — the chairman of the Australian Board of Control — had informed Loxton that no Test match was to begin until a receipt for 6 @,@ 500 pounds had been handed over to Australian authorities . The Australian manager had also been told to rebuff any Pakistani overtures for a reciprocal tour , as it was feared that they lacked public appeal and would have caused financial losses due to a fall in ticket sales . Despite previous assurances to prepare turf pitches , the locals made a matting surface for the First Test . During the Second Test , when asked by General Ayub Khan — head of the ruling military junta — why Pakistan had not been invited to Australia , Loxton exploited the opportunity to complain about the wickets . When the tourists were greeted by another matting track in the Third Test , Ayub threatened to shoot the groundsmen if they prepared any more non @-@ turf surfaces . The financial issue reared its head before the Second Test against India in Kanpur , when Loxton belligerently refused to start the match after the payment had failed to arrive on time . An Indian official asked the Australian manager to not " spoil a beautiful friendship over money " , to which the Australian manager replied " Try me . I want it please ... You know the rules . " The match proceeded after the cheque was delivered , and India inflicted Australia 's only defeat for the tour and their first Test win over the visitors . Another mishap occurred during the Fifth Test at Eden Gardens in Calcutta ; the Australians left their hotel and took to the field with ten men , having failed to notice that Ian Meckiff had overslept and been left behind by the team bus . During the First Test against Pakistan in Dacca , one of the umpires took off his shoes and put them on the ground while play was in progress . Loxton took a photo of the scene and lodged it to cricket authorities , asking them to make a ruling on whether a batsman would be out if the ball struck the umpire ’ s loose shoes and bounced up into a fielder ’ s hands . However , he never received a reply . 
 = = Political career = = 
 Loxton joined the Armadale branch of the Liberal Party in 1950 . Henry Bolte , the Liberal leader in Victoria , was the state opposition leader at the time , and encouraged him to enter politics . The cricketer ’ s entry into electoral politics came after he was involved in a debate at a cricket club meeting . A person at the gathering reported his argumentative performance to senior Liberal Party figures , and soon after , Bolte began actively courting the cricketer . On 28 September 1954 , Loxton won pre @-@ selection and was endorsed as the Liberal candidate for the electorate of Prahran . At the time , the seat was comfortably held by the ruling Australian Labor Party ( ALP ) , who had captured 61 @.@ 59 % of the vote at the previous election . The Liberals were not optimistic about their chances , and Bolte told his candidate " You won 't win [ the seat ] , but we 'd like you to fly the flag " . 
 The cricketer refused to think that his candidacy was simply there to make up the numbers , and he told Bolte as much . The start of the election campaign coincided with the 1954 – 55 grade cricket finals . Loxton took 7 wickets and scored 129 runs to help Prahran claim the title for the first time in 32 years , and was hailed as a local hero . It capped off a season in which he topped the competition batting averages and took the most wickets . In a close @-@ run contest , the cricketer defeated the sitting ALP member Bob Pettiona by only 14 votes on the two party preferred count . He was aided by preferences from the Democratic Labor Party ( DLP ) , which had broken away from the ALP during the 1950s , claiming that it was too soft towards communism ; fears of left @-@ wing influence was causing great concern in Australian society at the time . Loxton polled 35 @.@ 70 % of the first preferences , well behind Pettiona 's 47 @.@ 25 % , but received almost all of the DLP 's 13 @.@ 66 % of the vote as preferences to end with 50 @.@ 04 % . The result helped bring Bolte 's Liberals to power , and they stayed in office until 1982 , by which time Loxton had retired . 
 Loxton entered the Victorian parliament in 1955 , and served as government whip from 1961 until his retirement in 1979 . At the time of his election , he was the youngest member of parliament , and was given the honour of making the Address @-@ in @-@ Reply , the first speech after opening of the new sitting by the governor , using it to advocate increased lending from the government @-@ owned banks to promote higher levels of home ownership . At the 1958 election , Loxton consolidated his hold on the seat , leading on first preferences ( 43 @.@ 67 % ) , and ending with 54 @.@ 85 % of the two party preferred vote to halt Pettiona 's attempted comeback . During the election campaign in 1961 , a campaign meeting in Prahran that was attended by Premier Bolte and Loxton drew several hundred people and descended into chaos ; heckling and some scuffles broke out . At this election , the Liberals ' primary vote fell to 41 @.@ 69 % behind the Labor Party 's candidate George Gahan 45 @.@ 29 % , and he had to rely on DLP preferences to retain the seat with a reduced two party preferred vote of 52 @.@ 71 % . The Liberals may have been hindered by a how @-@ to @-@ vote card circulated on election day by a third party that had a pro @-@ Liberal headline , but instructed the reader to mark the ALP candidate as their first preference . Loxton managed to secure a court injunction — believed to be the first of its kind in Victoria — prohibiting further distribution of the material , but not before hundreds of misleading instructions had been disseminated . 
 In 1964 , Loxton increased his primary vote to 45 @.@ 77 % and defeated Pettiona for the third time , ending with a fairly safe 57 @.@ 72 % after the distribution of preferences . In 1967 , the retired cricketer repelled a political challenge by Jack Dyer , an iconic former footballer of the Richmond Tigers famed as one of the toughest players in history , and retained his seat at further elections in 1970 , 1973 and 1976 before opting to retire at the 1979 poll . Without Loxton 's personal appeal , the Liberals lost the seat to the ALP upon his departure . As he continued to play first @-@ class cricket for three years after his election to parliament , he was a busy man , and team @-@ mates described him as a hard @-@ working representative , recalling that he often brought his political paperwork to the ground with him , going through the material while waiting in the dressing room for his turn to bat . Although he was a low @-@ key presence in the parliamentary chambers , Loxton served on the library committee from 1958 to 1961 , and he was known for his work ethic and thorough approach , as well as his " sporting charisma " . 
 = = Cricket administration = = 
 Loxton continued to involve himself in cricket administration after his retirement as a player . He was a Victorian selector from 1957 to 1980 – 81 and the Prahran delegate to the Victorian Cricket Association ( VCA ) from 1955 – 56 to 1979 – 80 . Loxton was Prahran 's vice president and was involved in coaching and selecting teams , and his service to the club was honoured with life membership . He served as a MCG trustee from 1962 to 1982 . The Victorian was appointed as the manager for Australia 's tour of India in 1969 – 70 but had to withdraw due to a clash of commitments . In his absence , the campaign hit rocky waters . Although Australia won 3 – 1 , the players became disgruntled with the arrangements made by the administrators , while rancorous incidents leading to crowd riots were frequent . 
 He was a Test selector for the Australian team from 1970 to 1981 , filling the vacancy left by the retirement of former Test captain Ryder . Loxton 's tenure on the selection panel coincided with a period of great upheaval in Australian cricket , on and off the field . Up until 1965 , Australia had never lost a Test series to any country other than England , and their bilateral contests were regarded as the de facto world championship . However , in the next five years , Australia lost away to the West Indies 2 – 1 , and to South Africa twice , 3 – 1 and 4 – 0 respectively . The former all @-@ rounder became a selector after the whitewash in South Africa , joining Bradman and Harvey on the panel . During the 1970 – 71 home series against England , which Australia lost 2 – 1 , the trio made a raft of changes , handing debuts to nine players , the largest number in a season since 1945 – 46 when competition resumed after World War II . One of the new players that Harvey and Loxton recommended to Bradman was Dennis Lillee , who went on to become one of Australia 's greatest fast bowlers and the world ’ s leading wicket @-@ taker . However , the season ended acrimoniously when captain Bill Lawry was sacked before the final Test without being informed of his fate ; he only learned of his omission second hand . 
 In 1977 , Loxton helped to select David Hookes to make his debut in the Centenary Test , after receiving a recommendation from Bradman , who had retired from the panel . Hookes famously struck five consecutive fours in one Tony Greig over in an Australian win . The later period of Loxton 's tenure was thrown into chaos when most of the leading players abandoned the existing establishment to sign contracts with the breakaway World Series Cricket — which offered substantially more remuneration — meaning that an almost @-@ entirely new team had to be cobbled together ; the 42 @-@ year @-@ old Bob Simpson was brought out of a decade of retirement to lead the outfit . During this time , Australia 's depleted team suffered many heavy defeats . 
 During the 1970s , Loxton also became more disillusioned with cricket , as player behaviour deteriorated and incidences of verbal hostility and altercations increased . The former all @-@ rounder was known for his vigorous advocacy of the more sedate and gentlemanly conduct that existed during his playing days and felt that he and his fellow administrators were losing control of the sport . 
 In February 1981 , matters came to a head . Loxton , who was watching a one @-@ day international between Australia and New Zealand at the MCG in his role as a selector , broke down and wept after Australian captain Greg Chappell infamously ordered his younger brother Trevor to exploit a loophole and bowl underarm to eliminate the chance of a defeat . Loxton saw the Australian skipper 's action as a " betrayal " of cricket . He turned to a fellow official and remarked " The game 's gone ! Money has become the god and winning is everything . " 
 At a VCA meeting in April 1981 , Loxton announced that he was severing all connections with organised cricket . He initially said that he was resigning for family reasons , as he would be moving to the Gold Coast in Queensland with his wife . However , he proceeded to give a blunt 15 @-@ minute speech , claiming that he had lost the art of communicating with the players and expressing his disenchantment with some aspects of the game , a reference to the declining player conduct . After relocating to the Gold Coast , he was unable to turn his back on cricket , and umpired matches at local level into his 70s . Although he became severely visually impaired , Loxton still attended matches and asked his companions to describe the proceedings for him ; ever opinionated and blunt , he still offered advice to local cricketers . 
 = = Other work and personal life = = 
 Prior to entering politics , Loxton worked as a bank teller . In 1956 , television began in Australia , and he participated in the nation 's first generation of sports telecasting . Loxton was a commentator on <unk> @-@ 9 for the Melbourne Summer Olympics held in late 1956 , and his co @-@ commentators included American track and field icon Jesse Owens . After leaving parliament , the former politician joined the property developers Ellis , <unk> and Seward . 
 Loxton served as an administrator with various local groups . He was vice @-@ president of the Victorian School for Deaf Children , president of the Prahran Technical School Council and a member of the Prahran College of Advanced Education Council . With regards to housing and social inclusion issues , he served as a committee member of the Glen Loch Home for the Aged and chairman of the Deakin Co @-@ operative Housing Society . 
 His opinions on contemporary cricket were frequently sought . " People get a bit worried about me , " he told Cricinfo in 2008 , " Shane Warne 's been a fine bowler — no doubt about it , he 's done some wonderful things — but Bill O 'Reilly and Clarrie Grimmett , who have better strike @-@ rates per match than Warne and never played against a 2nd XI [ a reference to the likes of Bangladesh and Zimbabwe ] — they only played against the best — had no rough to bowl at . I never had to bat to a leg @-@ spinner who bowled into the rough outside my leg stump , and I played for a long time . " 
 Loxton married three times . He divorced his first wife Hilda in February 1952 after a nine @-@ year union that produced no children . The cricketer then wed Caryl Bond , whom he had met during the 1949 – 50 tour of South Africa , and the pair had two sons . Loxton later divorced Bond and wed his third wife Joan Shiels . In 2000 , one of his sons and his third wife died on the same day , due to a shark attack in Fiji and drowning in the family swimming pool , respectively . In later life he lived alone and was still mobile despite being almost blind . Loxton died on 3 December 2011 .

 = Fulfordgate = 
 Fulfordgate was an association football ground in Fulford , York , England , and was the home of York City Football Club from 1922 to 1932 . The ground was located next to Heslington Lane , and was purchased by York for £ 2 @,@ 000 following their formation in 1922 . 
 The club 's first two home matches were played at another venue as Fulfordgate was not ready , and the ground hosted its first match against Mansfield Town in September 1922 . The highest attendance at the ground was 12 @,@ 721 , which came against Sheffield United in an FA Cup match in 1931 . York decided to move to Bootham Crescent , which had been vacated by York Cricket Club in 1932 , as Fulfordgate was relatively inaccessible . The ground was sold and developed as a housing estate , and Eastward Avenue now lies at its former location . 
 = = History = = 
 Following York City F.C. ' s formation in 1922 , the club purchased 8 acres ( 3 @.@ 2 ha ) of land for £ 2 @,@ 000 in Heslington Lane , Fulford , York . This was in the south @-@ east of the city in a rural setting , which was surrounded by hawthorn hedges and was well drained . The land was known as Gate Fulford , which was reversed to become known as Fulfordgate . As the ground was not ready , York played their first two home matches at Mille Crux , <unk> Road , which was owned by Messrs Rowntree & Company Limited . The first match played at Fulfordgate was a 4 – 1 victory over Mansfield Town on 20 September 1922 , which only went ahead after director John Fisher paid the requisite deposit of £ 180 . When York applied for election into the Football League in 1927 , they stated that Fulfordgate was " splendidly drained , well equipped , spacious and capable of being extended to hold up to 40 @,@ 000 spectators " . By the time of the club 's admission into the Football League in 1929 , the ground was estimated hold a capacity of 17 @,@ 000 . When York set their then @-@ record attendance of 12 @,@ 583 against Newcastle United in an FA Cup third round replay on 15 January 1930 , approximately 4 @,@ 000 supporters had to be turned away as the gates were closed an hour before kick @-@ off . York finished the 1929 – 30 season with an average attendance of 5 @,@ 247 , higher than seventeen other Third Division North clubs . 
 Concern was expressed at York 's poor support towards the end of their third season in the Football League , and director G. W. Halliday believed the only solution was a change of ground . A major problem was the ground 's relatively inaccessible location , and in early 1932 , York held preliminary discussions about moving to Bootham Crescent , which had been vacated by York Cricket Club . A special meeting of the shareholders was held , in which chairman Arthur Brown drew attention to gate receipts figures in Fulfordgate 's three Football League seasons , which represented average crowds of 4 @,@ 000 and a deficit on the balance sheet . It was pointed out by Halliday that within one mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) of Bootham Crescent the population was 30 @,@ 000 , whereas it was only 3 @,@ 000 for a similar radius of Fulfordgate . The directors were satisfied that the new ground would fulfil all requirements , although there was some opposition to the move . Two former directors argued that attendances at many grounds had fallen during the Great Depression , and that the approaches and surrounds to Bootham Crescent were limited . Following much discussion , the decision to move to lease Bootham Crescent was approved by 115 votes to 37 , and Fulfordgate was sold and developed as a housing estate . Today , Eastward Avenue occupies the area where the ground once stood .

 Fulfordgate did not initially have any covered stands , and the dressing rooms consisted of an old army hut , before open stands were bought from York Race Committee . The ground was gradually built up and improved , and covered accommodation was available after two years . In 1927 , new turnstiles were installed and stronger fencing was built around the pitch , which made it more difficult for spectators to surmount it and access the pitch . Nine @-@ tier terracing replaced the old banking behind one of the goals , the covered Popular Stand was extended to hold 1 @,@ 000 supporters and there a small seated stand was erected .

 Fulfordgate was located in the south @-@ east of York , away from the city centre . It was a large distance from York railway station , while the tram service to Fulford only had one track , and the loop system for tramcars passing each other further restricted the service . During the ground 's existence , bus routes had not been fully developed and car ownership was not yet become common ; it was not easy for the majority of supporters to reach .

 The ground hosted the Yorkshire Flower Show and Gala in June 1924 , after the event had been held at Bootham Park for the previous sixty years .

 = Fleet Street = 
 Fleet Street is a major street in the City of London . It runs west to east from Temple Bar at the boundary with the City of Westminster to Ludgate Circus at the site of the London Wall and the River Fleet from which the street was named . 
 Having been an important through route since Roman times , businesses were established along the road during the Middle Ages . Senior clergy lived in Fleet Street during this period where there are several churches including Temple Church and St Bride 's . Fleet Street became known for printing and publishing at the start of the 16th century and it became the dominant trade so that by the 20th century most British national newspapers operated from here . Much of the industry moved out in the 1980s after News International set up cheaper manufacturing premises in Wapping , but some former newspaper buildings are listed and have been preserved . The term Fleet Street remains a metonym for the British national press , and pubs on the street once frequented by journalists remain popular . 
 Fleet Street has a significant number of monuments and statues along its length , including the dragon at Temple Bar and memorials to a number of figures from the British press , such as Samuel Pepys and Lord Northcliffe . The street is mentioned in several works by Charles Dickens and is where the legendary fictitious murderous barber Sweeney Todd lived . 
 = = Geography = = 
 Fleet Street is named after the River Fleet , which runs from Hampstead to the River Thames at the western edge of the City of London . It is one of the oldest roads outside the original city and was established by the Middle Ages . In the 13th century , it was known as Fleet Bridge Street , and in the early 14th century it became known as Fleet Street . 
 The street runs east from Temple Bar , the boundary between the Cities of London and Westminster , as a continuation of the Strand from Trafalgar Square . It crosses Chancery Lane and Fetter Lane to reach Ludgate Circus by the London Wall . The road ahead is Ludgate Hill . The street numbering runs consecutively from west to east south @-@ side and then east to west north @-@ side . It links the Roman and medieval boundaries of the City after the latter was extended . The section of Fleet Street between Temple Bar and Fetter Lane is part of the A4 , a major road running west through London , although it once ran along the entire street and eastwards past St Paul 's Churchyard towards Cannon Street . 
 The nearest London Underground stations are Temple , Chancery Lane , and Blackfriars tube / mainline station and the City Thameslink railway station . London Bus routes 4 , 11 , 15 , 23 , 26 , 76 and 172 run along the full length of Fleet Street , while route 341 runs between Temple Bar and Fetter Lane . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early history = = = 
 Fleet Street was established as a thoroughfare in Roman London and there is evidence that a route led west from Ludgate by 200 AD . Local excavations revealed remains of a Roman amphitheatre near Ludgate on what was Fleet Prison , but other accounts suggest the area was too marshy for regular inhabitation by the Romans . The Saxons did not occupy the Roman city but established Lundenwic further west around what is now Aldwych and the Strand . 
 Many prelates lived around the street during the Middle Ages , including the Bishops of <unk> and St Davids and the Abbots of Faversham , Tewksbury , Winchcombe and Cirencester . Tanning of animal hides became established on Fleet Street owing to the nearby river , though this increased pollution leading to a ban on dumping rubbish by the mid @-@ 14th century . Many taverns and brothels were established along Fleet Street and have been documented as early as the 14th century . Records show that Geoffrey Chaucer was fined two shillings for attacking a friar in Fleet Street , though modern historians believe this is apocryphal . 
 An important landmark in Fleet Street during the late Middle Ages was a conduit that was the main water supply for the area . When Anne Boleyn was crowned Queen following her marriage to Henry VIII in 1533 , the conduit flowed wine instead of water . By the 16th century , Fleet Street , along with much of the City , was chronically overcrowded , and a Royal proclamation in 1580 banned any further building on the street . This had little effect , and construction continued , particularly timber . Prince Henry 's Room over the Inner Temple gate dates from 1610 and is named after Henry Frederick , Prince of Wales , eldest son of James I , who did not survive to succeed his father . 
 The eastern part of the street was destroyed by the Great Fire of London in 1666 , despite attempts to use the River Fleet to preserve it . Fire damage reached to about Fetter Lane , and the special tribunal of the ' Fire Courts ' was held at Clifford 's Inn , an inn of Chancery at the edge of the extent of the fire , to arbitrate on claimants ' rights . Properties were rebuilt in the same style as before the fire . During the early @-@ 18th century , a notorious upper @-@ class gang known as the <unk> operated on the street causing regular violence and vandalism . Mrs Salmon 's Waxworks was established at Prince Henry 's Room in 1711 . It had a display of macabre and black @-@ humoured exhibits , including the execution of Charles I ; a Roman lady , <unk> , whose father survived a sentence of starvation by sucking her breast ; and a woman who gave birth to 365 children simultaneously . The waxworks were a favourite haunt of William Hogarth , and survived into the 19th century . In 1763 , supporters of John Wilkes , who had been arrested for libel against the Earl of Bute , burned a <unk> in the centre of the street in protest against Bute . It led to violent demonstrations and rioting in 1769 and 1794 . 
 Tanning and other industries declined sharply after the River Fleet was routed underground in 1766 . The street was widened during the late @-@ 19th century , when Temple Bar was demolished and Ludgate Circus was constructed . The headquarters of the Anti @-@ Corn Law League were based at No. 67 Fleet Street , and a blue plaque marks the location . 
 = = = Printing and journalism = = = 
 Publishing started in Fleet Street around 1500 when William Caxton 's apprentice , Wynkyn de Worde , set up a printing shop near Shoe Lane , while at around the same time Richard Pynson set up as publisher and printer next to St. Dunstan 's church . More printers and publishers followed , mainly supplying the legal trade in the four Law Inns around the area , but also publishing books and plays . 
 In March 1702 , London 's first daily newspaper , the Daily Courant , was published in Fleet Street . It was followed by the Morning Chronicle . The publisher John Murray was founded at No. 32 Fleet Street in 1762 and remained there until 1812 , when it moved to Albemarle Street . The popularity of newspapers was restricted due to various taxes during the early 19th century , particularly Paper Duty . Peele 's Coffee @-@ House at No. 177 – 8 Fleet Street became popular and was the main committee room for the Society for <unk> the Paper Duty in 1858 . The society was successful and the duty was abolished in 1861 . Along with the repealing of the Newspaper Tax in 1855 , this led to a dramatic expansion of newspaper production in Fleet Street . The " penny press " ( newspapers costing one penny ) became popular during the 1880s and the initial number of titles had consolidated into a few nationally important ones . 
 By the 20th century , Fleet Street and its surrounding area was dominated by the national press and related industries . The Daily Express relocated to No. 121 – 8 Fleet Street in 1931 , into a building designed by Sir Owen Williams . It was the first curtain wall building in London , and survived the departure of the newspaper in 1989 and was restored in 2001 . The Daily Telegraph was based at No. 135 – 142 . These premises are both Grade II Listed . In the 1930s , No. 67 housed 25 separate publications ; by this time the majority of British households bought a daily paper produced from Fleet Street . 
 In 1986 , News International owner Rupert Murdoch caused controversy when he moved publication of The Times and The Sun away from Fleet Street to new premises in Wapping , East London . Murdoch believed it was impossible to produce a newspaper profitably on Fleet Street and the power of the print unions , the National Graphical Association ( NGA ) and the Society of Graphical and Allied Trades ( <unk> ) , was too strong ( an opinion endorsed by the Prime Minister , Margaret Thatcher ) . All Fleet Street print staff were sacked and new staff from the Electrical , Electronic , Telecommunications and Plumbing Union were brought in to operate the presses at Wapping using modern computer @-@ operated technology , rendering the power of the old unions obsolete . The resulting Wapping dispute featured violent protests at Fleet Street and Wapping that lasted over a year , but ultimately other publishers followed suit and moved out of Fleet Street towards Canary Wharf or Southwark . Reuters was the last major news outlet to leave Fleet Street in 2005 . The same year , The Daily Telegraph and Sunday Telegraph announced they were returning to the centre of London from Canary Wharf to new premises in Victoria in 2006 . 
 Some publishers have remained on Fleet Street . The London office of D.C. Thomson & Co . , creator of The Beano , is at No. 185 . The Secretariat of the Commonwealth Broadcasting Association is at No. 17 , as is Wentworth Publishing , an independent publisher of newsletters and courses . The Associated Press has an office in Fleet Street as did The Jewish Chronicle until 2013 when it moved to Golders Green . The British Association of Journalists is based at No. 89 while Metro International , publishers of the free newspaper Metro , are at No. 85 . 
 Though many prominent national newspapers have moved away from Fleet Street , the name is still synonymous with the printing and publishing industry . In the adjacent St. Brides Lane is the St Bride Library , holding a specialist collection relating to the type and print industry and providing courses in printing technology and methods . On the wall of Magpie Alley , off Bouverie Street , is a mural depicting the history of newspapers in the area .

 Despite the domination of the print industry , other businesses were also established on Fleet Street . The Automobile Association was established at No. 18 Fleet Street in 1905 . Since the post @-@ Wapping migration , Fleet Street is now more associated with the investment banking , legal and accountancy professions . For example , The Inns of Court and barristers ' chambers are down alleys and around courtyards off Fleet Street itself and many of the old newspaper offices have become the London headquarters for various companies ; e.g. Goldman Sachs is in the old Daily Telegraph and Liverpool Echo buildings of Peterborough Court and Mersey House . 
 C. Hoare & Co , England 's oldest privately owned bank , has been operating in Fleet Street since 1672 . Child & Co , now a wholly owned subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland , claims it is the oldest continuous banking establishment in the United Kingdom . It was founded in 1580 and has been based at No.1 Fleet Street , adjacent to Temple Bar , since 1673 . The law firm Freshfields moved to No. 65 Fleet Street in 1990 .

 In the High Middle Ages senior clergymen had their London palaces in the street . Place @-@ names surviving with this connection are Peterborough Court and Salisbury Court after their respective Bishops ' houses here ; apart from the Knights Templars ' establishment the Whitefriars monastery is recalled by Whitefriars Street and the remains of its undercroft have been preserved in a public display area . A Carmelite church was established on Fleet Street in 1253 , but it was destroyed during the Reformation in 1545 . 
 Today three churches serve the spiritual needs of the three ' communities ' associated with the area of the street . Temple Church was built by the Knights Templar in 1162 and serves the Legal profession . St Bride 's Church was established as early as the 6th century and was later designed by Sir Christopher Wren in a style the complemented St Mary Le Bow further east in the City . It remains the London church most associated with the print industry . St Dunstan @-@ in @-@ the @-@ West also dates from the 12th century supplements these as the local parish ( as opposed to guild church ) and is the London home for the Russian Orthodox church . 
 To the south lies an area of legal buildings known as the Temple , formerly the property of the Knights Templar , which at its core includes two of the four Inns of Court : the Inner Temple and the Middle Temple . There are many lawyers ' offices ( especially barristers ' chambers ) in the vicinity . To the west , at the junction with Strand are the Royal Courts of Justice whilst at the eastern end of the street the Old Bailey is near Ludgate Circus . 
 As a principal route leading to and from the City , Fleet Street was especially noted for its taverns and coffeehouses . Many notable persons of literary and political fame such as Samuel Johnson frequented these , and journalists would regularly meet in pubs to collect stories . Some , such as Ye Olde Cock Tavern at No. 22 and Ye Olde Cheshire Cheese at No. 145 , have survived to the 21st century and are Grade II listed . The El Vino 's wine bar moved to No. 47 in 1923 , quickly becoming popular with lawyers and journalists . Women were not allowed in the bar until 1982 , and then only because of a court order . 
 Since 1971 , the southern side of the street has been part of the Fleet Street Conservation Area , which ensures buildings are regularly maintained and the character of the street is preserved . The area expanded to the north side in 1981 .

At No. 72 is a bust of the Irish journalist and MP TP O 'Connor , constructed in 1934 by F. W. Doyle @-@ Jones . 
 On the southern side of the street nearby memorials and monuments include the Temple Bar . The current Temple Bar marker was designed by Sir Horace Jones in 1880 following the demolition of the older bar . In the Inner Temple Gardens is a memorial to Charles Lamb . In Salisbury Square there is an obelisk commemorating Robert <unk> , mayor of London between 1823 and 1833 , and a blue plaque commemorating the birthplace of diarist and naval secretary Samuel Pepys .

 Several writers and politicians are associated with Fleet Street , either as residents or regulars to the various taverns , including Ben Jonson , John Milton , Izaak Walton , John Dryden , Edmund Burke , Oliver Goldsmith and Charles Lamb . The lexicographer Samuel Johnson lived at Gough Square off Fleet Street between 1748 and 1759 ; the building has survived into the 21st century .

 The barber Sweeney Todd is traditionally said to have lived and worked in Fleet Street in the 18th century , where he would murder customers and serve their remains as pie fillings . An urban myth example of a serial killer , the character appears in various English language works starting in the mid @-@ 19th century . Adaptations of the story include the 1936 George King film , the 1979 Stephen Sondheim musical , and the 2007 Tim Burton film based on the musical , all titled Sweeney Todd : The Demon Barber of Fleet Street . 
 Fleet Street is mentioned in several of Charles Dickens ' works . The eponymous club in The Posthumous Papers of the Pickwick Club , more commonly known as The Pickwick Papers , is set in the street , as is <unk> 's Bank In A Tale of Two Cities . The poet John Davidson wrote two works in the late 19th century titled the Fleet Street Eclogues .

 = Battle of Bound Brook = 
 The Battle of Bound Brook ( April 13 , 1777 ) was a surprise attack conducted by British and Hessian forces against a Continental Army outpost at Bound Brook , New Jersey during the American Revolutionary War . The British objective of capturing the entire garrison was not met , although prisoners were taken . The American commander , Major General Benjamin Lincoln , left in great haste , abandoning papers and personal effects . 
 Late on the evening of April 12 , 1777 , four thousand British and Hessian troops under the command of Lieutenant General Charles Cornwallis marched from the British stronghold of New Brunswick . All but one detachment reached positions surrounding the outpost before the battle began near daybreak the next morning . During the battle , most of the 500 @-@ man garrison escaped by the unblocked route . American reinforcements arrived in the afternoon , but not before the British plundered the outpost and began the return march to New Brunswick .

 Following the Battles of Trenton and Princeton in December 1776 and January 1777 , the Continental Army of Major General George Washington entered winter quarters in Morristown , New Jersey , while the British and German forces of Lieutenant General William Howe settled into winter quarters in New York City and northeastern New Jersey . Throughout the winter months , a guerrilla war of sorts went on , in which American militia companies , sometimes with Continental Army support , harassed British and German outposts and ambushed their foraging and raiding expeditions . One of the forward bases used for these operations was at Bound Brook , located on the Raritan River upriver from New Brunswick , the major British camp in New Jersey . The post was responsible for patrolling three bridges across the Raritan likely to be used by the British in moves against the main camp at Morristown . 
 In February 1777 , the Bound Brook outpost consisted of 1 @,@ 000 men under the command of Major General Benjamin Lincoln , but this was reduced by expiring militia enlistments to 500 in mid @-@ March . The troops that remained were from the 8th Pennsylvania Regiment , a company from the 4th Continental Artillery , and two independent companies from the Wyoming Valley in what is now northeastern Pennsylvania , but was then also claimed by Connecticut as Westmoreland County . Lincoln expressed concern over his exposed position to General Washington , noting that many units were not in a position to " render the least assistance to this post in case it is attacked " , and that he was keeping wagons ready in case a precipitate departure was needed . Lieutenant General Lord Charles Cornwallis , in command of the British forces in New Jersey , had had enough of the ongoing petite guerre , and organized a reprisal action against the Bound Brook outpost . According to the Hessian jäger Captain Johann Ewald , Cornwallis asked him to draft a plan of attack in February , but the plan could not be executed until springtime because it necessitated fording the Raritan . On the night of April 12 , the plan was put into action . 
 = = Battle = = 
 Under the overall command of Cornwallis , 4 @,@ 000 British and Hessian troops marched from New Brunswick to make a multi @-@ pronged surprise attack . The right flank , under the command of Major General James Grant , consisted of the Hessian jäger corps , grenadiers from the English Brigade of Guards , and a detachment of British light dragoons . While most of this column advanced from Raritan Landing ( opposite New Brunswick on the left , or Bound Brook side , of the river ) , two companies of light infantry went further right , aiming to cut off the main road from Bound Brook to the Continental Army camp at Morristown . The center , under the command of Hessian Colonel Carl von Donop , consisted of the Hessian grenadier battalions von Linsing and <unk> , and the left , commanded by Cornwallis , consisted of two battalions of British light infantry , the 1st battalion of grenadiers , and another detachment of light dragoons . Donop 's column advanced up the right bank of the Raritan , aiming to gain control of the bridge directly at Bound Brook , while Cornwallis took a longer route to ford the river above Bound Brook and thus cut off the possibility of retreat in that direction . 
 Ewald and a few of his jägers were in the vanguard of Grant 's column and engaged the American sentries to the south of Bound Brook . Unaware that this was supposed to be a feint , Ewald drove the sentries back nearly to the main redoubt where the outpost 's cannons were located . By sunrise he was nearly surrounded ; the timely arrival of von Donop 's column just over the river , and the attack by Cornwallis 's column prompted the Americans to begin abandoning the post . The surprise was very nearly complete ; the Pennsylvania artillery company , which had been manning the redoubt , was severely mauled , with numerous killed and captured . Colonel von Donop reported that General Lincoln " must have retired en <unk> <unk> " ( " profoundly undressed " , or naked ) , and Lincoln 's papers were taken . The British plan was marred by the early skirmishing involving Ewald , and the too @-@ late arrival of the companies sent to cut off the road to Morristown ; Many Americans escaped via this route . The British captured also cannons , ammunition , and supplies , and looted Bound Brook , but returned to New Brunswick later that morning . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The Continental Army response was immediate ; Washington sent a large force under Major General Nathanael Greene to reoccupy Bound Brook . The British had already left by the time they arrived ; Greene sent a detachment to harass their rear guard . This detachment caught up with the British near Raritan Landing , where they killed 8 and captured 16 . 
 General Howe reported that about 30 Americans were killed and 80 to 90 were captured , while General Lincoln reported that 60 of his men were killed or wounded . Howe claimed no deaths and seven wounded among the British and Hessians . Washington reported that " [ t ] he enemy lost the post at Eleven O 'Clock the same day , & our people took possession of it again " , and that the army 's losses were " trifling and not worth mentioning " . He did , however , also report that between 35 and 40 killed or captured , and the loss of three field cannons . In a report to the Board of War , Washington admitted the capture of two cannons , two officers and 20 men from Colonel Proctor 's Regiment . General Greene reported to his wife , " The British Generals breakfasted and I [ dined ] at the same house that day " . 
 Washington , concerned that the attack presaged an early start to the campaign season , worried that his troops were not yet in place to deal with major British movements . Two weeks later , after no further major activity , the Americans learned that " the Enemy are to take the field the first of June . " 
 Washington recognized that Bound Brook itself was a difficult place to defend . On May 26 he withdrew the garrison , and on May 28 , he moved part of his army from Morristown to a new entrenched camp near Middle Brook , just north of Bound Brook but well protected between the first and second Watchung Mountain ranges ; other troops were stationed near Princeton . From the top of the Watchung Mountains Washington monitored British movements while the two sides continued to skirmish . Both sides also engaged in intelligence gathering , each trying to determine the strength and intentions of the other . 
 On June 12 Howe marched a significant force ( more than 18 @,@ 000 men ) out of New Brunswick , through Bound Brook , and as far as Somerset , apparently in an attempt to draw Washington out of the hills . Washington , aware that Howe had left the army 's heavy baggage behind , was not fooled and refused to move . Howe then abruptly retreated back to Piscataway on June 19 , upon which Washington had some of his troops give chase , and he moved down out of the hills . A week later Howe tried to spring a trap on one of Washington 's detachments that would have cut the American retreat into the hills off ; this effort was repulsed in the Battle of Short Hills . After this failure , Howe embarked his army on transports and set sail for Chesapeake Bay , intending to take Philadelphia from the south . 
 The battle site in Bound Brook is marked by signs and interpretive plaques . 
 = 2015 Liège – Bastogne – Liège = 
 The 2015 Liège – Bastogne – Liège was a one @-@ day cycling classic that took place in the Belgian Ardennes on 26 April 2015 . It was the 101st edition of the Liège – Bastogne – Liège one @-@ day cycling race and was the fourth cycling monument of the 2015 season . It was part of the 2015 UCI World Tour and was organised by the Amaury Sport Organisation ( ASO ) , who also organise the Tour de France . 
 200 riders raced over a 253 @-@ kilometre ( 157 mi ) route that started in Liège , travelled south to Bastogne , then returned north by an indirect route to finish in Ans on the outskirts of Liège . The route included many hills , especially in the final 70 kilometres ( 43 mi ) , which were the principal difficulty in the race . 
 There were many attacks in the final part of the race , with several groups breaking away from the peloton and subsequently being caught . A small group came together on the final ascent to the finish line , where the race was decided in a sprint . It was won by the pre @-@ race favourite , Alejandro Valverde ( Movistar Team ) , ahead of Julian Alaphilippe ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) and Joaquim Rodríguez ( Team Katusha ) . This was Valverde 's third victory in Liège – Bastogne – Liège and put him into the lead of the World Tour standings .

 Liège – Bastogne – Liège was established in 1892 and is one of the oldest races on the cycling calendar . Milano – Torino is the only current race to have begun earlier , although it did not exist as a regular event until the 1920s . Liège – Bastogne – Liège was founded as a precursor to a planned Liège – Paris – Liège event , which never came about , but eventually became one of the most important races on the cycling calendar in its own right . The race has come to be seen as one of the cycling Monuments , alongside Milan – San Remo , the Tour of Flanders , Paris – Roubaix and the Giro di Lombardia . Because Liège – Bastogne – Liège is the oldest of the major races on the cycling calendar , it has been given the nickname La <unk> ( English : The Old Lady ) . It is particularly known as a race where the best one @-@ day riders and the best Grand Tour riders can compete on relatively equal terms . In his book The Monuments , Peter Cossins wrote that Liège – Bastogne – Liège " is generally regarded as the toughest one @-@ day race on the calendar " . Eddy Merckx holds the record for the most victories : he won five times between 1969 and 1975 . 
 Liège – Bastogne – Liège was the fourth of the Monuments to take place in the 2015 season . Milan – San Remo and Paris – Roubaix has been won by John Degenkolb ( Giant – Alpecin ) , while the Tour of Flanders was won by Alexander Kristoff ( Team Katusha ) . Liège – Bastogne – Liège was the final event of the spring classics season and came as the conclusion to the Ardennes classics , following the Amstel Gold Race and La Flèche Wallonne . It was also part of the 2015 UCI World Tour , a season @-@ long competition that included both one @-@ day events and stage races . 
 = = Teams = = 
 As it is part of the UCI World Tour , the 17 UCI WorldTeams were automatically invited and obliged to send a team to Liège – Bastogne – Liège . The race organisers ( ASO , which also organises the Tour de France ) also made eight wildcard invitations to UCI Professional Continental teams . The peloton was therefore made up of 25 teams . Six of the teams were also invited to La Flèche Wallonne . These included two Belgian teams ( Wanty – Groupe Gobert and Topsport Vlaanderen – Baloise ) , two French teams ( Cofidis and Team Europcar ) , Team Roompot and MTN – Qhubeka . The final two teams to be invited to Liège – Bastogne – Liège were Bora – Argon 18 ( whose invitation meant that they would participate in all five Monuments in 2015 ) and Cult Energy Pro Cycling . As each team was required to enter between five and eight riders , the maximum size of the peloton was 200 riders . 
 = = Route = = 
 The route for the 2015 race was announced on 15 April . The route was 10 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) shorter than in 2014 ; it was therefore 253 kilometres ( 157 mi ) in length . The changes came in the final section of the route , with the Côte de la <unk> removed and the Col du Rosier and the Col du Maquisard added instead . The second change was a reduction in distance between the third @-@ last and second @-@ last climbs : the distance was cut from 25 kilometres ( 16 mi ) to 16 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 9 mi ) , with a small unclassified climb also added . Cyclingnews.com described the first change as a " much harder combination " suggested that the new route would make the race more interesting than the 2014 edition , which it described as " painfully dull " . 
 The race began in Liège , in Place Saint @-@ Lambert outside the Prince @-@ Bishops ' Palace , with a neutral zone that took the riders out of the town to the south . The first 75 kilometres ( 47 mi ) of the race brought the peloton south , through <unk> to La Roche @-@ en @-@ Ardenne ; although the roads were not flat there were no difficult or categorised climbs . Here the riders encountered the first classified climb of the day , the Côte de la Roche @-@ en @-@ Ardenne ( 2 @.@ 8 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 7 mi ) at an average gradient of 6 @.@ 2 % ) . After reaching the summit , the riders continued south for another 28 kilometres ( 17 mi ) . This took them through <unk> to Bastogne , which they reached after 107 kilometres ( 66 mi ) of racing . This was the turning @-@ point : from here the route turned to the north to return towards Liège . The northern leg of the race was both longer – 146 kilometres ( 91 mi ) – and more difficult – it included nine categorised climbs . 
 After turning around at the Rond @-@ point La <unk> ( named after the race itself ) , the peloton left Bastogne to the north @-@ east . The first 17 kilometres ( 11 mi ) were fairly flat and took the riders to Houffalize . After a fast descent came the Côte de Saint @-@ Roch ( 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) at 11 @.@ 2 % ) . Another fairly flat section followed : the route continued north for approximately 30 kilometres ( 19 mi ) on fairly major roads through <unk> and <unk> . At this point , with 86 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 53 @.@ 7 mi ) to the finish line , there were still eight categorised climbs remaining . 
 The first three of these climbs came in quick succession . These were the Côte de Wanne ( 2 @.@ 7 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 7 mi ) at 7 @.@ 4 % ) , the Côte de Stockeu ( 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) at 12 @.@ 5 % ) and the Côte de la Haute @-@ Levée ( 3 @.@ 6 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 2 mi ) at 5 @.@ 6 % ) . The Côte de Wanne was narrow and badly surfaced , with a dangerous descent following . The Côte de Stockeu was described by Cycling Weekly as a " killer climb " , because of its steep gradient , its narrowness and its poor road surface . The Côte de la Haute @-@ Levée was unique on the course because it included a 500 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) section of cobblestones . 
 These climbs brought the riders to Stavelot . Soon afterwards , there was a hairpin turn that took them towards the two climbs new to the 2015 edition . The first of these was the Col du Rosier ( 4 @.@ 4 kilometres ( 2 @.@ 7 mi ) at 5 @.@ 9 % ) , which was the longest climb of the day . The riders then descended through the town of Spa and turned west onto the Col du Maquisard ( 2 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 6 mi ) at 5 % ) , which they crossed with 46 kilometres ( 29 mi ) to the finish line . The route then crossed over the roads used for the southern leg as the riders entered the final section of the race . 
 The following climb was Côte de La Redoute ( 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) at 8 @.@ 9 % ) , with 34 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 21 @.@ 4 mi ) from the summit to the finish line . Cyclingnews.com described La Redoute as " the most emblematic climb of the entire race " . It had an uneven gradient : the first 1 kilometre ( 0 @.@ 62 mi ) was at about 8 % , before 500 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) at around 13 % and another 500 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) at 6 % . The riders descended down twisting roads , crossed over the uncategorised Côte de <unk> , before coming to the penultimate climb , the Côte de la Roche @-@ aux @-@ Faucons ( 1 @.@ 5 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 93 mi ) at 9 @.@ 4 % ) with 19 kilometres ( 12 mi ) to the finish line . This was one of the most difficult climbs of the race , with frequent changes of gradient and a poor road surface . There was then another uncategorised climb and a steep descent into the outskirts of Liège . 
 The final climb of the day came with 6 @.@ 2 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 9 mi ) remaining . This was the Côte de Saint @-@ Nicolas ( 1 @.@ 2 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 75 mi ) at 8 @.@ 6 % ) . Cycling Weekly described it as " a succession of steep corners with nothing between " . After the descent from the climb , the riders entered Ans , the finishing town . There was a long , straight road that started 2 kilometres ( 1 @.@ 2 mi ) from the finish line . After 500 metres ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) of flat , the road climbed towards the finish at around 5 % . With around 300 metres ( 980 ft ) to go , there was a left @-@ hand turn that took the riders to the finish line . 
 = = Pre @-@ race favourites = = 
 Recent editions of Liège – Bastogne – Liège had been won in several different ways . Andy Schleck ( then riding for Team Saxo Bank ) had won a solo victory with a long @-@ distance attack in 2009 , while Dan Martin ( Cannondale – Garmin ) had attacked late on to win in 2013 . The 2010 edition was won by a two @-@ man breakaway and the 2011 edition by a three @-@ man group . The defending champion , Simon Gerrans ( Orica – GreenEDGE ) won the 2014 edition in a bunch sprint after a large group came to Ans together . The pattern of the 2015 edition was therefore hard to predict . One consistent pattern , however , was that recent editions of the race had been won by major names rather than by outsiders . 
 Alejandro Valverde ( Movistar Team ) had won La Flèche Wallonne during the week that preceded Liège – Bastogne – Liège and he was one of the major favourites to take the victory . Valverde had won the race on two previous occasions ( in 2006 and 2008 ) and had also been on the podium on four other occasions . Valverde 's status as the major favourite had the potential to work against him , however , as other riders were expected to mark him closely and perhaps prevent him from winning . Philippe Gilbert ( BMC Racing Team ) had suffered from this problem in the Amstel Gold Race . 
 The other major favourite for the race was the reigning world champion , Michał Kwiatkowski ( Etixx – Quick @-@ Step ) . Kwiatkowski had finished third in the 2014 Liège – Bastogne – Liège and had already won the Amstel Gold Race in 2015 . Although he had not been as strong as had been expected in La Flèche Wallonne , the longer climbs of Liège – Bastogne – Liège were expected to suit him better . 
 Other favourites included Joaquim Rodríguez ( Katusha ) , Rui Costa ( Lampre – Merida ) and Dan Martin , as well as Vincenzo Nibali ( Astana ) and Tim Wellens ( Lotto – Soudal ) . Simon Gerrans had suffered an injury earlier in the season and had not fully recovered ; he was not expected to be able to defend his title . Similarly , Philippe Gilbert had suffered a fall in La Flèche Wallonne ; he was also not as well suited to the route of Liège – Bastogne – Liège as he was to the other Ardennes classics .

 The race began with hard racing for the first hour until the day 's main breakaway was formed , with around 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) raced . The breakaway involved eight riders . These were Diego Ulissi ( Lampre – Merida ) , Matteo Montaguti ( AG2R La Mondiale ) , Otto <unk> ( Topsport Vlaanderen – Baloise ) , Clément Chevrier ( IAM Cycling ) , Marco <unk> ( Wanty – Groupe Gobert ) , Anthony Turgis ( Cofidis ) , Cesare Benedetti ( Bora – Argon 18 ) and Rasmus Quaade ( Cult Energy Pro Cycling ) . The group 's lead soon extended to nearly eight minutes , while the peloton was led by Team Europcar . Europcar 's work reduced the breakaway 's lead by around three minutes by the time of the Côte de La Roche @-@ en @-@ Ardenne , 79 kilometres ( 49 mi ) into the race . 
 After the turn in Bastogne , the breakaway continued . It was , however , reduced in numbers , as Quaade , Chevrier and <unk> all fell back before the peloton reached the Côte de Wanne , four hours into the race . Katusha led the peloton as it approached the climb . On the climb itself , Astana came to the front of the peloton and led the chase , with the breakaway 's lead reduced to under a minute . On the Côte de Stockeu , Andriy <unk> ( Astana ) , Gorka Izagirre ( Movistar ) and Simon Yates ( Orica – GreenEDGE ) attacked and joined the lead group ; more riders then bridged across to form a 21 @-@ man group . This included five Astana riders , though not Nibali . On the Côte de la Haute @-@ Levée , several riders attacked again to form a smaller breakaway ; these were <unk> <unk> and Michele Scarponi ( both Astana ) , Manuele Boaro ( Tinkoff – Saxo ) , Esteban Chaves ( Orica @-@ GreenEDGE ) and Julián Arredondo ( Trek Factory Racing ) . They had a 25 @-@ second lead at the summit and , although Boaro and Arredondo were dropped on the Col du Rosier , this increased to more than a minute for a short while . It was reduced to 45 seconds on the Col du Maquisard , however , as Movistar worked hard in the peloton to bring them back . 
 As the peloton approached the Côte de la Redoute , there was a large crash . Among the riders to crash were two previous winners of the race , Dan Martin and Simon Gerrans , as well as Fränk Schleck ( Trek Factory Racing ) , Nicolas Roche ( Sky ) , Mathias Frank ( IAM ) and Yukiya Arashiro ( Europcar ) . Vincenzo Nibali was forced to <unk> himself from his bike , but avoided crashing . The peloton was reduced to around 40 riders at the foot of the climb . Although there were no bad injuries in the crash , Roche and Arashiro took some time to stand up , with Roche looking particularly dazed . Many of the riders who crashed attempted to get back into the peloton , with Gerrans and Martin among them . Gerrans was forced to abandon the race shortly afterwards after he crashed for a second time . 
 On the Col de la Redoute itself , <unk> was dropped from the breakaway ; Scarponi and Chaves had a 35 @-@ second lead at the summit and were caught around 10 kilometres ( 6 mi ) later . The riders then entered the Côte de la Roche @-@ aux @-@ Faucons , where Roman Kreuziger ( Tinkoff @-@ Saxo ) and Giampaolo Caruso ( Katusha ) attacked ; they were quickly joined by Jakob Fuglsang ( Astana ) and had an 18 @-@ second lead at the summit . Several riders attempted to form chase groups ; eventually a six @-@ man chase group was formed by Giovanni Visconti ( Movistar ) , Julian Alaphilippe ( Etixx @-@ Quick Step ) , Rui Costa ( Lampre @-@ Merida ) , Samuel Sánchez ( BMC Racing Team ) and Daniel Moreno ( Katusha ) . They stayed away for a short while and were then joined by around 20 other riders with 15 kilometres ( 9 mi ) remaining as rain began to fall . 
 Zdeněk Štybar ( Etixx @-@ Quick Step ) took over the pace @-@ setting in the peloton as it approached the Côte de Saint @-@ Nicolas and he reduced the gap to Kreuziger , Caruso and Fuglsang . On the climb , Valverde came to the front of the group to control the pace . Nibali then attacked and , while he was not able to escape the group , several riders were dropped . These included Michał Kwiatkowski and Philippe Gilbert . Nibali 's attack also brought the chasing group back to the leaders . The next attack came from Romain Bardet ( AG2R La Mondiale ) on the descent from the Côte de Saint @-@ Nicolas . While he too was unable to break away from the group , his attack did cause Nibali to lose contact and reduced the group to ten riders . 
 Giampaolo Caruso led the group into Ans and towards the climb to the finish . At the foot of the climb , Daniel Moreno , Caruso 's teammate , attacked and built a small gap ahead of the group . The group did not initially chase him , as all the other riders looked for Valverde to do the work . Eventually Valverde did start to chase Moreno and caught him at the final bend . He opened his sprint from a long way out , with Joaquim Rodríguez ( Katusha ) right behind him . Rodríguez slowed as they approached the line , however , and Valverde took the victory . Julian Alaphilippe came around Rodríguez in the final metres to take second place .

 Valverde 's win was the third victory at Liège – Bastogne – Liège in his career . He became one of only six riders to have three or more victories in the race . Liège – Bastogne – Liège also concluded a very successful Ardennes week for him : he had two victories and one second @-@ place finish in the three races . Valverde was the first rider since Philippe Gilbert in 2011 to win both La Flèche Wallonne and Liège – Bastogne – Liège in the same week and , although he was one place away from imitating Gilbert 's Ardennes triple , he described it as a " great week " . 
 Alaphilippe 's second @-@ place finish was the best for any French rider since Laurent Jalabert in 1998 . He had entered the race in support of Kwiatkowski . When Kwiatkowski was struggling on the Côte de Saint @-@ Nicolas , the Etixx @-@ Quick Step directeur sportif sent a radio message to Alaphilippe to ride for himself ; this was similar to the events in La Flèche Wallonne , where Alaphilippe also finished second to Valverde . He was frustrated on the finish line and waved his arm in the air ; he said after the race " today I really felt I could have done something more " . Cyclingnews.com suggested after the race that he had the potential to win a Monument in the future . 
 Several riders were injured in the crash 40 kilometres ( 25 mi ) from the finish . The worst @-@ affected was Yukiya Arashiro , who suffered several broken bones . Gianluca Brambilla ( Etixx @-@ Quick Step ) broke his collarbone . LottoNL – Jumbo had two riders with injuries : Paul Martens broke his hand and Bram <unk> suffered from concussion and bruises . Nicolas Roche and Simon Gerrans both suffered some discomfort after their crashes , but neither had significant injuries . Dan Martin rode the Tour de Romandie the following week . After he suffered with his breathing through the race , he discovered that he had broken two ribs in the crash in Liège – Bastogne – Liège .

 Skinny Jeanz and a Mic was the debut studio album by jerkin ' crew and rap duo New Boyz , Legacy and Ben J. It was released on September 15 , 2009 , via <unk> Music , Asylum Records and Warner Bros. Records . The album was heavily influenced by jerkin ' music . It received generally positive reviews , being called the sixth best album of 2009 by The New York Times . The album was released after the duo brought jerkin ' to national attention with their viral hit " You 're a Jerk " , which later became a commercial success and the first single off their album . The second single " Tie Me Down " , featuring Ray J , was released and also was successful . The album debuted at fifty @-@ six on the Billboard 200 , and at number twelve on Top R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Albums and eight on Top Rap Albums . The album was produced by New Boyz member , Legacy , and also contributions from producers , Jay @-@ Nari , D & D and DJ <unk> Fel .

 The album was originally scheduled for release , August 18 , 2009 , but plans were changed for unknown reasons . Legacy received main production credits on the album . In an interview with Format Magazine he said , " I started making beats because I didn ’ t want everybody else ’ s sound . We wanted our own sound . So , I had no choice but to make my own beats to get that sound . " In an interview with Ozone Magazine , when asked about their music and the revival of the " newer west " movement , Ben J stated , " Everything is becoming positive out here . People are growing out of that old mentality . Rapping about gangs ain ’ t really what it ’ s about out here now . Everybody is having fun . " In the same interview , Legacy said , " I think music like ours is coming from people being tired of the same ol ’ thing . People thought they had to bang to be the cool kid but now the smart kid is the cool kid . People being creative are the people coming up right now . " 
 In an interview with HipHopDX , Legacy said the album was , " [ It ’ s ] pretty much like the lifestyle and the culture of the typical California teenager put in [ to ] music . It ’ s going to surprise a lot of people , because a lot of people think we just make the jerk songs [ and ] dance music . " According to Legacy , only two tracks on the album are jerking songs . He also stated that the album is about a lot of different topics , and was quick to point out that most of them were pre- " Jerk " stating they were fifteen songs in before ' You 're a Jerk ' . Most of the producers on the album were mostly unknown , local producers . Legacy said , " We have no big producers on our album . All of our producers are like kids our age . Everything compliments each other , because the style and the music are so new to the game . "

 Many critics noted Several songs are built on the same formula of " You 're a Jerk " , with Allmusic noting that , " Dot Com , " " Colors , " " <unk> , " and " So Dope " ( which the chorus is a sound bite from the 1992 film Class Act ) all have the cheesy drum machines , samples , and off @-@ kilter lyric approach that make " Jerk " so good . The review also said " R & B ballad " Tie Me Down " featuring smooth Auto @-@ tuned vocals from Ray J , the <unk> " <unk> " , the slow jam " New Girl , " and the rollicking " Cashmere , " which bumps along like a New Jack rap jam , are nice diversions . " On the album split , The Los Angeles Times said , " The album begins to lose circulation toward its end , when the pair lose their <unk> wit in favor of mawkish lover @-@ boy ballads better left to Sean Kingston albums . " Jeff Weiss of the newspaper used " Tie Me Down " as an example , noting that its sounds have " a saccharine sappiness and contrived tone that feels at odds with the otherwise organic @-@ sounding album . " 
 Some points of the work were inspired by Pharrell Williams , Kanye West , and other " hip @-@ hop style eccentrics " . The songs on the album have heavy lyrical underlies , noted by several critics . The comic @-@ esque " Way 2 Many <unk> " described as talking about " a string of almost @-@ conquests better left <unk> " : " Chick had a cold sore that looked like John McCain . " On " Cashmere " , Ben J and Legacy " try to outdo each other to win the attention of a young woman , but , predictably , she spurns them both " . The lyrics also cover their difference in style , as seen in " <unk> " , as Legacy raps , " Jeans stay skinny like I starve my fabric , Another damn thing / You ’ ll never see me care about another man ’ s jeans . " Jon Caramanica of The New York Times responded , " Baggy has been de rigueur in hip @-@ hop for so long it ’ s easy to forget that 25 years ago , rappers gladly wore tight denim . Now it ’ s cause for a fight . " Some of the lyrics use double entendre , with the duo referring to themselves as " rejects " and " jerks " on " Dot Com " , which The Los Angeles Times called " both a double @-@ entendre for the dance moves spurring the craze , and illustrative of their generation ’ s reclamation of formerly nerdy archetypes .

 Tim Sendra of Allmusic gave the album three out of five stars review , and said the album had the " cheesy drum machines , samples , and off @-@ kilter lyric approach that make " Jerk " so good " , " the duo stick to the template [ of " Jerk " ] , considering the uniqueness of the sound they 've created and also the fact that it 's a debut record made by teenagers , and an impressive and unfailingly fun debut at that . " The review goes on to point out that " the reliance on the " Jerk " sound can be a little monotonous , there are enough variations along the way to keep things interesting . " He also says " The duo 's flow is not incredible but they spit convincingly . If you were looking for <unk> pop @-@ rap with a fresh sound and a light lyrical touch , the New Boyz debut is a fine destination . " XXL said that the album delivered " unexpected lyrical talent " but that it lacked " sonic variety " . The review also goes on to say that the album " is no hip @-@ hop classic , but rather the breath of fresh air rap needs . " Jeff Weiss of The Los Angeles Times gave the album three stars , commenting that the album " is a catchy and charismatic debut that should engender pleasant teen nostalgia in anyone old enough to vote and help explain why for the last six months , the kids have been saying out with the old , in with the New Boyz . " . The review also said that the album " successfully strikes a balance between introducing a new sound ( the minimalist bass @-@ heavy bounce of jerk music ) and style ( skinny jeans , Vans and " colors that ain ’ t even on the rainbow " ) , with traditional teenage themes ( girls , the desire for self @-@ expression , adults who don ’ t understand , girls ) . The result is a West Coast antidote to the South ’ s veritable monopoly on homeroom rap — a relentlessly breezy and fun ride through the lives of a pair of class clowns bent on enjoying the face cards that fate dealt . " The Selby Times said that the album " is about as happening as it gets for teenage music with an attitude , even if it makes adults ' eyes roll in disgust . " Wendy Roby of BBC said that , " But overall their sheer chutzpah wins you over – and with its day @-@ glo tongue wedged so very firmly in its cheek , Skinny Jeanz and a Mic is hard to resist . " Jon Caramanica of The New York Times called the album " one of the year ’ s most charming rap debuts , and certainly the least expected . " In a separate review , he named the album the sixth best album of the year , commenting , " Emerging from Southern California ’ s jerk scene , this teenage duo made an album that ’ s appealingly young , simultaneously wide @-@ eyed and knowingly lewd . " <unk> 's Nathan Slavik was less positive , predicting that the album would be " the last time we hear from the New Boyz . "

 = = Plot = = 
 Mr. Burns falls ill with <unk> ( a fictional condition in which the body naturally runs out of blood , though it is akin to a real condition called hypovolemia ) and needs a blood transfusion . His blood type , double O negative , is very rare , however , and none of the employees at Springfield Nuclear Power Plant have it . Homer discovers that Bart has double O negative blood and urges his son to donate , promising that he will be handsomely rewarded . Bart reluctantly agrees and his blood donation saves Mr. Burns ' life . Burns is rejuvenated by the blood and he sends the Simpson family a thank you card . Enraged at Burns ' paltry gesture , Homer writes an insulting reply , but Marge convinces him at the last minute not to send it . The next morning , Homer discovers that the letter is gone as Bart has mailed it . 
 Bart explains that he knew Homer would probably change his mind , and decided to send the letter before that could happen . Homer desperately tries to prevent the letter from reaching Burns , but fails . Mr. Burns becomes furious and demands that Homer be beaten . However , Mr. Smithers calls off the beating on the grounds that that is no way to thank the man who saved Mr. Burns 's life . Smithers convinces Burns to instead reward the Simpson family . The Simpsons receive an antique Xtapolapocetl , an Olmec head ( a massive , Tiki @-@ god @-@ like affair ) that Bart , the blood donor , likes , and which Homer hates . 
 At the end , as the family stare at the head , the Simpsons debate on what the moral of this whole story is . It cannot be ' A good deed is its own reward ' as Bart got a reward he likes , but at the same time it is not ' No good deed goes unrewarded ' as they never would have received anything if Homer had not written the angry letter . Homer decides that there is not a lesson to be learned from this , as it 's " just a bunch of stuff that happened " . 
 = = Production = = 
 " Blood Feud " was written by George Meyer and directed by David Silverman . Executive producer Sam Simon and writers Al Jean and Mike Reiss came up with the idea for the episode while they were trying to fill up the rest of the production run . A co @-@ worker had recently needed a blood transfusion , and the writers thought it would be funny if Mr. Burns had one . Although Meyer was credited with writing the episode , Jean and Reiss re @-@ wrote and polished the script . Harry Shearer , the voice of Mr. Burns and Smithers , could not attend the table read for the episode , so his parts were read by Dan Castellaneta ( the voice of Homer ) . " Blood Feud " includes a first act that is much longer than a normal episode of the show . The producers were going to end the act with Mr. Burns feeling better , but decided to extend it to show how the Simpson family was affected . " Blood Feud " ends with the family discussing what the message of the episode was , but decide that there was no message . The writers were having trouble conceiving an ending , but decided that since there was no point , they would discuss it . In his book Planet Simpson , Chris Turner writes that the ending is meant to openly mock the " notion of the tidy sitcom @-@ style moral " and the " formulaic plots of sitcoms " . 
 David Silverman describes the episode as " one of my very favorite episodes that I had the pleasure to direct " . He notes that several " standard <unk> " appear for the first time in the episode , such as Homer 's conversations with his brain and his high @-@ pitched " fairy voice " . Silverman inserted a red herring into the episode in a scene where Mr. Burns says that he was rejuvenated . Silverman used a close @-@ up of Burns when he says " blood of a young boy " in hopes of misleading viewers into thinking that the rest of episode would be about Burns seeking more of Bart 's blood . 
 The episode includes the debut of the Olmec head Xtapolapocetl . After the episode , it was moved into the Simpsons ' basement , where it has since reappeared as a prop in the background of several episodes , although never in a major role . The design was partially based on real Olmec heads , but changed to look more interesting and grotesque . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The composition and setting of the scene where Smithers and Dr. Hibbert discuss Mr. Burns ' health is partially inspired by a scene from Citizen Kane where Kane talks to his wife Susan Alexander after she attempts suicide . Otto is heard humming " Iron Man " by Black Sabbath . The ghostwriter Mr. Burns hires mentions that he wrote " Like Hell I Can 't " . The title is a play on Sammy Davis , Jr . ' s autobiography Yes , I Can . Homer <unk> the story of " Androcles and the Lion " , instead referring to it as " Hercules and the Lion " . A mural in the post office resembles Michelangelo 's The Creation of Adam . Burns 's line about getting " A <unk> , <unk> , zip @-@ <unk> @-@ <unk> present " is similar to lines used in Dr. Seuss books . The scene where Homer dictates the angry letter to Mr. Burns , and the scene where he and Bart attempt to get it out of the mailbox , are inspired by the Honeymooners episode " Letter to the Boss " .

 The episode has received positive reviews from television critics . The authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , wrote , " One of those shows that people always talk about when discussing The Simpsons – and rightfully so . Homer 's transformation from angry parent to sensible , calm husband is excellent , as is his reaction to Bart posting his angry letter . Their attempts to retrieve the letter and Burns ' eventual reaction are fabulous . " DVD Movie Guide 's Colin Jacobson wrote : " In many ways , " Feud " seemed more derivative than usual . Not only did it resemble parts of " Two Cars in Every Garage and Three Eyes on Every Fish " , but Homer ’ s attempts to regain the letter before Burns reads it appear reminiscent of an episode of The Flintstones . Despite those similarities , " Feud " still provided a very entertaining show . The program packed in a slew of hilarious moments , from Homer ’ s description of a Bible story to his visit to the post office . " A reviewer for <unk> gave the episode a grade of C , describing it as " a fun episode , but far from great . " Ben Rayner of The Toronto Star included " Blood Feud " in his list of the top ten episodes of The Simpsons , noting that " Homer 's efforts to thwart the mail service still kill me 15 years later .

 The 2010 Toyota / Save Mart 350 was a NASCAR Sprint Cup Series stock car race held on June 20 , 2010 , at Infineon Raceway in Sonoma , California . Contested over 110 laps , it was the sixteenth race of the 2010 Sprint Cup Series season and the first of two road course competitions on the schedule . The race was won by Jimmie Johnson , for the Hendrick Motorsports team . Robby Gordon finished second , and Kevin Harvick , who started fourth , clinched third . 
 Conditions were sunny at the start of the race , making the track potentially slippery . Pole position driver Kasey Kahne maintained his lead into the first corner , but Johnson , who had started in the second position on the grid , took the lead before the first lap was over . Kahne suffered an ill @-@ handling car during the beginning of the race , causing him to fall to seventh by the sixth lap . Seven laps before the finish , race leader Marcos Ambrose , turned his car off to try to save fuel , but he could not refire the engine and subsequently stalled . He dropped back from the lead to sixth place with seven laps remaining , allowing Kahne to finish fourth and Jeff Gordon fifth . 
 There were eight cautions and twelve lead changes among eight different drivers throughout the course of the race , Johnson 's fourth win of the season and his first ever at Infineon . The result moved him up four spots to second in the Drivers ' Championship , 140 points behind of leader Kevin Harvick and one ahead of Kyle Busch . Chevrolet maintained its lead in the Manufacturers ' Championship , nine points ahead of Toyota and forty @-@ three ahead of Dodge , with twenty races remaining in the season .

 Infineon Raceway is one of two road courses to hold NASCAR races , the other being Watkins Glen International . The standard road course at Infineon Raceway is a 12 @-@ turn course that is 2 @.@ 52 miles ( 4 @.@ 06 km ) long ; the track was modified in 1998 , adding the Chute , which bypassed turns 5 and 6 , shortening the course to 1 @.@ 95 miles ( 3 @.@ 14 km ) . The Chute was only used for NASCAR events such as this race , and was criticized by many drivers , who preferred the full layout .

 The race , the sixteenth out of a total of thirty @-@ six in the season , began at 3 pm EDT and was televised live in the United States on TNT . Conditions were sunny with a high of 80 ° F ( 27 ° C ) , making the track potentially slippery . Infineon Raceway volunteer coordinator Tim <unk> began the pre @-@ race ceremonies by giving the invocation . Next , CNN news anchor Robin Meade performed the national anthem , and former NFL running back Roger Craig and Northern California Toyota Dealer Association 's Henry Hansel gave the command for drivers to start their engines . On the pace laps , Sam Hornish , Jr. and David Ragan had to go to the rear of the starting grid because they switched to back @-@ up cars due to accidents during practice and qualifying . 
 Kasey Kahne held the lead going through the first corner with Jimmie Johnson behind him . Going through turn seven , Kurt Busch went three @-@ wide with Kahne and Johnson for the lead , and Kahne slowed as Johnson claimed the lead . Kahne 's vacated third position was filled by Kevin Harvick . Marcos Ambrose moved into fifth , passing Jeff Gordon on the sixth lap . After starting in the pole position , Kahne lost six positions in the first seven laps . Johnson continued to increase his lead over Kurt Busch to 3 @.@ 17 seconds . On lap 11 , the first caution flag was waved for an accident involving Clint Bowyer , A. J. Allmendinger , Kyle Busch , and Jamie McMurray . Four laps later , some teams decided to pit as Kyle Busch went to the garage for repairs . Johnson made a good restart , retaining the first position as Ambrose passed Kurt Busch for the second position . 
 Tony Stewart also improved his position by passing Harvick for fourth when McMurray spun out on the restart . Johnson built a lead of one second over Ambrose within two laps of the restart . On lap 17 , Jeff Gordon improved his position to sixth after passing Martin Truex , Jr . , and Johnson continued to pull away with a three @-@ second lead after lap 21 . On lap 23 , Denny Hamlin reported that he was struggling due to damage on the hood of his race car . A lap later , Biffle passed Ryan Newman for ninth while Jeff Gordon emerged in third after passing Juan Pablo Montoya and Kurt Busch . On lap 27 , green flag pit stops began when Ambrose came to pit road for fuel and four new tires . A few laps later , Bobby Labonte received a drive @-@ through penalty for exiting pit road too fast . 
 On lap 35 , Johnson went to pit road and received four new tires and fuel , allowing Stewart to claim the lead . Debutant Mattias Ekström gained the lead as Stewart went to pit lane . On lap 44 , Hamlin continued to have trouble ; his hood began to cover his windshield under green flag conditions . Johnson soon built a 1 @.@ 58 second lead over second place Ambrose . Hamlin was then given a drive @-@ through penalty for speeding on pit road . On lap 52 , Ambrose made a pit stop because of his team 's three pit stop strategy . 
 Johnson 's lead — 13 seconds over Truex , Jr. by lap 54 — was reduced to nothing when the safety car was deployed on the fifty @-@ eighth lap . Dave Blaney had spun out and his car stopped in the middle of the track . After pit stops were completed , the top five positions were filled by Boris Said in first , Stewart in second , Ambrose in third , Ekström in fourth , and David Ragan in fifth . Said made a good restart , but because of his older tires , Ambrose passed him . One lap later , Johnson had all ready passed four cars and was in the third position when Truex Jr. spun going through turn eleven . The third caution flag was waved because Brad Keselowski turned sideways at turn ten ; he had major damage to the splitter from going through the dirt off the track . Said made a slow restart , making cars collide with each other , prompting a red flag on lap 67 . 
 After twenty @-@ two minutes , drivers restarted their engines as cleanup crews were still working . Ambrose made a good restart on lap 70 to keep Johnson behind him . Six laps later , Stewart went to pit lane as Johnson was catching Ambrose . On lap 79 , Johnson went to pit lane for fuel and four new tires ; he was scored in seventeenth afterward . On the following lap , Ambrose went to pit lane for new tires and fuel , so Bowyer became the leader . Elliott Sadler and Boris Said both held the lead during the pit stops . The fifth caution flag came out on lap 85 because Montoya and Joey Logano collided . Boris Said led the field on the restart , but he went off track in turn two and fell to the fifth position as Ambrose , Johnson , Robby Gordon and Biffle passed him . Shortly after the restart , the sixth caution came out because Ekström and David Gilliland both spun out . Ambrose made a good restart to maintain the first position , while Johnson defended second . 
 On lap 100 , Bowyer and Sadler both spun sideways because Jeff Gordon collided with them . Three laps later , the seventh caution came out because Keselowski had fluid coming out of his race car after being spun around by Gilliland . Under caution , Ambrose in the first turn stopped his car to save fuel in case of green @-@ white @-@ checkered finishes and came to a stop going up a hill ; he lost six positions and went back to the lead under caution thinking that that was where he was to be on the restart . However NASCAR ruled soon afterwards that Ambrose failed to maintain any speed under caution by stalling his car and ordered Ambrose to go back to 7th place on the restart costing Ambrose a chance at his first <unk> victory . Ambrose obeyed and slowed his lead to 7th place and Johnson restarted well to take the lead from Robby Gordon . On the final lap ( 110 ) , Matt Kenseth spun and collided with the tire barriers after his brakes failed . Johnson crossed the finish line in first to take his fourth win of the season and his first ever at a road course . Robby Gordon followed in second , ahead of Harvick in third , Kahne in fourth , and Jeff Gordon in fifth . The race had a total of eight cautions and twelve lead changes among eight different drivers .

 Jimmie Johnson appeared in victory lane after his victory lap to start celebrating his fourth win of the season , and his first on a road course . Before the race , he had stated , “ I have a lot of confidence but at the same time , after eight years of trying , I ’ m hopeful we have overturned a stone that we have missed in the past . I don ’ t think we have forgotten any area or missed something , but we ’ ll go out and give it a shot and see what we can do and I am ready mentally , physically and we did some testing . I think we found a couple of small things that will bring speed to the cars . ” Following his win , he added , " This win is important , but it ’ s not what it ’ s going to take to win a championship . " 
 Although Marcos Ambrose was leading near the end of the race , he stalled his car while going uphill when coasting in order to conserve fuel . NASCAR ruled that he had failed to maintain reasonable speed under the caution which caused him to drop to seventh . In the subsequent press conference , Johnson said , " I feel bad for him . It was definitely a gift kind of handed to us . " Johnson expressed his enjoyment of winning the race , but he also stated : 
 " Normally , you shut off the car downhill to save fuel . I don ’ t think you do that going up the hill — that ’ s the last place to do it . I thought he was out of fuel , or it was electrical . His car came to a stop and I just thought , ‘ Wow . ’ I know he is kicking himself for whatever happened there . It ’ s the last type of mistake I would expect to see . I was just hoping that I could stay alongside of him . You can count on some guys making mistakes , but I didn ’ t think Marcos would make one . To see him make that was totally off the wall . " 
 Martin Truex , Jr. was furious because of the accident involving himself and Jeff Gordon . Gordon apologized for the collision , but Truex vowed , " We ’ ll get him . " From a second @-@ place finish , Robby Gordon said , " My team needs a little bit of morale here and there . This will be a morale boost back at the workshop .

 Franklin Knight Lane ( July 15 , 1864 – May 18 , 1921 ) was a political progressive and American Democratic politician from California who served as United States Secretary of the Interior from 1913 to 1920 . He also served as a commissioner of the Interstate Commerce Commission , and was the Democratic nominee for Governor of California in 1902 , losing a narrow race in what was then a heavily Republican state . 
 Lane was born July 15 , 1864 , near Charlottetown , Prince Edward Island , in what was then a British colony but is now part of Canada , and in 1871 , his family moved to California . After attending the University of California while working part @-@ time as a reporter , Lane became a New York correspondent for the San Francisco Chronicle , and later became editor and part owner of a newspaper . Elected City Attorney of San Francisco in 1898 , a post he held for five years , Lane ran in 1902 for governor and in 1903 for mayor of San Francisco , losing both races . In 1903 , he received the support of the Democratic minority in the California State Legislature during the legislature 's vote to elect a United States Senator from California . 
 Appointed a commissioner of the Interstate Commerce Commission by U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt in 1905 and confirmed by the Senate the following year , Lane was reappointed in 1909 by President William Howard Taft . His fellow commissioners elected him as chairman in January 1913 . The following month , Lane accepted President @-@ elect Woodrow Wilson 's nomination to become Secretary of the Interior , a position in which he served almost seven years until his resignation in early 1920 . Lane 's record on conservation was mixed : he supported the controversial Hetch Hetchy Reservoir project in Yosemite National Park , which flooded a valley esteemed by many conservationists , but also presided over the establishment of the National Park Service . 
 The former Secretary died of heart disease at the Mayo Clinic in Rochester , Minnesota , on May 18 , 1921 . Because of two decades of poorly paid government service , and the expenses of his final illness , he left no estate , and a public fund was established to support his widow . Newspapers reported that it was often said of Lane that had he not been born in what is now Canada , he would have become president . In spite of that limitation , Lane was offered support for the Democratic nomination for Vice President , though he was constitutionally ineligible for that office as well . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Lane was born near Charlottetown , Prince Edward Island , on July 15 , 1864 , the first of four children of Christopher Lane and the former Caroline Burns . Christopher Lane was a preacher who owned a farm outside Charlottetown ; when his voice began to fail , he became a dentist . The elder Lane , disliking the island colony 's cold climate , moved with his family to Napa , California in 1871 , and to Oakland in 1876 , where Franklin graduated from Oakland High School . Franklin Lane was hired to work in the printing office of the Oakland Times , then worked as a reporter , and in 1884 campaigned for the Prohibition Party . From 1884 to 1886 , he attended the University of California at Berkeley , though he did not graduate . Lane later wrote , " I put myself through college by working on vacation and after hours , and I am very glad I did it . " He later received honorary Doctor of Laws degrees from the University of California , from New York University , Brown University , and the University of North Carolina . After leaving college , he worked as a reporter for the San Francisco Chronicle . In 1889 , he was admitted to the California Bar , having attended Hastings Law School . 
 Rather than practicing law , Lane moved to New York City to continue his newspaper career as a correspondent for the Chronicle . There he became a protégé of the reformer Henry George and a member of New York 's Reform Club . He returned to the West Coast in 1891 as editor and part owner of the Tacoma News . He was successful in driving a corrupt chief of police into exile in Alaska , but the business venture as a whole was unsuccessful , and the paper declared bankruptcy in 1894 , a victim of the poor economy and Lane 's espousal of Democratic and Populist Party causes . In 1893 , Lane married Anne Wintermute ; they had two children , Franklin Knight Lane , Jr. and Nancy Lane Kauffman . 
 Lane moved back to California in late 1894 , and began to practice law in San Francisco with his brother George . He also wrote for Arthur McEwen 's Letter , a newspaper which crusaded against corruption , especially in the San Francisco Bay area and in the Southern Pacific Railroad . In 1897 – 98 , he served on the Committee of One Hundred , a group which was tasked with drafting a new city charter . The charter required the city to own its own water supply .

 In 1898 , Lane , running as a Democrat , was elected to the combined position of City and County Attorney , defeating California 's sitting Attorney General , W. F. Fitzgerald , by 832 votes in a year that otherwise saw most offices across the state fall to the Republicans . He was re @-@ elected in 1899 and 1901 . 
 Lane ran for Governor of California in 1902 on the Democratic and Non @-@ Partisan tickets . At a time when California was dominated by the Republican Party , he lost by less than a percentage point to George Pardee . ( Theodore Roosevelt won the state by 35 points two years later . ) Between 8 @,@ 000 and 10 @,@ 000 votes were disqualified on various technicalities , possibly costing him the election . During the campaign , the influential San Francisco Examiner slanted its news coverage against him . Examiner owner William Randolph Hearst later denied responsibility for this policy , and stated that if Lane ever needed anything , he should send Hearst a telegram . Lane retorted that if Hearst received a telegram purportedly signed by Lane , asking him to do anything , he could be sure it was a forgery . 
 Journalist Grant Wallace wrote of Lane at the time of the gubernatorial campaign : 
 That Lane is a man of earnestness and vigorous action is shown in ... every movement . You sit down to chat with him in his office . As he grows interested in the subject , he kicks his chair back , thrusts his hands way to the elbows in his trouser pockets and strides up and down the room . With deepening interest he speaks more rapidly and forcibly , and charges back and forth across the carpet with the heavy tread of a grenadier . 
 At the time , the state legislatures still elected United States Senators , and in 1903 , Lane received the vote of the state legislature 's Democratic minority in the Senate election . However , the majority Republicans backed incumbent George Clement Perkins , who was duly re @-@ elected . Later that year , City Attorney Lane ran for mayor of San Francisco , but again was defeated , finishing third in the race . He returned to the private practice of law , and would not again stand for elective office . 
 Even before the mayoral election , there was support for Lane as a potential Democratic candidate for Vice President , though since he was born in what was by then a Canadian province he was ineligible under the Twelfth Amendment to the United States Constitution . In an era when political convention delegates were far more free to make their own choices than they are today , Lane wrote that he had heard that he could gain the support of the New York delegation , which he declined to do . While returning to California from a trip to Washington , D.C. , as an advocate for the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir project , he stopped in Austin , Texas , to confer with Democratic leaders and address the legislature . The New York Times saw this as part of a campaign to secure the vice @-@ presidential nomination , and stated that he had been promised help from Texas .

 The railroad companies , which were loosely regulated by the Interstate Commerce Commission ( ICC ) , exercised great power in California because of the lack of alternate means of shipping freight . Lane had taken cases against those corporations in his law practice , and , in his gubernatorial campaign , had argued that they had too much power . In early 1904 , Benjamin Wheeler , president of the University of California , suggested to President Roosevelt that Lane would be an admirable choice to serve on the ICC . Roosevelt agreed , and promised to name him to the next ICC vacancy . When that vacancy occurred in early 1905 , Roosevelt forgot his promise and instead named retiring five @-@ term Senator Francis Cockrell of Missouri . Wheeler wrote to remind Roosevelt that he had said he would name Lane . Roosevelt apologized for his oversight , but noted that , as he had just been re @-@ elected , " I shall make ample amends to Lane later " . 
 In December 1905 , Commissioner Joseph W. Fifer resigned from the ICC and on December 6 , 1905 , President Roosevelt named Lane to fill the remaining four years in his term . Opposition to the appointment came from Republicans , who pointed out that were the nominee to be confirmed by the Senate , three of the five commissioners would be from the minority Democratic Party . Historian Bill G. Reid , in his journal article about Lane , suggests that Lane 's liberal record was a factor in the Senate 's hesitation to confirm him . The dispute held up Senate approval . However , Republican Congressman William Peters Hepburn proposed legislation which , though its primary purpose was increased railroad regulation , would expand the Commission by two members . Roosevelt indicated that he would appoint Republicans to the new positions , and opposition to Lane 's nomination dissipated . The resultant Hepburn Act was signed by President Roosevelt on June 29 , 1906 , while his nominee was confirmed the same day and was sworn in on July 2 , 1906 . 
 The City of San Francisco suffered a severe earthquake on April 18 , 1906 . Lane , who was living in north Berkeley while awaiting Senate confirmation , hurried to the city within hours of the earthquake to do what he could to help . Mayor Eugene E. Schmitz immediately appointed him to the Committee of Fifty to deal with the devastation of the earthquake and subsequent fire , and plan the rebuilding of the city . According to Lane 's friend , writer Will Irwin , Lane did not content himself with committee work , but personally fought the fire , helping to save much of the Western Addition . In late April , the commissioner @-@ designate took the train east to Washington , where he unsuccessfully fought to obtain Federal money to help the city 's recovery . 
 = = = Commission work = = = 
 The new commissioner spent the second half of 1906 attending ICC hearings around the country . The Hepburn Act had given the Commission broad powers over the railroads , and the Commission worked to deal not only with past railroad abuses , but to strike a balance between the desires of railroads and those of shippers . 
 There was a severe shortage of coal in the Upper Midwest in late 1906 , especially in North Dakota , and President Roosevelt ordered an investigation . Railroad companies were accused of failing to send cars with coal to that region that could then be used to transport grain from that region to Great Lakes ports . It was alleged the companies were waiting for the lakes to freeze over before sending cars so that the grain would have to be transported by rail all the way to market instead of by water transport . Lane led the inquiry and held hearings in Chicago , and concluded that the car shortage was due to demand for cars further west , and that it would actually cause area railways to lose money since they could not transport the grain to port . In January 1907 , he submitted his report to Roosevelt , which set out the causes of the shortage . He found that fifty million bushels of grain still remained on North Dakota farms or in the state 's grain elevators , because of lack of space in eastbound railroad cars . He recommended that railroad companies pool their cars with neighboring lines . 
 The Commission spent much of 1907 investigating the railroads and other companies owned by Edward H. Harriman , holding hearings across the country . In October , Lane determined that the Southern Pacific Railroad , one of Harriman 's lines , was engaged in rebating , a practice of effectively giving special rates to favored shippers that had been outlawed by the Hepburn Act . 
 Lane was reappointed as commissioner by President William Howard Taft on December 7 , 1909 , this time to a full seven @-@ year term , and was confirmed by the Senate three days later . He was also approached by , as he put it , " a good many people " who urged him to seek the Democratic nomination for Governor of California in 1910 . He did not run , remaining an ICC commissioner . Taft designated Lane as a U.S. delegate to the 1910 International Railways Congress . The Congress , which convened every five years , met in Berne , Switzerland . Before adjourning in anticipation of meeting in 1915 in Berlin , it elected Lane to its Permanent International Commission . 
 On July 1 , 1911 , the ICC ordered a " sweeping investigation " into the activities of express companies , which transported and delivered parcels . Lane presided over a lengthy hearing in New York in November 1911 . Fellow Commissioner James S. Harlan noted that after hearing of the abuses of the express system , Lane recommended to Congress that it establish a parcel post service as part of the United States Post Office Department . Parcel post began on January 1 , 1913 , and was an immediate success . 
 Early in 1912 , Commissioner Lane returned to New York to preside over hearings ( begun on the Commission 's own initiative ) into oil pipelines . While investigating the sale of pipelines to the Standard Oil Company , he grew frustrated with the testimony of a witness who , though secretary of several pipeline companies , could not say who authorized the sales . " I don 't want to deal with a clerk or one of your $ 5 @,@ 000 a year men . I want testimony from someone who can speak with authority . " The Commission held that oil pipelines were common carriers , and ordered the companies owning them to file rate schedules and otherwise comply with the Interstate Commerce Act . 
 Lane also gave attention to improving the ICC 's internal capabilities . Lane and his ally , fellow Commissioner Balthasar H. Meyer , supported increasing the Commission 's ability to compute marginal rates , and the Commission engaged noted economist Max O. Lorenz ( inventor of the Lorenz curve ) for this task . Lane also advocated the creation of a new commission with powers over any corporation engaged in interstate commerce , as the best way to prevent trusts .

 In the 1912 presidential election , Lane supported Democratic candidate and New Jersey Governor Woodrow Wilson , though he declined to make campaign speeches on Wilson 's behalf , citing ICC policy that commissioners act in a nonpartisan manner . Wilson was elected on November 5 , 1912 , and on November 21 the commissioner spent much of the day with Colonel Edward House , the President @-@ elect 's advisor , who would play a key role in selecting Cabinet appointees . The possibility of Lane becoming Secretary of the Interior was discussed , but he indicated he was happy in his present position . After the meeting , Lane had second thoughts , and asked House if he would have a free hand as Interior Secretary . House indicated that were he to prove capable in the position , Wilson would not interfere . Colonel House did not immediately recommend Lane for the job , but went on to consider other candidates , such as former San Francisco mayor James D. Phelan and Wilson friend Walter Page . 
 At the ICC meeting on January 8 , 1913 , the commissioners elected Lane as the new chairman , effective January 13 . Wilson continued to keep his Cabinet intentions quiet , and Lane noted in January 1913 of those who met with the President @-@ elect in New Jersey , " nobody comes back from Trenton knowing anything more than when he went " . On February 16 , House met again with him ( on Wilson 's instructions ) to get a better sense of the ICC chairman 's views on conservation . According to House 's diaries , Lane , while reluctant to leave his position as chairman , was willing to serve in the Interior position if offered . He considered the position the most difficult Cabinet post but was also willing to serve in any other capacity . 
 As Wilson adjusted his lineup of potential Cabinet appointees , he and House considered Lane for the positions of Attorney General and Secretary of War . Finally , Wilson wrote to him on February 24 , 1913 , offering him the Interior position , and , although the two had never met , he accepted the post . According to The New York Times , Chairman Lane was selected since he was one of the few California Democrats who had fought the railroads and who was not beholden to Hearst . At the time , it was customary not to make an official announcement of Cabinet appointments until the new President formally submitted the names to the Senate on the afternoon of Inauguration Day , March 4 ; however , The New York Times obtained the list of Wilson 's appointees a day early . The Senate met in special session on March 5 , and approved all of President Wilson 's Cabinet appointees . 
 = = = Department activities = = = 
 The Department of the Interior in 1913 was a hodgepodge of different agencies . Many of them , such as the Pensions Office , Indian Office , and General Land Office had been departmental responsibilities since the Interior Department was organized in 1849 . Others , such as the Bureau of Education , the Geological Survey and the Bureau of Mines , had been added later . The Department was also responsible for national parks , the Patent Office , the United States Capitol building and grounds , Howard University , Gallaudet University , St. Elizabeths Hospital and the Maritime Canal Company of Nicaragua , charged with building a canal upon which work had been suspended for twenty years . 
 Soon after taking office in 1913 , Lane became involved in the Hetch Hetchy Valley dispute . San Francisco had long sought to dam the Tuolumne River in Yosemite National Park to create a reservoir that would assure a steady flow of water to the city . Lane had supported the project as City Attorney and continued his advocacy as the new Interior Secretary . The Hetch Hetchy project was strongly opposed by many conservationists , led by John Muir , who said , " Dam Hetch Hetchy ! As well dam for water tanks the people 's cathedrals and churches ; for no holier temple has ever been consecrated by the heart of man . " In spite of Muir 's objections , Lane was successful : Congress authorized the project after a long and bitter battle . 
 The new Secretary sought allies in Congress to implement his agenda . One such ally was the new junior senator from Montana , Thomas J. Walsh , whose support was key to the passage of the Hetch Hetchy legislation . While Walsh dissented from Lane 's policies on national parks , for example by supporting local control of development in his home state 's Glacier National Park , he sided with him on subjects ranging from development of Alaska to reclamation projects . The Interior Secretary advocated leasing , rather than selling , public lands with possible mineral deposits , and Senator Walsh pursued legislation in this area . While the two were successful in providing for coal land leasing in Alaska , a general minerals leasing bill would not be passed until shortly after Lane left office in 1920 . 
 In July 1913 , Lane left on a long inspection tour of National Parks , Indian reservations , and other areas under the Interior Department 's jurisdiction . Fearful that local employees would control what he was allowed to see , he sent an assistant to visit each site and provide him with a complete report on it two weeks in advance of his arrival . The tour was interrupted in August , when President Wilson asked his Interior Secretary to go to Denver and serve as his representative at the Conference of Governors . Lane did , and then rejoined his inspection party in San Francisco . After several days of meetings there , he collapsed because of an attack of angina pectoris . After three weeks recuperating , he returned to Washington against medical advice to resume his work . 
 As Interior Secretary , Lane was responsible for the territories , and advocated the development of the Alaska Territory . While private railroads had been established there , they were not successful , and he pushed for a government @-@ built railroad , which he believed would lead to large @-@ scale population movement into Alaska . In 1914 , Congress passed a bill authorizing construction of the Alaska Railroad , which passed the Senate following a two @-@ day speech in support by Walsh . Lane was the first Interior Secretary to appoint an Alaska resident , John Franklin Alexander Strong , as territorial governor . Secretary Lane 's vision for the territory was , " Alaska should not , in my judgment , be regarded as a mere storehouse of materials on which the people of the States may draw . She has the potentialities of a State . And whatever policies may be adopted should look toward an Alaska of homes , of industries , and of an extended commerce . " 
 Despite his role in the Hetch Hetchy controversy , Lane was friendly towards the National Park movement , and in 1915 hired Stephen Mather to oversee the parks for which the Department was responsible . Mather , a self @-@ made millionaire and member of the Sierra Club , had written Lane a bitter letter in late 1914 , complaining that the national parks were being exploited for private profit . Lane was intrigued by Mather 's letter , made inquiry , and found that Mather was well thought of by Lane 's friends — and had , like Lane , attended the University of California . Mather 's advocacy led to the establishment of the National Park Service in 1916 . 
 In 1915 , Lane returned to San Francisco to open the Panama @-@ Pacific International Exposition . The President was supposed to open the fair , but was unable to attend , and sent the Interior Secretary in his place . In 1916 , Wilson appointed Lane to lead the American delegation and meet with the Mexican commissioners at Atlantic City , New Jersey about the unstable military situation in Mexico . These negotiations led to the withdrawal of United States troops from Mexico . 
 The Interior Department had never had a central headquarters , but had worked from offices scattered across Washington , with the bulk of the department located in the old Patent Office building . The Secretary lobbied for a new building for the Department , and , after Congress appropriated the funds , construction went ahead and the building was opened in early 1917 . The structure , located at 1800 F Street N.W. , now houses the General Services Administration . 
 Mather , who had been appointed the first director of the National Park Service , began to display apparent mental illness in 1917 . His assistant , Horace Albright , reported this condition to Lane . The Secretary chose to keep Mather in his position , while allowing Albright to perform the functions of Mather 's job until Mather recovered , keeping all of this secret . According to Albright , Lane was not a conservationist , but did not care to interfere in the decisions of his officials , and so let Mather and Albright have free rein . Lane wrote in 1917 : 
 A wilderness , no matter how impressive and beautiful , does not satisfy this soul of mine , ( if I have that kind of thing ) . It is a challenge to man . It says , ' Master me ! Put me to use ! Make me something more than I <unk> 
 = = = World War I responsibilities = = = 
 In 1916 , Wilson appointed Lane to the Council of National Defense ( CND ) , where he urged cooperation between the private and public sectors . He defused a difficult situation for the CND when it decided to merge its male @-@ dominated state and local organizations with the separate Women 's Committee into a unified Field Division . Lane headed the Division , leading a board of five men and five women . 
 Lane bitterly opposed what he saw as the President 's hesitation to commit the country to war . He wrote to his brother George in February 1917 : 
 ... in Mexico , Cuba , Costa Rica , and Europe we have trouble . The country is growing tired of delay , and without positive leadership is losing its keenness of conscience and becoming inured to insult . Our Ambassador in Berlin is held as a hostage for days — our Consuls ' wives are stripped naked at the border , our ships are sunk , our people killed — and yet we wait and wait ! What for I do not know . Germany is winning by her bluff , for she has our ships interned in our own harbors . 
 Lane was a strong advocate of preparedness in the prelude to U.S. involvement in World War I. In early 1917 , he urged Wilson to authorize the arming and convoying of merchant vessels . Wilson refused , but changed his mind when informed of the Zimmermann Telegram . In a critical Cabinet meeting in March 1917 , Lane , with other Cabinet members , urged American intervention in the war . 
 With Lane 's support , the nation 's railroads voluntarily united to form a Railroad War Board to meet the emergency . Lane made many effective speeches for the Committee on Public Information . The Secretary penned two brief works for the Committee , Why We Are Fighting Germany and The American Spirit , which were well received and widely distributed . He urged businessmen to make " sacrifices as worthy as those of the men on their way to the trenches " . President Wilson reportedly stopped discussing matters of importance at Cabinet meetings because the " gregarious " Lane divulged confidential matters . 
 Lane was a supporter of the Treaty of Versailles and of the League of Nations . He wrote articles urging , in vain , U.S. ratification of the treaty establishing the international organization . 
 = = Later life and legacy = = 
 On December 17 , 1919 , Lane confirmed rumors that had been circulating in Washington for some months that he would be leaving the Cabinet . Secretary Lane stated that he had not done so earlier because of President Wilson 's illness . While he gave no specific reason for his departure , The New York Times reported that Lane had found it difficult to make ends meet on a Cabinet officer 's salary of $ 12 @,@ 000 and desired to make more money for himself and his family . 
 As Lane prepared to leave office in January 1920 , he reflected on the postwar world : 
 But the whole world is skew @-@ <unk> , awry , distorted and altogether perverse . The President is broken in body , and obstinate in spirit . Clemenceau is beaten for an office he did not want . Einstein has declared the law of gravitation outgrown and decadent . ... Oh God , I pray , give me peace and a quiet chop . I do not ask for power , nor for fame , nor yet for wealth . 
 Lane resigned in February 1920 , and left office on March 1 . He subsequently accepted employment as Vice President and legal advisor to the Mexican Petroleum Company , which was run by Edward Doheny ( who , after Lane 's death , would be implicated in the Teapot Dome scandal ) , as well as a directorship of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company . 
 In a letter to Democratic Presidential candidate and Ohio Governor James M. Cox in July 1920 , Lane set forth his vision for America : 
 We want our unused lands put to use . We want the farm made more attractive through better rural schools , more roads everywhere ... [ W ] e want more men with garden homes instead of tenement homes . We want our waters , that flow idly to the sea , put to use ... [ W ] e want fewer boys and girls , men and women , who cannot read or write the language of our laws , newspapers , and literature ... [ T ] he framing of our policies should not be left to emotional caprice , or the opportunism of any group of men , but should be result of sympathetic and deep studies by the wisest men we have , regardless of their politics ... [ W ] e want our soldiers and sailors to be more certain of our gratitude ... [ W ] e are to extend our activities into all parts of the world . Our trade is to grow as never before . Our people are to resume their old place as traders on the seven seas . We are to know other people better and make them all more and more our friends , working with them as mutually dependent factors in the growth of the world 's life 
 By early 1921 , Lane 's health was failing , and he sought treatment at the Mayo Clinic . He was able to leave the Clinic and spend the remainder of the winter in warmer areas as advised by his physicians , but soon returned . Lane 's heart was in such poor condition that the Clinic could not give him general anesthesia during his heart operation . Lane survived the operation , and wrote of the ordeal , but died soon afterward . According to his brother , George Lane , the former Secretary left no will or estate . The vice @-@ president of Lane 's company noted that the Californian had worked 21 years for the Government on a " living salary " , and the earnings from the one year of substantial wages had been heavily sapped by illness . Lane 's body was cremated , and his ashes thrown to the winds from atop El Capitan peak in Yosemite National Park . 
 According to newspapers reporting Lane 's death , it was said that had he been born in the United States he would have been elected President . Following Lane 's death , a memorial committee was formed by Secretary of Commerce Herbert Hoover , former Assistant Secretary of the Navy Franklin D. Roosevelt and former Lane assistant and member of the Federal Reserve Board Adolph C. Miller . The committee established a Franklin K. Lane Memorial Fund , initially dedicated to the support of Lane 's widow , Anne Lane , and upon her death to be used to promote causes in which her husband believed . The two future presidents , Miller , and National Park Service Director Mather were among the major contributors to the fund . In 1939 , after Mrs. Lane 's death , the corpus of the trust ( just over $ 100 @,@ 000 ) was transferred to the former Secretary 's alma mater , the University of California , to promote the understanding and improvement of the American system of democratic government . Fifty years later , the entrusted amount , still administered by the University , had grown to almost $ 1 @.@ 9 million . In November 1921 , Lane Peak in Mount Rainier National Park was named for the former Secretary . Other tributes to Lane included a World War II Liberty ship , a New York City high school , and a California redwood grove . Lane 's patriotic essay " Makers of the Flag " adapted from a speech he delivered to Interior Department employees on Flag Day 1914 , continues to be reprinted as a speech and in schoolbooks . 
 = Hisar ( city ) = 
 Hisar pronunciation , previously spelled <unk> , is the core of Hisar Urban Agglomeration and administrative headquarters of Hisar district of Hisar division in the state of Haryana in northwestern India . It is located 164 km ( 102 mi ) to the west of New Delhi , India 's capital , and has been identified as a counter @-@ magnet city for the National Capital Region to develop as an alternative center of growth to Delhi . 
 The city was ruled by several major powers , including the <unk> in the third century BC , the <unk> in the 14th century , the Mughals in the 16th century , and the British in the 19th century . After India achieved independence , it was unified with the state of Punjab . When the Punjab was divided in 1966 , Hisar became part of Haryana . 
 The current name was given in 1354 AD , as Hisar @-@ e @-@ Firoza by Firuz Shah Tughlaq , the Sultan of Delhi from 1351 to 1388 . The Ghaggar and Drishadvati Rivers once flowed through the city , but they have now changed their course . Hisar has a continental climate , with very hot summers and relatively cool winters .
