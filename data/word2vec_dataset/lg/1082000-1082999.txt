 From 1993 to 1996 , Apple developed a marketing strategy that promised free and unlimited live @-@ telephone support on certain products for as long as the original purchaser owned those products ; by 1997 , however , changes in Apple 's <unk> support policy led Apple to rescind the offer , resulting in a consumer class action lawsuit for breach of contract . Apple denied wrongdoing but , in settlement of the claims , Apple ultimately reinstated the telephone support for the duration of original ownership of the otherwise obsolete products and customers affected by the change were given a limited reimbursement if they had been refused telephone support , had been charged per incident , or had incurred third party support charges . 
 = = = iPod battery life class action = = = 
 In 2004 and 2005 , two state @-@ level class action suits were filed against Apple in New York and California alleging the first , second , and third generation iPod music players sold prior to May 2004 did not have the battery life represented and / or that the battery 's capacity to take and hold a charge substantially diminished over time . Rather than litigate these claims , Apple entered into a settlement agreement in August 2005 after a fairness hearing in the California action , with the settlement terms designed to end the New York action as well . An appeal followed the California court 's approval of the settlement but the appellate court upheld the settlement in December 2005 . Eligible members of the class were entitled to extended warranties , store credit , cash compensation , or battery replacement , and some incentive payments , with all <unk> claims expiring after September 2005 . Apple agreed to pay all costs of the litigation , including incentive payments to the class members and the plaintiffs ' attorney fees , but admitted no fault . In 2006 Apple Canada , Inc . , also settled several similar Canadian class action suits alleging misrepresentations by Apple regarding iPod battery life . 
 = = = iPad and iPhone privacy issue class action = = = 
 In December 2010 , two separate groups of iPhone and iPad users sued Apple , alleging that certain software applications were passing personal user information to third @-@ party advertisers without the users ' consent . The individual cases were consolidated in the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of California , San Jose division , under the title In Re iPhone Application <unk> , and further defendants were added to the action . The complainants petitioned the court for a ban on the " passing of user information without consent and monetary compensation , " claimed damages for breach of privacy , and sought redress for other enumerated claims . Press reports stated that in April 2011 , Apple agreed to amend its developer agreement to stop this from happening " except for information directly necessary for the functionality of the apps " ; however , the suit alleged that Apple took no steps to do this or enforce it " in any meaningful way due to criticism from advertising networks " . 
 The Associated Press reported a pending congressional inquiry into the matter , with United States Congress members stating that commercial storage and usage of location information without a consumer 's express consent is illegal under current law , but Apple defended its use of customer tracking in a letter released May 9 , 2011 , by the House of Representatives . National Public Radio 's senior director of technology published an article examining the data collected by his own iPhone , showing examples of the data collected and maps correlating the data . Separately , digital forensics researchers reported they regularly use the data collected from Apple mobile devices in working with law enforcement officials investigating crimes and have been doing so since at least mid @-@ 2010 . In contrast with earlier statements , Apple revealed in a hearing with the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee that a " software bug " caused iPhones to continue to send anonymous location data to the company 's servers , even when location services on the device were turned off . 
 In September 2011 , the District Court granted Apple 's motion to dismiss for lack of Article III standing and failure to state a claim , but gave the plaintiffs leave to amend their complaint , thereby not shutting out the claims permanently . The court ruled that without a showing of legal damages <unk> under current law , the plaintiffs had not shown they sustained injury in fact by the defendants ' actions . The problem facing the plaintiffs is the current state of electronic privacy law , the issue being that there is no national privacy law that provides for compensatory damages for breach of privacy , and this is the same issue faced by victims of data breaches , as breaches , per se , sustain no legal damages without a showing of actual and measurable harm such as monetary loss . Under U.S. law as of July 2012 , it is only when a data breach results in actual loss as defined by applicable law that <unk> damages arise . The case remained on the California court 's docket as of July 2012 . 
 = = = iTunes price @-@ switching class action = = = 
 In June 2009 , a group of consumers filed the class action suits Owens v. Apple , Inc. and Johnson v. Apple Inc. against Apple on behalf of American individuals who purchased iTunes gift cards and who were then unable to use the cards to purchase iTunes music at the price advertised on the card because Apple raised the price of the music after it sold the cards to consumers . The Johnson case absorbed the Owens case and was settled on February 10 , 2012 , with payments to be made to consumers by Apple . The Owens complaint alleged that Apple wrongfully marketed , distributed , and sold iTunes gift cards and songs through its online iTunes store , while representing that consumers could use the gift cards to purchase songs for US $ .99 a song and then , after such gift cards were purchased , raised the price on certain songs to $ 1 @.@ 29 on April 7 , 2009 . The lawsuit 's allegations included that Apple 's conduct constituted breach of contract , violated the state consumer fraud statute , and violated consumer protection statutes of other states . The plaintiffs sought a $ .30 refund remedy for each song that class members purchased using a $ .99 iTunes card for which they were charged $ 1 @.@ 29 , plus their attorneys ' fees and costs . Apple mounted a vigorous defense and sought to dismiss the suit but lost its motion in December 2009 . Individuals are part of the class of plaintiffs if they are U.S. residents who purchased or received an iTunes Gift Card on which the card itself or its packaging contained language to the effect that songs were priced at $ 0 @.@ 99 and who used the card to purchase one or more $ 1 @.@ 29 songs from the iTunes Store on or before May 10 , 2010 . The settlement provides class members with an iTunes Store credit of $ 3 @.@ 25 if an online claim form was submitted on or before September 24 , 2012 .

 In 2004 , independent Apple resellers filed a lawsuit against Apple alleging the company used misleading advertising practices by using unfair business practices that harmed the resellers ' sales while boosting Apple @-@ owned outlets , in effect by favoring its own outlets over those of its resellers .

The complaint alleged Apple 's acts in favoring its own stores constituted breach of contract , false advertising , fraud , trade libel , defamation , and intentional interference with prospective economic advantage . As of 2006 , Apple reached settlements with all of the plaintiffs , including the bankruptcy trustee for one reseller that failed , while the former principal of that company appealed the bankruptcy court 's approval of the settlement .

 = = = Libel dispute with Carl Sagan = = = 
 In 1994 , engineers at Apple Computer code @-@ named the mid @-@ level Power Macintosh 7100 " Carl Sagan " after the popular astronomer in the hope that Apple would make " billions and billions " with the sale of the computer . Apple used the name only internally , but Sagan was concerned that it would become a product endorsement and sent Apple a cease @-@ and @-@ desist letter . Apple complied , but its engineers retaliated by changing the internal codename to " BHA " for " Butt @-@ Head Astronomer " . 
 Sagan then sued Apple for libel in federal court . The court granted Apple 's motion to dismiss Sagan 's claims and opined in dicta that a reader aware of the context would understand Apple was " clearly attempting to retaliate in a humorous and satirical way " , and that " It strains reason to conclude that Defendant was attempting to criticize Plaintiff 's reputation or competency as an astronomer . One does not seriously attack the expertise of a scientist using the undefined phrase ' butt @-@ head ' . " Sagan then sued for Apple 's original use of his name and likeness , but again lost and appealed that ruling . In November 1995 , Apple and Sagan reached an out @-@ of @-@ court settlement and Apple 's office of trademarks and patents released a conciliatory statement that " Apple has always had great respect for Dr. Sagan . It was never Apple 's intention to cause Dr. Sagan or his family any embarrassment or concern " . Apple 's third and final code name for the project was " <unk> " , short for " Lawyers are <unk> " .

 For nearly 30 years Apple Corps ( The Beatles @-@ founded record label and holding company ) and Apple Inc . ( then Apple Computer ) litigated a dispute involving the use of the name " Apple " as a trademark and its association with music . In 1978 , Apple Corps filed suit against Apple Computer for trademark infringement and the parties settled in 1981 with Apple Computer paying an undisclosed amount to Apple Corps , later revealed to be $ 80 @,@ 000 . A primary condition of the settlement was that Apple Computer agreed to stay out of the music business . In 1991 , after Apple introduced the Apple <unk> with an Ensoniq music synthesizer chip , Apple Corps alleged the product to be in violation of the terms of their settlement . The parties then reached another settlement agreement and Apple paid Apple Corps around $ 26 @.@ 5 million , with Apple agreeing it would not package , sell , or distribute physical music materials . 
 In September 2003 , Apple Corps again sued Apple Computer alleging Apple Computer had breached the settlement once more , this time for introducing iTunes and the iPod . Apple Corps alleged Apple Computer 's introduction of the music @-@ playing products with the iTunes Music Store violated the terms of the previous agreement in which Apple agreed not to distribute music . The trial opened on March 29 , 2006 , in the UK. and ended on May 8 , 2006 , with the court issuing judgement in favor of Apple Computer . " [ I ] find no breach of the trademark agreement has been demonstrated , " the presiding Justice Mann said . 
 On February 5 , 2007 , Apple Inc. and Apple Corps announced another settlement of their trademark dispute , agreeing that Apple Inc. would own all of the trademarks related to ' Apple ' and would license certain of those trademarks back to Apple Corps for its continued use . The settlement ended the ongoing trademark lawsuit between the companies , with each party bearing its own legal costs , and Apple Inc. continuing to use the Apple name and logos on iTunes . The settlement 's full terms were confidential .

 = = = = = <unk> = = = = = 
 The Apple @-@ Cohen dispute was a cybersquatting case where a top @-@ level domain registrar 's decision differed from prior decisions by awarding a domain name to a subsequent registrant ( Apple ) , rather than to the prior registrant ( Cohen ) . As the decision recounts , in November 2000 , Benjamin Cohen of <unk> registered the domain name <unk> The domain initially pointed to <unk> , and then to <unk> , and was then inoperative for some time . Apple applied for a UK trademark for iTunes in October 2000 which was granted in March 2001 , and then launched its UK iTunes music store service in 2004 . Afterward , Cohen reactivated his registered domain name , redirecting it to iTunes ' then @-@ rival , Napster ; later Cohen forwarded the domain name to his <unk> 's cash back / rewards website . 
 In 2005 , Apple took the matter to the Dispute Resolution Service operated by .uk domain name registry Nominet UK ( the DRS ) , claiming that Apple had trademark rights in the name " iTunes " and that the use of the domain name by Cohen 's company was abusive ( these being the two tests under the DRS rules for prevailing in a matter where the complaint related only to the later use of a trademarked name ) . The dispute was unresolved at the free mediation stage and so Apple paid for an independent expert to decide the case ; the expert decided the dispute in Apple 's favor . 
 Cohen thereafter launched a media offensive claiming the DRS was biased in favor of large businesses and made frequent threats of lawsuits against Nominet . Cohen stated he believed that the DRS system was unfair for a number of reasons and would seek redress against Nominet with the High Court via judicial review . Nominet stated that Cohen should appeal the case via the appeal process in the DRS . Cohen refused and , after several months , instead issued proceedings for judicial review . The High Court at first instance rejected Cohen 's case in August 2005 , noting that Cohen 's company , <unk> Group Ltd . , should have used the appeal process forming part of Nominet 's domain resolution service . Afterward , Cohen 's company asked for a rehearing and , as that case progressed , the interim domain name was transferred to Apple in accord with the expert 's decision and thereafter pointed to the Apple music site . In November 2005 , Cohen dropped all legal action against Apple .

 In 2006 , Cisco Systems and Apple negotiated over allowing Apple rights to use Cisco 's <unk> iPhone trademark , but the negotiations stalled when Cisco pushed for the two products to be <unk> . Following the public unveiling of the Apple iPhone at the 2007 Macworld Expo , Cisco filed a lawsuit against Apple in January 2007 , alleging Apple 's iPhone name infringed on Cisco 's iPhone trademark . Cisco alleged that Apple created a front company subsequent to their negotiations to try to acquire the rights another way , while Apple countered that there would be no likelihood of confusion between the two products , because Apple 's iPhone product was the first cell phone with such a name , while Cisco 's iPhone was a VoIP phone . Bloomberg reported Cisco 's iPhone as a product marketed for less than $ 100 and part of the <unk> home routers , enabling internet @-@ based calls through Skype and Yahoo ! Messenger , and contrasted it with Apple 's iPhone as a mobile phone which sold for around $ 600 . In February 2007 , Cisco and Apple announced an agreement under which both companies would be allowed to use the iPhone name worldwide .

 In March 2007 , Apple opposed a trademark application by startup Sector Labs , which sought to register " Video Pod " as a mark identifying goods associated with a video projector product . Apple argued that the proposed mark was merely " descriptive " and should be denied because the registration would cause a likelihood of confusion with Apple 's pre @-@ existing " iPod " marks . In March 2012 , the U.S. Trademark Trial and Appeal Board ( TTAB ) ruled in Apple 's favor and denied Sector Labs ' registration , finding that the " iPod " mark was " famous " and therefore entitled to broad protection under U.S. trademark law .

 In January 2008 , Apple filed an opposition with the U.S. Trademark Trial and Appeal Board against New York City 's ( NYC ) trademark application for the " Big Apple " logo for NYC 's <unk> initiative , by designer Blake E.

The TTAB 's Notice of Publication was published in September 2007 and Apple filed an opposition with the TTAB the following January , claiming a likelihood of confusion . In June 2008 , NYC filed a motion to amend its application to delete the leaf element from its design , leaving the stem , and the TTAB dismissed Apple 's opposition and counterclaims in accordance with the parties ' stipulation in July 2008 . In November 2011 , the TTAB issued NYC 's trademark registration .

 In September 2008 , Apple sent a cease and desist letter to the Victoria School of Business and Technology in Saanich , British Columbia , claiming the school 's logo infringed Apple 's trademark rights and that the school 's logo falsely suggested Apple had authorized the school 's activities . The logo in question featured the outline of an apple and a leaf , although the design incorporated a mountain , had three bumps on top of the apple instead of the two used by Apple , and had no bite out of the apple , unlike Apple 's logo . In April 2011 , the school reported it had settled its 3 @-@ year dispute with Apple , was launching a new logo under a new name , Q College , and was expanding its operations .

 In October 2009 , Apple disputed a trademark application by Woolworths Limited in Australia over the new logo for its supermarket chain Woolworths Supermarkets , a stylised " W " , similar in shape to an apple . Apple reportedly took objection to the breadth of Woolworths ' application , which would allow it to brand products , including consumer electronics , with the logo . In April 2011 , Woolworths amended its trademark application to remove various goods and services , such as " apparatus for recording , transmission or reproduction of sound or images " and Apple withdrew its opposition , allowing the trademark to proceed to registration . In August 2011 Woolworths introduced a shopping app for the iPhone , and , as of July 2012 continues to use the logo , including on the face of its iPhone app . The Woolworth 's smartphone app is also available on Apple 's App Store where the logo is featured prominently ; Apple closely manages its App Store offerings .

 In 2006 , Apple secured Taiwanese rights to the iPad mark from the Taiwanese company Proview Electronics ; in China the iPad mark was still owned by the subsidiary of Proview Electronics , Shenzhen company Proview Technology , as of April 2012 . Proview Technology sued Apple over the rights to the mark in China in 2011 ; Apple counter @-@ sued but lost and then appealed , with the case before the Xicheng district court , where Proview claimed $ 1 @.@ 6 billion USD in damages . Apple paid Proview approximately $ 53 @,@ 000 – $ 55 @,@ 000 for the mark in 2009 . In February 2012 , Proview sued Apple in the Santa Clara Superior Court , alleging several permutations of fraud ( intentional misrepresentation , concealment , inducement ) and unfair competition . Apple paid $ 60 million to Proview to end the dispute in a court @-@ mediated settlement in the Higher People 's Court of Guangdong province ; the U.S. case was thrown out of court . 
 = = = = Amazon " App Store " = = = = 
 In 2011 , Apple filed suit against Amazon.com alleging trademark infringement , unfair competition , and dilution under the Lanham Act and related California state law over Amazon 's use of the " App Store " phrase relating to Amazon 's " Amazon Appstore Developer Portal " and Amazon 's alleged other similar uses of the phrase . In its complaint , Apple did not refer to " apps " as a common name , but described its applications store as a place consumers license " software programs or products " ; Amazon countered in its answer that " app store " is a common phrase meaning a " place to buy apps " . Reuters reported that Microsoft was opposing Apple 's attempted registration of the phrase as a trademark and that part of the matter was before the Trademark Trial and Appeal Board ( TTAB ) . Apple motioned the court for a preliminary injunction to bar Amazon from using the " App Store " name but , in July 2011 , U.S. District Judge Phyllis Hamilton , presiding over Apple 's case against Amazon , denied Apple 's motion . In July 2012 , the case was still in the discovery stage of litigation . 
 In January 2013 , Apple 's claims were rejected by a US District judge , who argued that the company presented no evidence that Amazon had " [ attempted ] to mimic Apple ’ s site or advertising " , or communicated that its service " possesses the characteristics and qualities that the public has come to expect from the Apple APP <unk> and / or Apple products " In July 2013 , Apple dropped the lawsuit .

 Ultimately decided under the title O 'Grady v. Superior Court , the suit filed by Apple against unnamed bloggers raised the issue for the first time of whether bloggers hold the same protections against revealing sources that journalists have . In November 2004 , three popular weblog sites featuring Apple rumors publicly revealed information about two unreleased Apple products , the Mac mini and an as yet unreleased product code @-@ named Asteroid , also known as Project <unk> . Apple subpoenaed three sites to force them to identify their confidential sources : Apple Insider , Power Page , and , separately , Think Secret , which did no original reporting on the case and thus had no sources to reveal . In February 2005 , a trial court in California decided that website operators do not have the same shield law protection as do other journalists . The journalists appealed and , in May 2006 , the California Court of Appeal reversed the trial court 's decision , ruling that activities in question were covered by the shield law .

 In Apple Computer v. <unk> , a case illustrating one of Apple 's methods of protecting its claims in trade secrets , Apple sued Think Secret 's parent company , the <unk> Organization LLC , and Think Secret 's editor in January 2005 , alleging misappropriation of trade secrets with regard to Think Secret 's stories on a " headless iMac " and new version of iWork . In response , <unk> filed a motion to dismiss the case based on First Amendment grounds under California 's state Anti @-@ <unk> statute , a law designed to dispense with meritless legal claims attempting to silence valid exercises of freedom of speech . In late 2007 , Think Secret announced " Apple and Think Secret have settled their lawsuit , reaching an agreement that results in a positive solution for both sides . As part of the confidential settlement , no sources were revealed and Think Secret will no longer be published " . 
 = = = Copyright = = = 
 = = = = Apple v. Franklin = = = = 
 Apple v. Franklin established the fundamental basis of copyright of computer software , even if it was provided only as object code or in firmware . In 1982 , Apple filed a lawsuit against Franklin Computer Corp. , alleging that Franklin 's ACE 100 personal computer used illegal copies of the Apple II 's operating system and ROM . The case was decided in Franklin 's favor but reversed by the Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit . 
 = = = = Object code cases and conflicts of law = = = = 
 Apple 's litigation over object code contributed to the development of contemporary copyright law because the company 's object code cases brought different results in different courts , creating a conflict of laws that resulted in international litigation . In the 1980s , Apple litigated two copyright cases with central issues that included the question of whether object code ( as contrasted with source code ) of a computer program is subject to copyright laws . A third case in which Apple was not a party but that involved the Apple decisions followed in New Zealand . The specific cases were Computer Edge Pty . Ltd. v Apple Computer Inc . ( 1986 , Australia ) ( " Computer Edge " ) , Apple Computer Inc. v Mackintosh Computers Ltd . , ( Canada , 1987 ) ( " Apple v. Mackintosh " ) , and IBM v. Computer Imports Ltd . ( " IBM v. Computer Imports " ) , ( New Zealand , 1989 ) . 
 In the Computer Edge case , the Australian court decided against the then @-@ prevailing opinions in other courts ( the U.K. , Canada , South Africa , and the U.S. ) and ruled object code was not copyrightable , while the Supreme Court of Canada in Apple v. Mackintosh reversed its earlier decisions and ruled that because object code was a translation of source code and embodied in a silicon chip , it was therefore a translation of an original literary work expressed in a material form and unauthorized reproduction of the object code was therefore an infringement of copyright . The Canadian court opined that programs within ROM silicon chips are protected under the Copyright Act of Canada and the conversion from the source code into object code is a form of translation . It further held that such translation does not include the expression of an idea in another form , but rather only applies to the expression of an idea in another language , and that a translation has a one @-@ to @-@ one correspondence between works that are expressed in two different languages . 
 In these conflict of laws cases , Apple met with conflicting international judicial opinions : an Australian court decision conflicted with a Canadian court decision on the <unk> of object code . In IBM v. Computer Imports , the High Court of New Zealand then considered these prior decisions and sided with the Canadian decision in ruling that , although object code is not an original literary work in its own right , it is a reproduction of source code in material form and therefore an infringement of copyright takes place if it is copied without the authorization of the copyright owner . Such legal conflicts affected not only Apple , but all other software companies as well , and the conflicts remained unresolved until the creation of an international legal regime embodied in further changes to national copyright laws , which ultimately made object code subject to copyright law . These revisions of law in favor of making object code subject to copyright law are still controversial . The revisions also form the technical underpinnings ( via the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act ) for the legal notions of electronic privacy violation and computer trespass , as well as the further development of anti @-@ hacking law @-@ making such as the Patriot Act and the Convention on <unk> .

After several years in court , Apple 's claims against Microsoft were dismissed , primarily due to a license John Sculley had negotiated with Bill Gates for Windows 1 @.@ 0 . The decision was upheld on appeal in 1994 , but legal disputes on this topic were still ongoing until 1997 , when the two companies came to a wide @-@ ranging agreement that included Microsoft buying non @-@ voting Apple stocks .

 The OdioWorks case was one of the first high @-@ profile cases illustrating Apple 's attempts to employ federal police power in its litigation practices by invoking the anti @-@ circumvention provisions of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act ( DMCA ) as a means of shielding its intellectual property from reverse engineering .

In April 2009 , OdioWorks , the operators of BluWiki , backed by the Electronic Frontier Foundation ( EFF ) , defensively sued Apple seeking a declaration of non @-@ infringement and non @-@ circumvention . In July 2009 , Apple ceased claiming infringement , stating it was " withdrawing [ Apple 's ] takedown notifications " and that " Apple no longer has , nor will it have in the future , any objection to the publication of the <unk> Pages which are the subject of the OdioWorks complaint " . After Apple withdrew its complaint and cited code obsolescence as a contributing factor in its decision to withdraw , BluWiki then republished its discussion of the issue . The EFF noted , " While we are glad that Apple retracted its baseless legal threats , we are disappointed that it only came after 7 months of censorship and a lawsuit " .

Features Digital removed from GEM as a result of the lawsuit included disk drive icons on the desktop , movable and resizable windows in the file manager , shading in the title bars , and window open / close animations .

 In a dispute illustrating the nature of claims , defenses , and counterclaims for patent infringement based on arguments of prior art and first to file , rival digital music player maker Creative Technology sued Apple in May 2006 for Apple 's alleged infringement of Creative 's Zen patent claiming Apple infringed Creative 's patent for the <unk> structures on an MP3 player . Creative claimed it began using its <unk> method on its Nomad players in September 2000 , approximately a year prior to Apple 's first iPod release in October 2001 . Creative , a Singapore @-@ based consumer electronics group , also filed a trade complaint with the United States International Trade Commission ( ITC ) against Apple . Creative asked for a court injunction to block the import and sale of Apple 's iPod and iPod nano in the United States and for money damages for past sales . Apple filed a countersuit against Creative on similar grounds . 
 In August 2006 , Apple and Creative settled the suit with Apple agreeing to pay Creative $ 100 million USD for the right to implement Creative 's method of sorting songs on the iPod . The settlement effectively ended the patent dispute and five other pending lawsuits between the two companies . Creative also secured an agreement to participate in the " Made for iPod " program by producing accessories for the iPod .

 In June 2008 , Apple was named among others as a defendant in a suit brought by plaintiff Typhoon Touch Technologies in the federal U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas alleging patent infringement in portable touch screen technology . The suit illustrated the vagaries of litigating patent licensing and royalty collection issues in the commercial exploitation of intellectual property rights . Ultimately , Typhoon could not prevail against patent defense arguments of prior art and obviousness and earned itself a reputation as a patent troll . Typhoon acquired two pre @-@ existing patents , ( filed in 1993 and 1994 and issued in 1995 and 1997 ) , in mid @-@ 2007 for $ 350 @,@ 000 plus a percentage of collected licensing fees . The patents had languished for some time and were not being policed ; shortly after Typhoon acquired the patents , it began enforcement by bringing suit against <unk> of the technology who had not paid licensing fees . Typhoon was successful in its patent infringement suits against some small companies , and then expanded its litigation to go after larger ones . Typhoon alleged that Apple and others used its patented technology inventions without permission . Typhoon originally filed the suit in December 2007 against Dell after settling with some smaller companies but , in mid @-@ 2008 , amended its complaint to add Apple , Fujitsu , Toshiba , Lenovo , Panasonic , HTC , Palm , Samsung , Nokia , and LG . In 2010 , Apple settled with Typhoon for an undisclosed sum and was then dismissed from the litigation as of September 2010 . The other large companies were able to rebuff Typhoon 's claims , and Typhoon ceased doing business in 2008 after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) suspended its trading in a fraud investigation .

 In October 2009 , Nokia Corporation sued Apple for Apple 's infringement of Nokia 's patents relating to wireless technology ; Apple countersued Nokia in December 2009 . The two companies engaged in nearly two @-@ years of litigation and both parties amended their claims multiple times and in multiple courts before finally settling in June 2011 . For an undisclosed amount of cash and future ongoing iPhone royalties to be paid by Apple , Nokia agreed to settle , with Apple 's royalty payments retroactively back @-@ payable to the iPhone 's introduction in 2007 , but with no broad cross @-@ licensing agreement made between the companies . Apple only agreed to cross @-@ license some patents to Nokia .

 Apple filed a patent infringement suit against High Tech Computer Corp. ( HTC ) in March 2010 in the U.S. District Court for the District of Delaware in the two companies ' ongoing battle with each other , and a complaint against HTC under Section 337 of the Tariff Act of 1930 with the U.S. International Trade Commission ( ITC ) in Washington , D.C. Apple 's suit alleged 20 separate patent infringements relating to the iPhone 's user interface , underlying architecture and hardware . Steve Jobs exclaimed " We can sit by and watch competitors steal our patented inventions , or we can do something about it . We 've decided to do something about it ... [ We ] think competition is healthy , but competitors should create their own original technology , not steal ours " . The ITC rejected all but one of Apple 's claims , however , ruling for Apple on a single claim relating to data tapping . HTC motioned the Delaware court for a change of venue to the Northern District of California , arguing against Apple 's desire to consolidate the case with the similar cases brought by Nokia against Apple , alleging insubstantial overlap between those cases and Apple 's complaint , but Judge Gregory M. Sleet denied HTC 's motion for a venue change , ruling that Apple 's choice of forum would prevail . HTC countersued Apple in September 2011 in the same court claiming infringement of four patents HTC obtained from Google , also filing a counter @-@ complaint with the ITC , with HTC 's general counsel saying " HTC will continue to protect its patented inventions against infringement from Apple until such infringement stops . " In May 2012 the Delaware court ordered mediation between the companies . In November 2012 , HTC and Apple ended the patent dispute by settling the case , but did not disclose the terms of the settlement . The companies reported the settlement included a 10 @-@ year agreement for licensing both companies ' current and future patents to each other . "

 Eastman Kodak sued Apple and Research In Motion ( RIM ) in January 2010 , filing two lawsuits against Apple and a complaint with the U.S. International Trade Commission against both Apple and RIM after the companies refused to pay royalties for use of Kodak 's patents for digital cameras . Kodak alleged Apple 's and RIM 's phones infringed on patented Kodak digital imaging technology . Kodak sought an injunction against further imports into the United States of Apple 's iPhone and RIM 's BlackBerry . After Kodak filed an additional suit in January 2012 against Apple and another against HTC claiming infringement of four of its key patents , Apple filed a countersuit with the U.S. Bankruptcy Court to block Kodak 's efforts to use the disputed patents as collateral for loans . In the January complaint Kodak claimed violations of the same image preview technology at issue in the original dispute between Kodak , Apple , and RIM that is , as of 2012 , pending before ITC . In March 2012 , bankruptcy court judge Allen Gropper , overseeing Kodak 's restructuring , denied Apple 's request to file a patent complaint with the ITC over some of Kodak 's cameras , photo frames , and printers . In July 2012 , the Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit ruled that Kodak did not infringe on Apple 's patent technology for digital cameras , although a few days earlier Kodak lost its case before the ITC against Apple and RIM ; Kodak announced it would appeal that decision . 
 = = = = Motorola Mobility v. Apple = = = = 
 In the year before Apple and Samsung began suing each other on most continents , and while Apple and HTC were already embroiled in a patent fight , Motorola Mobility and Apple started a period of intense patent litigation . The Motorola @-@ Apple patent imbroglio commenced with claims and cross @-@ claims between the companies for patent infringement and encompassed multiple forums in multiple countries as each party sought friendly venues for litigating its respective claims ; the fight also included administrative law rulings as well as ITC and European Commission involvement . As of April 2012 , the controversy centered on whether a <unk> license to a components manufacturer carries over to an equipment manufacturer incorporating the component into equipment , an issue not addressed in the U.S. Supreme Court 's default exhaustion doctrine in Quanta v. LG Electronics . In June 2012 , appellate Judge Richard Posner ordered dismissal of the case with prejudice and Apple announced its intention to appeal a month later . 
 = = = = Apple v. Samsung : Android phones and tablets = = = = 
 Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co . , Ltd. was the first of many lawsuits between Apple and Samsung . In the spring of 2011 , Apple sued Samsung while already fully engaged in a patent war with Motorola . Apple 's multinational litigation over technology patents became known as the mobile device patent wars : Extensive litigation followed fierce competition in the global market for consumer mobile communications . 
 By August 2011 , Apple and Samsung were engaged in 19 ongoing lawsuits in 12 courts in nine countries on four continents ; by October , the fight expanded to 10 countries , and by July 2012 , the two companies were embroiled in more than 50 lawsuits around the globe with billions of dollars in damages claimed between them . As of August 2013 , the ultimate cost of these patent wars to consumers , shareholders , and investors is not known . 
 A U.S. jury trial was held on July 30 , 2012 , with Apple prevailing and Samsung ordered to pay more than $ 1 billion in damages , after which Samsung stated : " This is not the final word in this case or in battles being waged in courts and tribunals around the world , some of which have already rejected many of Apple 's claims . " Judge Lucy H. Koh later decided that the jury had miscalculated $ 450 million in its initial damage assessment and ordered a retrial that commenced in November 2013 . Following a week @-@ long trial , also overseen by Judge Koh , Samsung was ordered to pay $ 600 million to Apple for the 2012 lawsuit . 
 On August 9 , 2013 , the U.S. International Trade Commission ( <unk> ) announced its decision regarding an Apple @-@ initiated case , whereby Samsung is accused of infringing four Apple patents related to user interfaces and headphone input functionality . The <unk> sided with Apple in what was described in the media as a " mixed ruling " and stated that some of Samsung 's older devices infringe on two of Apple 's patents — one covering touch @-@ screen technology and another regarding headphone jacks ; however , no violations were identified in four other patents . The final determination of the ITC was signed by Lisa Barton , Acting Secretary to the Commission . 
 In a damage @-@ only retrial court session on November 13 , 2013 , as ordered by Judge Koh in December 2012 , a Samsung Electronics representative stated in a San Jose , U.S. courtroom that Apple 's hometown jury found that the company copied some features of both the iPhone and iPad . Samsung 's attorney clarified the purpose of the damage @-@ only retrial and stated the result of the first trial , " This is a case not where we 're disputing that the 13 phones contain some elements of Apple 's property , " but the company has disputed the $ 379 @.@ 8 million amount that Apple claimed — Samsung presented a figure of $ 52 million . The San Jose jury eventually awarded Apple $ 290 million in damages after jurors completed a one @-@ page assessment form for each infringed patent . The six @-@ woman , two @-@ man jury reached its decision after a three @-@ day period . 
 In the first week of January 2014 , a filing with the U.S. District court in San Jose showed that legal executives from both parties agreed to meet prior to February 19 , 2014 , to engage in settlement discussions . Both Samsung and Apple were responding to a court order that instructed the completion of such a meeting before a new trial begins in March 2014 . One of three Samsung chiefs met with Cook , but the filing did not reveal the name of the representative . 
 A new trial is scheduled for March 2014 , in which Apple will seek to prevent Samsung from selling some of its current devices in the U.S. The case will involve further debate over monetary compensation . In the 2014 lawsuit , Samsung is accused of infringing five of Apple Inc . ' s patents in 10 phone and tablet models , while Samsung has responded with a counterclaim , in which it states that two patents for nine phones and tablets have been infringed on by Apple . Jury selection for the trial occurred on March 31 , 2014 . Samsung stands to gain $ 6 million if the jury rules in its favor , while Apple is seeking $ 2 billion in damages and could proceed with similar lawsuits against other Android handset makers , as the relevant patent issues extend beyond Samsung 's software technology .

 In June 2006 , the Consumer <unk> in Norway , Sweden and Denmark challenged Apple 's iTunes end user license agreement ( EULA ) through the Norwegian Consumer Ombudsman Bjørn Erik Thon , who claimed that Apple was violating contract and copyright laws in their countries . Thon stated that Apple 's " being an international company does not entitle [ it ] to disregard the laws of the countries in which it operates . The company 's standard customer contract violates Norwegian law " . An official complaint was filed by the Norwegian Consumer Council in January 2006 , after which German and French consumer groups joined the Nordic @-@ led drive to force Apple to make its iTunes online store compatible with digital music players made by rival companies . A French law allows regulators to force Apple to make its player and store compatible with rival offerings .

 In 2008 , the UK National Consumer Council ( NCC , now Consumer Focus ) called on the UK 's Office of Fair Trading ( OFT ) to investigate Apple 's EULA , claiming Apple 's EULA , and those of multiple other technology companies , misled consumers and infringed legal rights . The NCC 's product complaint included Apple 's iLife as well as Microsoft 's Office for Mac , and products by Corel , Adobe , Symantec , Kaspersky , McAfee , and others . The OFT determined the licensing agreements were unfair and Apple agreed to improve its terms and conditions to make them clearer and fairer to consumers .

That license required licensees to install Mac OS X only on Apple @-@ brand computer hardware . The case brought facets of the DMCA into a licensing dispute , with Apple ultimately prevailing and awarded permanent injunctive relief , with the decision affirmed on appeal in 2011 .

Apple claimed the order " would undermine the very freedoms and liberty our government is meant to protect " and appealed .

 = Joseph B. Foraker = 
 Joseph Benson Foraker ( July 5 , 1846 – May 10 , 1917 ) was the 37th Governor of Ohio from 1886 to 1890 and a Republican United States Senator from 1897 until 1909 . 
 Foraker was born in rural Ohio in 1846 , and enlisted at age 16 in the Union Army during the American Civil War . He fought for almost three years , attaining the rank of captain . After the war , he was a member of Cornell University 's first graduating class , and became a lawyer . Interesting himself in politics , he was elected a judge in 1879 and became well known as a political speaker . He was defeated in his first run for governor in 1883 , but was elected two years later . As governor , he built an alliance with Cleveland industrialist Mark Hanna , but fell out with him in 1888 . Foraker was defeated for re @-@ election in 1889 , but was elected United States Senator by the Ohio General Assembly in 1896 , after an unsuccessful bid for that office in 1892 . 
 In the Senate , he supported the Spanish – American War and the annexation of the Philippines and Puerto Rico ; the Foraker Act gave Puerto Rico its first civil government under American rule . He came to differ with President Theodore Roosevelt over railroad regulation and political patronage . Their largest disagreement was over the Brownsville Affair , in which black soldiers were accused of terrorizing a Texas town , and Roosevelt dismissed the entire battalion . Foraker zealously opposed Roosevelt 's actions as unfair , and fought for the soldiers ' reinstatement . The two men 's disagreement broke out into an angry confrontation at the 1907 Gridiron Dinner , after which Roosevelt worked to defeat Foraker 's re @-@ election bid . Foraker died in 1917 ; in 1972 , the Army reversed the dismissals and cleared the soldiers .

 = = = Boyhood and Civil War = = = 
 Joseph Benson Foraker was born on July 5 , 1846 , on a farm about 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) north of <unk> , Ohio , in Highland County . He was the son of Henry and Margaret ( Reece ) Foraker , and one of 11 children , of whom nine reached adulthood . Henry Foraker was the first in his line ( said to descend from Devon in England , though with German and Scots @-@ Irish influences ) to spell his name that way ; his father , named John , had spelled it as " <unk> " , or sometimes as " <unk> " . David Reece , Joseph 's maternal grandfather , was of English descent and had come from Grayson County , Virginia , to become a miller and farmer . 
 The house in which Joseph Foraker was born was a comfortable two @-@ story residence ; his later campaign publications often depicted it as a log cabin . When Joseph was age 2 , David Reece died , and the Foraker family purchased the mill and adjacent farm . There , Joseph grew up as a typical farm boy . He received little formal education , attending the local school for three or four months each winter . Nevertheless , young Joseph acquired a taste for military history , and a gift for speaking . He also became interested in politics ; at age 10 , he became an adherent of the newly formed Republican Party . Four years later , he supported the Republican candidate , former Illinois representative Abraham Lincoln , in the 1860 presidential race , marching in processions of the Wide Awakes and other pro @-@ Lincoln groups , and attending as many rallies as he could . Impressed enough by one speaker to follow him to a neighboring town , he learned not to make the same speech twice in two days — at least , not in venues close to each other . 
 In October 1861 , Foraker left his parents ' home to go to the county seat of Hillsboro where he was to live with his uncle , James Reece , auditor of Highland County , and work as a clerk in his office . He was sent to replace his older brother , Burch , by then enlisted in the Union Army as the American Civil War was raging . Foraker noted in his memoirs that while his time as auditor 's clerk greatly improved his penmanship , it also brought him into contact with many county officials , teaching him how a government worked . The young clerk was impressed by his brother 's letters home , and was anxious to join the army despite his youth . Soon after his 16th birthday , Joseph Foraker learned that a family friend was organizing a volunteer company , and sought to enlist . His uncle gave reluctant consent , and on July 14 , 1862 , Foraker was mustered in Company " A " , 89th Ohio Volunteer Infantry ; in late August , after training , he became second sergeant . With Confederate forces moving through Kentucky and threatening Cincinnati , the 89th was hurried into defenses set up across the Ohio River in Newport , Kentucky . The Confederates did not reach the Ohio , having been forced back well to the south , and the 89th moved to Fort Shaler , near Newport . While Foraker was at Fort Shaler , President Lincoln issued the Emancipation Proclamation ; Foraker recounted in his memoirs that he and his comrades felt that the proclamation meant that they were fighting for the end of slavery , not just to preserve the Union . 
 Later in September 1862 , the 89th was sent to Western Virginia ( today West Virginia ) to reinforce Union forces there , and joined in their advance for a month . The regiment settled into winter quarters , but was called out for transport to Tennessee , where it helped relieve Fort Donelson in February 1863 . Before this action , Foraker had seen little fighting , and the bloody scenes there were a shock to him ; he wrote his parents , " To know how dreadful war is you must see it yourself . " The 89th remained at Donelson only a few days before being sent to join the Army of the Cumberland under the command of Major General William Rosecrans near Carthage ; there , Foraker was promoted to second lieutenant . In June , Foraker led an advance guard that clashed with the Confederate rear in what developed into the Battle of Hoover 's Gap , and the Union forces slowly advanced across Tennessee , reaching Chattanooga in September . From Chattanooga , Foraker and two other officers were sent home to collect new soldiers who were expected to be drafted , but the plan to draft recruits was abandoned due to political opposition . In November he returned to Chattanooga , where the 89th was now part of the Army of the Tennessee under Brigadier General William Tecumseh Sherman , in time to fight in the Battle of Missionary Ridge . 
 In May 1864 , Sherman began his Atlanta Campaign . Foraker fought in a number of fierce battles in that campaign , including Resaca , New Hope Church , and Kennesaw Mountain . Atlanta , or at least what was left of it after devastating fires , fell on September 2 . Foraker was detailed to the Signal Corps school that had been set up by the army at Atlanta , and spent a month there . He was then assigned to Major General Henry W. Slocum 's division , and remained with that division as it participated in Sherman 's March to the Sea , leaving a swath of destruction behind . In late December 1864 , the army reached Savannah , and Foraker , despite a storm , was able to communicate with US Navy ships offshore to alert them to the presence of Sherman 's army . After a month , the army marched north into South Carolina , determined to bring even more devastation to the state that had first seceded . Foraker was in charge of maintaining signals between the wings of the army , and was stationed on a gunboat as it moved up the Savannah River . He saw more active duty as a courier between Sherman 's main army and Slocum 's forces in March 1865 as they met Confederate forces in North Carolina in the Battle of Bentonville . On the day of the battle , March 19 , 1865 , Foraker was promoted to brevet captain , and was soon thereafter made aide @-@ de @-@ camp to General Slocum . In April , as Sherman 's army moved slowly northward , word came of the surrender of Confederate General Robert E. Lee and his forces at Appomattox , Virginia , effectively ending the war . In early May , Sherman 's Army of Georgia journeyed north towards Washington , passing in review on May 23 before the new president , Andrew Johnson , sworn in after Lincoln 's assassination the previous month . Foraker soon thereafter returned to Ohio , and was mustered out . 
 = = = Education and early career = = = 
 Foraker had been anxious to become a lawyer while a clerk for his uncle ; with peace restored he enrolled for a year at Salem Academy and then in 1866 Ohio Wesleyan University in Delaware , Ohio . He found the students who had not served in the army to be immature . He took the usual course , mostly of classics , with a few classes in the sciences , and registered as a clerk for a local attorney . Foraker courted Julia Bundy , daughter of Congressman Hezekiah S. Bundy and a student at nearby Ohio Wesleyan Female College ; the two would marry in 1870 . In 1868 , he learned that newly founded Cornell University in Ithaca , New York , was offering entrance by examination to students willing to transfer . Along with fellow Ohio Wesleyan students Morris Lyon <unk> and John Andrew Rea , Foraker enrolled at Cornell ; the three founded the first New York State chapter of Phi Kappa Psi fraternity , and in 1869 graduated as part of Cornell 's inaugural class of eight students . Foraker , in later years , served as a trustee of Cornell , elected by his fellow alumni . 
 After graduating from Cornell , Foraker moved to Cincinnati , where he resumed his study of law with a local firm ; he was admitted to the bar in October 1869 . Foraker 's first job in the legal profession was as a notary public ; he wrote in his memoirs how time consuming depositions were in the days before typewriters . Foraker wrote that he earned $ 600 in his first year as a lawyer , but by the fourth year was earning $ 2 @,@ 700 ; " after that it was easy " . 
 The <unk> lived in a boarding house on Elm Street in Cincinnati for two years after their wedding in 1870 . They then moved to a house in the suburb of Norwood and in 1879 built a home in upscale Mount Auburn . Joseph Foraker had initially intended to concentrate on his law practice , but in the early 1870s became a well @-@ regarded speaker for the Republicans . In 1872 , Foraker campaigned for President Ulysses S. Grant 's successful re @-@ election bid . In 1875 , he was for the first time a delegate to the Republican state convention , supporting fellow Cincinnatian Alphonso Taft for governor . However , Taft was defeated for the nomination by the incumbent , Rutherford B. Hayes , who that fall broke Ohio precedent by winning a third two @-@ year term . The following year , Foraker attended the 1876 Republican National Convention as a spectator , and listened spellbound as Robert Ingersoll dramatically nominated Maine Senator James G. Blaine for president , calling him a " plumed knight " . While Ingersoll 's speech gained Blaine a lasting nickname , it did not procure him the nomination , which fell to Governor Hayes . Foraker supported Hayes , who was elected that fall in a close and controversial election . 
 In 1876 , Foraker ran for judge of the Court of Common Pleas . Election fraud by Democratic political boss Eph Howard defeated Foraker and the rest of the Republican ticket . In 1878 , he ran for state 's attorney for Hamilton County ( where Cincinnati is located ) but was defeated in another Democratic sweep . In 1879 , Foraker won his first elective office , as judge of the Superior Court of Cincinnati . He served three years of a five @-@ year term , resigning in 1882 due to an illness , though he recovered after several months ' rest . 
 = = = Seeking the governorship ( 1883 – 1885 ) = = = 
 In 1883 , Ohio Governor Charles Foster , a Republican who had held the office since 1880 , looked for a Republican contender to succeed him . Foster had sought increased regulation of the liquor trade , offending many German @-@ Americans , who were deemed likely to vote Democratic in reaction , and who were especially concentrated in Cincinnati . Few expected the Republicans to retain the governorship , and prominent candidates such as Senator John Sherman and Congressman Benjamin Butterworth declined to run . Foster saw Foraker as a candidate likely to do well : he was a Civil War veteran with a good record as a lawyer and a promising public speaker — and his Cincinnati residence might win back some votes . Others agreed ; the local United States Attorney wrote to Senator Sherman that the Republicans should nominate " Foraker or some other unobjectionable man " . Foster accordingly wrote to Foraker , offering him the chance at " honorable distinction and useful service . " Foraker came to Columbus just before the 1883 state convention , and sounded out state Republican leaders such as Sherman and Congressman William McKinley . When Foraker found them willing to support him , he allowed his name to be placed in nomination , and once it was clear that Sherman would not run , the convention nominated Foraker by acclamation . The Democratic Cincinnati Enquirer summed up the Republican strategy : " They determined to sacrifice as little as possible , so they sacrificed Foraker . " 
 The Democrats nominated George Hoadly , another Cincinnatian , with whom Foraker was friendly . The major issue in the campaign was alcohol — the legislature had passed a law authorizing localities to license saloons , and had authorized two referenda to allow additional regulation . Hoadly , though ill for part of the campaign with malaria , deftly maneuvered the politically inexperienced Foraker into stating that he would not vote for the referenda . This offended " dry " Republicans , splitting the party . Foraker campaigned throughout the state , reaching nearly every county and generally speaking at least twice a day . Nevertheless , he was defeated by over 12 @,@ 000 votes , losing most counties , including Hamilton ; according to Walters , " although defeated in this campaign , Foraker gained by it ; he won political repute through the state ; no longer was he an ' unknown . ' " One reason cited for Foraker 's defeat was a failure to appeal to blacks , who constituted about two percent of Ohio 's population and who then mostly voted Republican . 
 Foraker returned to the practice of law , initially vowing to avoid politics ; however , he received a number of letters offering him support in a gubernatorial race in 1885 . The 1884 Republican state convention elected Foraker a delegate @-@ at @-@ large to the national convention along with Congressman McKinley and Cleveland industrialist Mark Hanna . Sherman 's political managers asked Foraker to play an active role in Sherman 's presidential campaign , and to place his name in nomination at the convention , which he did , though Walters describes his speech as " weak and unimpressive " by comparison with Foraker 's later efforts . Other candidates for the presidential nomination included President Chester A. Arthur ( who had succeeded the assassinated James A. Garfield ) and John A. Logan , but the convention was dominated by the Blaine forces . Sherman received 30 votes , mostly from Ohio , on the first ballot , but his total thereafter declined , and Blaine secured the nomination on the fourth ballot . There was talk of Foraker for vice president ; he received one vote , from New York delegate and Cornell president Andrew D. White . The nominating speech , despite its flaws , made Foraker a national figure . At the convention , Foraker worked with Hanna and with Charles G. Kurtz of Columbus : both would support Foraker in the years ahead , though in the case of Hanna , only for a time . In the fall campaign , both Foraker and Hanna supported Blaine , accompanying the New Englander when he toured Ohio in October . However , Blaine was defeated by the Democratic candidate , New York Governor Grover Cleveland . 
 Foraker received early support for a second run for governor in 1885 , but said little publicly until the state convention in Springfield in June . He did , however , respond to allegations that he had discriminated against blacks in his law practice and that he had withdrawn from Ohio Wesleyan because a black student had been admitted . Foraker refuted these charges without stating that he was a candidate for office . He arrived at the convention to the strains of " Marching Through Georgia " , in reference to his Civil War service , and won an easy first @-@ ballot victory : according to Walters , " the Springfield convention of 1885 marked the arrival of Foraker , the politician . " The major issues in the fall campaign were again the liquor question , at which Foraker proved more adept than two years previously , and treatment of the black voter , prompted by an incident in Cincinnati in 1884 when a Democratic @-@ minded policeman , Mike Mullen , locked up 150 blacks the night before the general election to prevent them from voting . Foraker was again opposed by Hoadly , who had pardoned Mullen , and who had accepted a $ 150 @,@ 000 fee from the city @-@ owned Cincinnati Southern Railway , though the governor professed not to know how he had earned it . Foraker forged an alliance with black editor Harry Clay Smith , who would be a supporter throughout his political career . On October 13 , 1885 , Foraker defeated Hoadly by 17 @,@ 451 votes . Although he won much of the state , he did not carry Hamilton County due to election fraud .

 = = = Policies as governor = = = 
 Joseph Foraker was sworn in as governor on January 12 , 1886 , during an intense blizzard that prevented many of the political marching clubs hoping to honor him from reaching Columbus . In his inaugural address , he urged election reform , creation of a liquor licensing bureau , the abolition of laws that discriminated against blacks , and the establishment of a state board of health . With a Republican majority in both houses , the legislature enacted many of his proposals , including the Poorman Law , requiring voter registration in Cleveland and Cincinnati ( and later in all large cities ) , as well as the Pugsley Law , which established nonpartisan boards to appoint election officials . The Ohio State Journal commented , " Not all that is needed in the way of amendments to the election laws of Ohio , but it will do for a starter . " The Dow Law imposed an annual tax on businesses in the alcohol trade ; most of the proceeds would go for poor relief and to the police fund . With Foraker 's support , the remaining laws that allowed racial discrimination in Ohio were repealed . 
 Foraker became popular during his governorship for " waving the bloody shirt " , that is , castigating the South for the Civil War . President Cleveland in 1887 requested northern governors to return captured Confederate battle flags . When Foraker was asked by a supporter if he would allow the banners to go South , he responded by telegraph , " No rebel flags will be returned while I am governor . " Cleveland backed down , and Foraker was hailed as a hero by many , receiving thousands of congratulatory messages . Foraker criticized the President for vetoing a bill increasing war pensions and for going fishing on Decoration Day . When the governor visited Philadelphia later that year for the centennial of the Constitution , he rode at the head of a regiment of Ohio militia past the reviewing stand on which Cleveland stood . When Foraker saluted , Cleveland removed his hat , but did not bow slightly as he had for other state governors . Later that day , Foraker led a troop of Grand Army of the Republic veterans past Cleveland 's reviewing stand in another parade , bearing an array of captured battle flags . 
 Until mid @-@ 1888 , Foraker had the enthusiastic support of Hanna , who , while still boosting John Sherman for president , was a generous contributor to the governor 's 1885 and 1887 campaigns . Hanna hoped to be able to dispense patronage in northern Ohio . According to Hanna biographer William T. Horner , however , " unfortunately for Hanna , Foraker largely refused to grant Hanna the authority that by tradition he probably had earned . " One example , later cited by Foraker as a reason his close relationship with Hanna ended , was the question of the position of state oil inspector , whose substantial fees were paid , not by the taxpayer , but by the oil companies , and who was permitted to appoint large numbers of deputies . In 1885 , soon after Foraker 's inauguration , Hanna advocated the appointment of William M. Bayne , while Congressman McKinley pressed the name of Edwin Hartshorn . Hanna agreed to withdraw Bayne , not to accommodate McKinley , but to save Foraker from a difficulty . Hanna wrote to Foraker , " I had a call from Major McKinley and his oil inspector candidate . ... I tell him he ' wants the earth ' ... " However , Foraker instead reappointed the incumbent , Louis <unk> . One of the men appointed deputy oil inspector was Harry Smith , the black editor who had supported Foraker in the 1885 election . McKinley again approached Foraker after his re @-@ election in 1887 seeking Hartshorn 's appointment ; however , Foraker appointed George B. Cox , Republican boss of Cincinnati , as chief though <unk> was retained as a deputy . In later years , Foraker suggested the dispute over the oil <unk> was a reason for Hanna breaking from him and allying with McKinley , stating after Hanna 's death in 1904 , " I have often thought since that my appointment of Cox made McKinley president . "

 Walters traces fissures between Foraker 's supporters and those of Sherman from as early as 1887 . Foraker 's meteoric rise in Ohio politics was a threat to Sherman , especially as Foraker was likely to seek another office after completing his time as governor . In 1887 , McKinley , Hanna , Sherman , and others met at the congressman 's home in Canton and decided to push for Sherman 's endorsement for president by the 1887 Republican state convention in Toledo , and to threaten Foraker should he refuse to get in line . Despite some anti @-@ Sherman feeling in Ohio , the resolution to endorse Sherman was adopted unanimously by the same convention that renominated Foraker , and later that year , the governor was re @-@ elected . 
 Sherman was a leading candidate for the 1888 Republican presidential nomination , commanding the support of Ohio , much of Pennsylvania , and the South . Uncertainty over whether Blaine would be a candidate hung over the 1888 Republican National Convention in June in Chicago . Although Blaine had stated he was not running , his devotees hoped he might change his mind . Sherman did not fully trust Foraker , and gave over the management of his campaign to Hanna ; the presidential candidate also declined to have Foraker place his name in nomination in favor of Daniel H. Hastings of Pennsylvania . At the convention , Foraker seconded Hastings ' nomination of Sherman , but the senator , on the first ballot , received few votes outside the states known to back him . Sherman 's southern support was discounted , as those states would not vote for the Republican nominee , and Sherman had paid the travel expenses of those delegates , who were for the most part black . 
 By the fourth ballot , on Saturday , June 23 , Sherman had about the same number of votes he had started with , but was being challenged by a surge from former Indiana senator Benjamin Harrison . The convention then adjourned until Monday , June 25 . With almost two days for intrigue , rumors swept through the convention that Blaine would be a candidate after all . Late on Saturday night , Foraker released a statement that he would support Blaine . Walters proffered several reasons for the switch : Foraker felt Sherman had no chance , resented not being thanked by Sherman for the seconding speech , and was annoyed at the trickle of votes McKinley had received , feeling that the congressman was being prepared as a backup candidate for the Sherman forces . There was also talk that Foraker might gain a place on the ticket , either for president or vice president , though he stated he would not accept a nomination without Sherman 's consent . The switch wounded Sherman 's candidacy by showing that his own state 's governor did not support him , and even though Foraker switched back to Sherman when Blaine wired reiterating that he was not a candidate , the damage was done ; Harrison gained the nomination on the eighth ballot . 
 According to Horner , Foraker 's temporary abandonment of Sherman was " the move that seems to have shattered his relationship with Hanna permanently " . However , Foraker gave other reasons for the break , stating after Hanna 's death that one reason for it was that Hanna bought up the extra tickets of black Southern convention delegates , a practice that the governor considered corrupt . J.B. Morrow , the newspaper publisher who took Foraker 's statement as source material for Herbert Croly 's 1912 biography of Hanna , disagreed : " it was understood at the time that his [ Foraker 's ] heart was not in Sherman 's candidacy ... his outraged feelings over Hanna 's bargaining with Southern delegates can 't be believed by me . " According to Horner , " the split between Foraker and Hanna had a profound impact on the subsequent behavior of both men , their careers in politics , and the Republican Party in Ohio , which was fractured by the dispute . " 
 Harrison was elected in November 1888 over President Cleveland . By 1889 , Foraker was openly opposed by a faction of Ohio Republicans , led by Hanna , Sherman and McKinley . Foraker felt relieved at the break , writing to a friend , " From Toledo to Chicago , my neck was under a yoke , but now I am free . " Despite the factional opposition , he sought a third term in 1889 , hoping that if Republicans kept their majority in the legislature , he could be elected to the Senate as Sherman 's junior colleague in the legislative election to be held in January 1890 . He was renominated at the 1889 state convention in Columbus on the second ballot , as the opposition to him was divided . 
 A law for the Sunday closing of saloons had been passed under Foraker ; when Cincinnati Mayor John B. Mosby proposed to enforce the law against local opposition , Foraker wired to Mosby the support of the state government . This stance alienated many anti @-@ Prohibition Republicans . Another damaging incident was Foraker 's claim , based on documents he procured that turned out to be forged , that Democratic gubernatorial candidate James E. Campbell had supported the adoption of a ballot box made by a company in which Campbell supposedly had a financial interest . The documents also bore the signatures of Sherman , McKinley , and other Foraker enemies ; they were later shown to have been taken from franked mail . Campbell was not in fact involved with the company , and the affair cost Foraker votes . A congressional committee conducted an investigation in 1891 and cleared all of those whose signatures had been reproduced . However , it blamed Foraker for using the documents without verifying their authenticity . By then , Foraker was no longer governor , having been defeated by Campbell by 10 @,@ 873 votes out of some 750 @,@ 000 cast . McKinley biographer H. Wayne Morgan noted , " Clearly Foraker acted hastily and unwisely because of his desperate fight against Campbell and his bitterness towards the <unk> . " The defeat had consequences for Foraker ; according to another of McKinley 's biographers , Kevin Phillips : " when Foraker lost his bid for a third statehouse term , McKinley became Ohio 's next @-@ in @-@ line presidential favorite son " .

 Defeated for re @-@ election , Foraker returned to Cincinnati and the practice of law . Although initially he rejoined his old law partnership , he established his own offices in 1893 , the year his son Joseph Jr. became an assistant in his office upon graduation from Cornell . Joseph Benson Foraker Jr. was the first child of a Cornell alumnus to graduate from the university . The senior Foraker , though he accepted a broad array of cases , was a " political lawyer " , lobbying the legislature to grant franchises to his clients , and arranging for bills unfavorable to his clients ( who included the Edison Electric Company , Cincinnati Bell Telephone Company , and the Cincinnati Street Railway Company ) to be quashed . 
 The former governor was enraged when in March 1890 , Hanna gave a speech in New York stating , " Foraker is dead as a factor in our politics and Ohio is again as reliable a Republican state as it ever was . " Foraker determined to secure election to the Senate ; although the Democratic @-@ controlled legislature had elected Calvin S. Brice to the Senate in 1890 , Sherman 's seat would be up for election in January 1892 . McKinley was defeated for re @-@ election to Congress in November 1890 ; his stature in Ohio politics was not diminished by the loss , as he was seen as a victim of gerrymandering . When the former congressman ran for governor the following year , he asked Foraker to place his name in nomination , which he did . Although some saw this as a rapprochement between the Sherman and Foraker factions , the former governor 's supporters , such as Kurtz and millionaire Springfield manufacturer Asa Bushnell , were already campaigning for Foraker for Senate . 
 McKinley was elected governor in November 1891 , and the Republicans took a two @-@ thirds majority in the legislature . During the campaign , supporters of both Foraker and Sherman had sought pledges from candidates , and in the aftermath of the legislative elections , both men expressed confidence . Sherman was handicapped by his age ( 68 ) , unpopularity , and a cold personality ; according to Horner , " Foraker was simply more of a man of the people than Sherman could ever hope to be . " Sherman 's aide , Jacob C. Donaldson , later wrote , " the situation was bad , almost desperate " . Hanna had made significant campaign contributions to legislative candidates , and was outraged when legislators believed to favor Sherman instead announced that they would vote for Foraker ; according to his biographer , Herbert Croly , " The situation looked desperate ; but it was saved , so Mr. Sherman himself stated to his friends , by Mr. Hanna 's energy , enthusiasm and ability to bend other men to his will . Three of the Cleveland representatives , who had gone into hiding , were unearthed and forced into line . " Donaldson noted , " Several of them were ruined by their perfidy . " Foraker was defeated narrowly in the Republican caucus , first on a vote to hold a secret ballot ( which would have benefited him ) , and then on the endorsement vote , which supported Sherman , who was subsequently elected by the legislature . According to Horner , " It is difficult to know which mattered more to Hanna — making sure his old friend Sherman kept his job or making sure that Foraker did not get it . " 
 Sherman was not magnanimous in victory , telling friends that he would not rest until he " tomahawked the last of Foraker 's crowd " . Nevertheless , at the Republican state convention , Foraker and his supporters were able to gain their goal of half the delegates @-@ at @-@ large to the 1892 Republican National Convention in Minneapolis , free to vote as they pleased . President Harrison was seeking renomination ; other men spoken of as possible candidates were Blaine ( who had again disclaimed any interest in running ) and McKinley . Prior to the Minneapolis convention , Hanna wrote to Foraker for the first time in four years , seeking to put aside differences in support of McKinley . Foraker agreed ; he disliked Harrison and did not feel he could be re @-@ elected . McKinley finished third for the nomination , a fraction of a vote behind Blaine . Harrison was defeated by Cleveland in the November election , and McKinley was spoken of as the most likely Republican presidential contender for 1896 . 
 = = = Election to the Senate ; involvement in presidential race = = = 
 Foraker had little involvement in politics in 1893 and 1894 , concentrating on the law . He still sought a Senate seat , however , and carefully planned his strategy for the 1895 state convention in Zanesville . Foraker forces gained full control , nominating Bushnell for governor to succeed McKinley , and Foraker allies for other state offices . The convention also endorsed Foraker for Senate , the first time a specific individual had been backed for Senate by an Ohio Republican convention . According to Walters , " The Zanesville convention represented the highest <unk> of Foraker 's power in Ohio politics . He had selected the platform , chosen the next governor and the complete ticket , and had secured for himself virtual election to the United States Senate . " Foraker took a leading role as a speaker in the campaign , and the November election resulted in victory for Bushnell and a Republican majority in the legislature . That majority , on January 15 , 1896 , elected Joseph Foraker to the Senate . 
 Even before the senatorial election , the rival factions in the Ohio Republican Party were battling less than usual , but it was not until the day of the senatorial election that McKinley and Foraker reached a definite understanding for peace during the 1896 campaign . Foraker agreed to support McKinley 's presidential bid , and to travel to New York to approach that state 's Republican political boss , Senator Thomas C. Platt , hoping to gain Platt 's support for McKinley . In March , Foraker addressed the state convention in support of McKinley in a widely publicized speech . However , he was reluctant to be a delegate to the national convention , fearing that he would be blamed if anything went wrong with McKinley 's candidacy . It was only after considerable prodding from the presidential candidate that Foraker agreed to be a delegate , and to place McKinley 's name in nomination . McKinley desired that Foraker nominate him to show that he had the united support of the state Republican Party . Senator @-@ elect Foraker eventually agreed , and gave the nominating speech , part of which was heard by McKinley via telephone line to Canton . 
 The Democrats nominated former Nebraska congressman William Jennings Bryan , who had electrified the Democratic National Convention with his Cross of Gold speech . When Bryan accepted his nomination with a lengthy address in New York , the senator @-@ elect commented , " Mr. Bryan made himself by one speech , and now he has unmade himself by one speech " . Although Foraker went to Europe for four weeks ( his sole trip abroad ) , he gave almost 200 speeches for the Republicans once he returned . McKinley was elected president with a comfortable majority in the Electoral College . 
 = = Senator ( 1897 – 1909 ) = = 
 On March 4 , 1897 , the same day William McKinley became president , Joseph Foraker was sworn in as senator from Ohio . The new legislator was escorted to the bar of the Senate by Sherman ; his swearing @-@ in helped cement a modest Republican majority . Foraker continued his private legal work , which was not unusual at the time as many senators maintained business interests . Wealthy through his law practice , Foraker did not stand out in that regard either , as the " rich man 's club " of the Senate of that era contained about 25 millionaires . 
 = = = Rivalry with Hanna = = = 
 During the 1896 campaign , Hanna served as chairman of the Republican National Committee , in charge of McKinley 's campaign , and obtained millions for his presidential candidate by soliciting donations from wealthy businessmen . After the November election , Foraker met with Hanna and was surprised to learn that President @-@ elect McKinley and Hanna planned that Sherman would be appointed Secretary of State and that the industrialist would take Sherman 's place in the Senate . Foraker objected to both components of this plan , feeling that Hanna was not qualified as a legislator , and that Sherman , whose faculties were starting to fail , should not become Secretary of State . Foraker met with McKinley , but failed to convince him . 
 Bushnell ( who would get to appoint a temporary replacement ) and Foraker ( a close political ally of the governor ) did not want to appoint Hanna ; their faction had several candidates , including Bushnell himself , for the next election for Sherman 's seat in 1898 . Bushnell and Foraker resisted for a month once the pending appointment of Sherman became known in January 1897 , during which time the governor offered the seat to Congressman Theodore E. Burton , who declined . It was not until February 21 that Bushnell finally announced Hanna 's appointment , effective upon Sherman 's resignation . This controversy to some extent overshadowed Foraker 's swearing @-@ in as senator on March 4 — Hanna adherents claimed that Bushnell had delayed the effective date of the industrialist 's appointment until Foraker took his seat so that Hanna would be the junior senator . In his memoirs , Foraker denied this , noting that Sherman was unwilling to resign until the afternoon of March 4 , after the new president and Congress were sworn in and the new Cabinet , including Sherman , was confirmed by the Senate . Hanna was given his commission as senator by Bushnell on the morning of March 5 . 
 Foraker had known that with McKinley in the Executive Mansion ( as the White House was still formally known ) and Sherman expected to be senior senator , he could expect only limited patronage appointments for his supporters . With McKinley 's close friend Hanna instead in the Senate , Foraker was allowed to recommend appointees to the President , but McKinley allowed Hanna to exercise a veto over Foraker 's candidates . 
 Foraker was not visibly involved in the unsuccessful efforts to deny Hanna re @-@ election in 1898 , but several of his allies , including Bushnell and Kurtz , were part of the opposition . Foraker nominated McKinley again at the 1900 convention ; his florid praise of the president pleased the delegates . As McKinley 's original vice president , Garret Hobart , had died in 1899 , he required a new running mate for the 1900 campaign , and the convention chose the popular Spanish – American War hero , New York Governor Theodore Roosevelt . Foraker had maintained friendly relations with Roosevelt since the two men met at the 1884 convention , but Hanna bitterly opposed the choice . Foraker spoke widely during McKinley 's successful re @-@ election campaign . 
 After President McKinley was assassinated in September 1901 , Foraker attended the funeral services and addressed a large memorial meeting at the Cincinnati Music Hall . When politics resumed after the mourning , Foraker spoke in defense of President Roosevelt 's inviting Booker T. Washington , a black man , to the White House . This helped ensure support from the black community in Foraker 's successful re @-@ election bid in January 1902 , which was not opposed by the Hanna faction . 
 Both Hanna and Foraker had been spoken of as possible Republican presidential candidates in 1904 ; with President Roosevelt now likely to be the nominee , both men 's presidential ambitions were pushed back four years . Hanna in particular was reluctant to publicly put aside his presidential candidacy , believing that keeping it alive would help assure his re @-@ election by the legislature in 1904 . In 1903 , Foraker saw an opportunity to embarrass Hanna and boost his own chances for 1908 by getting the Republican state convention to pass a resolution endorsing Roosevelt for re @-@ election . If Hanna supported the resolution , he made it clear he would not be a candidate ; if he opposed it , he risked Roosevelt 's wrath . Hanna sent Roosevelt a telegram that he would oppose the resolution ; Roosevelt replied that he expected his administration 's supporters to vote for such a resolution , and Hanna gave in . 
 In February 1904 , Hanna died of typhoid fever , and his Senate seat and factional leadership were won by Charles Dick , a four @-@ term congressman who had received favorable publicity due to his Spanish – American War service . Dick was able to work out an accommodation with Foraker 's faction and was thereafter considered the leader of Ohio 's Republican " stand @-@ patters " , who saw no immediate need for social change . 
 = = = War and territorial gain = = = 
 In the year between his swearing @-@ in and the 1898 Spanish – American War , Foraker was an enthusiastic supporter of Cuban independence from Spain . A special session of Congress , called at the request of President McKinley , met beginning in March 1897 to consider new tariff legislation ; hawkish senators , including Foraker ( who was made a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee ) , took the opportunity to press resolutions in support of the Cuban insurgents . Foraker was impatient with McKinley 's policy towards Spain , decrying the President 's State of the Union communication to Congress in December 1897 and his so @-@ called " war message " , which some deemed insufficiently bellicose , in April 1898 . The senator stated to a reporter of the latter , " I have no patience with the message and you may say so . I have heard nothing but condemnation of the message on all hands . " 
 Foraker had introduced a resolution calling for Spain to withdraw from Cuba , and for the recognition of the rebels as the legitimate government of an independent Cuba . The resolution that passed Congress in April called for all those things except recognition ( deleted at the request of the administration ) and authorized the President to use force to achieve those aims . McKinley 's signature on the joint resolution caused Spain to break off diplomatic relations and war was quickly declared . Foraker followed the war closely — his elder son was fighting in it — and was an early proponent of the US keeping Spanish colonies it had captured , such as the Philippines and Puerto Rico . 
 McKinley had attempted to annex Hawaii , but the annexation treaty failed to be ratified by the Senate . Congressional leaders decided to try again , this time using a joint resolution that would bypass the need for a two @-@ thirds vote in the Senate . The American victory at the Battle of Manila Bay in early May revived interest in the Hawaiian matter . Foraker was a major proponent of the resolution in the Foreign Relations Committee and was the only committee member to speak in the debate . Opposition was mostly from Democrats , who objected to the revolution by which American interests had taken control of the islands in 1893 , a seizure defended by Foraker . In early July , proponents were able to get the resolution through both houses of Congress , and President McKinley signed it on July 8 . 
 The new American possession of Puerto Rico found itself in financial woes soon after its acquisition — its principal export , coffee , was now barred by high tariffs from both Spanish and American markets . Foraker took the lead in drafting and pressing legislation establishing a civil government for the island . Although Foraker had proposed to eliminate tariffs on imports from Puerto Rico , to secure passage of the legislation he had to accept a rate of 15 % for two years as the island developed a taxation system , after which there would be no tariff , and the money would be used to develop the island . The Foraker Act was signed by President McKinley on April 12 , 1900 . It required an American @-@ appointed governor and a legislature in which a majority of the upper house would be American @-@ appointed , and did not grant Puerto Ricans American citizenship . Foraker had wanted to give the islanders US citizenship , but neither the administration nor much of the Congress agreed with him . In 1901 , the Foraker Act was upheld by the Supreme Court , which ruled in Downes v. Bidwell that the Constitution did not apply to Puerto Rico and that Congress could legislate for it ( or , in the phrase then current , the Constitution did not follow the flag ) . 
 = = = Opposition to Roosevelt = = = 
 Foraker maintained generally friendly relations with Roosevelt in the president 's first term : lacking an electoral mandate , Roosevelt had pledged after the assassination to carry out McKinley 's policies . Elected in his own right in November 1904 , President Roosevelt felt more free to support progressive policies . When Roosevelt told Foraker his plans after the election , Foraker initially took no alarm , but according to Walters , " the resulting antagonism led to the political elimination of Foraker in 1908 . " 
 Their relationship began to break down over the question of railroad regulation . The President in 1905 sought legislation to give the Interstate Commerce Commission ( ICC ) the power to set freight rates ; Foraker considered the proposed law unconstitutional , and introduced a bill by which the railroad would set the rates , and if the ICC found they were excessive , it could ask the Attorney General to bring suit . Foraker spoke repeatedly against the administration @-@ favored bill as it moved through the Senate , and was one of only three senators ( and the only Republican ) to oppose the resulting Hepburn Act on final Senate passage . As the Ohio legislature had passed a resolution urging Foraker and Dick to vote for the bill , he faced anger at home ; one newspaper wrote that Foraker had extinguished his chances of becoming president with his vote . The following year , Foraker also broke with the administration on the question of statehood for Arizona Territory and New Mexico Territory , feeling that the two territories should not be combined into one state unless a merger was approved in referenda . Foraker 's position prevailed in Congress ; despite his stance , Roosevelt signed the resulting bill . The two men also differed on issues of patronage , and on a series of treaties requiring Senate ratification that allowed for international agreements without the need for Senate approval . Roosevelt wrote to a friend that Foraker seemed determine to fight him on every point , good or bad . 
 = = = = Brownsville case = = = = 
 On the night of August 14 , 1906 , gunshots were heard in the border town of Brownsville , Texas ; one resident was killed and a police officer wounded . Various military items , including discharged rifle shells , were presented by the local mayor as evidence that troops of the 25th Infantry Battalion , stationed outside of town and consisting of blacks , were responsible . When questioned , all denied involvement . Nevertheless , their white officers reported to the War Department that undetermined men belonging to the 25th Infantry were responsible , and that others of the battalion were aware of who had done it , but were remaining silent . Despite an almost total lack of evidence , on November 5 , 1906 ( just after the midterm congressional elections ) , Roosevelt ordered 167 soldiers dishonorably discharged and made ineligible for federal employment , including such decorated soldiers as First Sergeant Mingo Sanders , who had fought alongside Roosevelt in Cuba . The President adhered to his decision despite appeals from both whites and blacks . 
 Foraker was initially convinced of the guilt of the men , but reconsidered after evidence obtained in a private investigation by progressive organizations was presented to him ( the black attorney presenting it was denied an audience with Roosevelt ) . According to Roosevelt biographer Edmund Morris , " Foraker had a passion for racial justice . " Recalling Foraker 's desire , as a soldier , to see slavery abolished and the black man given the same civil and political rights as the white man , Morris explains , " Senator Foraker merely felt the same about the Constitution in 1906 as Private Foraker had felt in 1862 . " In addition to his desire to see justice done , Foraker also saw political advantage in opposing Roosevelt over the Brownsville issue ; he might boost his own presidential ambitions for 1908 by making both Roosevelt and his designated heir apparent , Secretary of War William Howard Taft , look bad . 
 Foraker battled to have the Senate investigate the Brownsville case , and got the body to pass a resolution requiring Taft to turn over information . By late January 1907 , after further investigation , Roosevelt had rescinded the part of the order barring the soldiers from federal employment , and had stated that he would reconsider the case of anyone who could present proof of his innocence . Foraker had claimed that the president lacked the authority to discharge the men ; to get a resolution passed for an investigatory committee , he had to withdraw that assertion . 
 Matters came to a head at the Gridiron Dinner on January 27 ; the program showed cartoons of the leading attendees and accompanying verses . Foraker 's read " All coons look alike to me " , suggesting his Brownsville stance was to attract the black vote . According to Walters , " the jests had been pointed and the cartoons biting " ; Roosevelt was seen to be angry . Nevertheless , when the President rose to speak , all that was expected was a few minutes of humorous comments . Instead , in his speech , Roosevelt attacked Foraker and defended his own conduct in the Brownsville case . Although it was not customary to permit anyone to follow a president 's speech , Foraker was allowed to reply . The Washington Post reported that Foraker " gave the President the plainest talk he has probably ever listened to . " Foraker stated that Sergeant Sanders had been dishonorably discharged even though " he was as innocent of any offense against the law of any kind whatever as the President himself " — and , he charged , Roosevelt was fully aware the soldiers had been wronged . He denied that he was after votes with his position , " I was seeking to provide for those men an opportunity to be heard in their own defense , to give them a chance to confront their accusers and cross @-@ examine their witnesses , and establish the real facts in the case . " Roosevelt spoke in angry rebuttal , but according to his biographer Morris , " Never before , at the Gridiron or anywhere else , had a President been challenged before an audience . " 
 = = = 1908 defeat for re @-@ election = = = 
 In the aftermath of the Gridiron Dinner , Foraker was increasingly ostracized , both politically and socially . <unk> at the White House , he was excluded from patronage . Nevertheless , the Committee on Military Affairs , on which Foraker sat , went ahead and held hearings into the Brownsville matter between February and June 1907 . Author John Weaver , in his 1997 book on the Brownsville case , takes note of " Foraker 's masterful presentation of fact and law " , including his cross @-@ examination of witnesses who sought to convince the committee of the soldiers ' guilt . In March 1908 , the committee issued its report , by a vote of 9 – 4 endorsing the President 's action . While the official minority report found the evidence inconclusive , Foraker and Connecticut Senator Morgan Bulkeley signed a separate report stating that " the weight of the testimony shows that none of the soldiers of the Twenty @-@ fifth U.S. Infantry participated in the shooting affray " . 
 Although he knew he had little chance of winning , Foraker challenged Taft , his fellow Cincinnatian , for the Republican nomination for president . He hoped to secure a deal whereby he would endorse Taft in exchange for support in the senatorial election to be held in January 1909 . Roosevelt was determined to drive Foraker from politics , and Taft refused to deal . Taft won at each stage of the delegate @-@ selection process , gaining all but two delegates from Ohio . At the 1908 Republican National Convention , Taft received 702 votes and was nominated ; Foraker received 16 , of which 11 came from blacks . 
 After failing to capture the Republican presidential nomination , Foraker concentrated on campaigning for re @-@ election to the Senate . His vote on the Hepburn Act and his opposition to Roosevelt had provoked opposition to him within the Ohio Republican Party ; in addition , both he and Dick were seen by some as the face of the old guard of the party , out of place in the Progressive Era . Many of those who opposed him proposed Congressman Theodore E. Burton for the Senate seat ; Foraker stated that the first thing to do was secure a Republican legislature , with the question of who should be senator left until victory was obtained . 
 Amid speculation as to Taft 's position on Foraker , the two men met , to all appearances cordially , on September 2 at the Grand Army of the Republic encampment at Toledo , and later that day , the two men appeared on the same platform . Taft spoke in appreciation of Foraker , who , as governor , had appointed him as a judge , giving him his start in public life . Foraker , for his part , stated that Taft would be his party leader during the campaign , and called on the presidential candidate at his headquarters in Cincinnati a week later . The Taft campaign asked Foraker to preside , and to introduce Taft , at a rally to be held at the Cincinnati Music Hall on September 22 . In a letter to a newspaper publisher , Taft pointed out that Foraker " can be useful with the colored vote and the Grand Army vote " . 
 The seeming rapprochement was shattered when publisher William Randolph Hearst , giving a speech in Columbus , read from letters to Foraker by Standard Oil Company vice president John D. Archbold . During Foraker 's first term in the Senate , he had done legal work for Standard Oil . In the letters , Archbold referred to legislation he considered objectionable , and also mentioned the substantial fees to Foraker . The publisher suggested the fees were a bribe for the killing of the legislation . Foraker quickly denied any impropriety , stating that the relationship was not secret and the excerpts had been read out of context . Foraker noted that when he was retained by the corporation in December 1898 , it had not yet come under federal scrutiny , and when Archbold had sought to retain him in 1906 , he had declined . Standard Oil was wildly unpopular , and the controversy put Taft in a difficult position . Foraker sent a letter to Taft , hand @-@ delivered by Senator Dick , expressing his willingness to avoid the Music Hall meeting . Taft said only that he hoped Foraker would meet with the organizers of the event and follow their recommendation , which Foraker took to mean that Taft was giving credence to Hearst 's charges and did not want him there . Foraker cancelled all remaining campaign speeches . Ohio helped elect Taft and elected a Democratic governor , but returned a Republican legislature , which would elect a senator in January 1909 . 
 Through December , Foraker worked to try to retain his Senate seat , which required action by the Ohio legislature in the era before direct election of senators . His rivals were Burton and the President @-@ elect 's brother , former congressman Charles Phelps Taft , though near the end of the contest , former lieutenant governor Warren G. Harding asked for his name to be considered . Both Foraker and Burton opposed Charles Taft 's call for a caucus of the Republican legislators to determine the party 's candidate . On December 29 , President Roosevelt weighed in on the question . Roosevelt " lost no time in putting the Republican members of the Ohio legislature on notice that to re @-@ elect Mr. Foraker to the Senate would be regarded as nothing less than treason to the party " . Roosevelt accused Foraker of seeking to make a bargain with the Democrats to secure his re @-@ election in exchange for a Democratic replacement for Dick in 1911 . Faced with this presidential intervention and Charles Taft 's withdrawal from the race , Foraker saw no path to victory and conceded on December 31 . The Republican caucus two days later selected Burton , whom the legislators duly selected on January 12 . 
 Foraker continued to work on Brownsville in his remaining time in office , guiding a resolution through Congress to establish a board of inquiry with the power to reinstate the soldiers . The bill , which the administration did not oppose , was less than Foraker wanted . He had hoped for a requirement that unless specific evidence was shown against a man , he would be allowed to re @-@ enlist . The legislation passed both houses and was signed by Roosevelt on March 2 , 1909 . On March 6 , 1909 , shortly after he left the Senate , Joseph Foraker was the guest of honor at a mass meeting at Washington 's Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church . Though both whites and blacks assembled to recognize the former senator , all the speakers were blacks , save Foraker . Presented with a silver loving cup , he addressed the crowd , 
 I have said that I do not believe that a man in that battalion had anything to do with the shooting up of " Brownsville " , but whether any one of them had , it was our duty to ourselves as a great , strong , and powerful nation to give every man a hearing , to deal fairly and squarely with every man ; to see to it that justice was done to him ; that he should be heard . 
 = = Final years = = 
 As with his defeat for governor twenty years earlier , Foraker returned after losing re @-@ election to Cincinnati and the full @-@ time practice of law . He found a number of well @-@ paying corporations willing to retain him as counsel . Foraker represented the American <unk> Company before the Supreme Court , seeking to overturn a Taft @-@ backed law imposing an excise tax on corporations . Several cases were consolidated into Flint v. Stone Tracy Company ( 1911 ) , in which the Supreme Court upheld the law . 
 Although he expressed bitterness upon leaving office , wishing he had never left the farm in Highland County , he soon resumed his involvement in politics , speaking for the unsuccessful Republican candidate for governor , Harding , in 1910 . The gubernatorial candidate had previously supported Foraker , though he had backed Taft in 1908 . In 1912 , Foraker made speeches in support of Taft 's re @-@ election bid , although he felt he had been badly treated by Taft in 1908 . Foraker refused , however , to attack the third @-@ party candidate , former president Roosevelt , whose candidacy split the party and led to the election of Democrat Woodrow Wilson . 
 In 1913 , ratification of the Seventeenth Amendment to the United States Constitution changed the method of choosing senators from legislative vote to election by the people . Buoyed by positive reviews of his participation in the 1912 campaign , and wishing to avenge his defeat for re @-@ election , Foraker entered the 1914 Republican primary against Senator Burton and former congressman Ralph D. Cole . When Burton withdrew , Foraker became the favorite . However , Foraker had made enemies , and others believed that his " old guard " Republicanism was out of date , Harding was reluctant , but was eventually persuaded to enter the primary . Although Harding did not attack Foraker , his supporters , including Cleveland publisher Dan R. Hanna ( son of the late senator ) , had no such scruples . Harding won the primary with 88 @,@ 540 votes to 76 @,@ 817 for Foraker and 52 @,@ 237 for Cole , and subsequently won the general election . Harding sent Foraker a letter regretting the primary result , but Foraker was more bitter towards the electorate , feeling they returned ingratitude for his previous public service . 
 With his political career at an end , Foraker began work on his memoirs , Notes of a Busy Life , published in 1916 . Roosevelt , after reading Foraker 's autobiography , wrote that he regretted his attacks . Roosevelt concluded his letter with an invitation to visit him at his home in New York . Foraker treasured this letter , which he felt re @-@ established his friendship with Roosevelt , although the two men did not meet in the short time remaining to Foraker . 
 Foraker supported President Wilson as he moved the nation closer to intervention in World War I. In April 1917 , Foraker was one of a group of Cincinnatians who organized to support Wilson when the President asked Congress to declare war on Germany . The former senator 's ill @-@ health ( he had suffered several heart attacks during the preceding winter ) limited his participation . On May 7 , Foraker experienced another heart attack in downtown Cincinnati . Taken home , he lapsed in and out of consciousness for three days before dying on May 10 , 1917 . Hundreds of prominent Cincinnatians attended his interment at Spring Grove Cemetery on May 13 . 
 = = Assessment = = 
 Historian Allan Nevins , in his foreword to Walters ' biography of Foraker , suggested that Foraker did not attain the presidency , as he had hoped , because of the ambitions of other Ohio politicians . While Foraker might have secured the nomination in 1888 as a compromise candidate , had not his pledges to Sherman prevented it , having " stood aside for an older man [ , ] year after year he was compelled to stand aside for younger leaders . First McKinley , with Hanna at his side , was given precedence ; then Taft , whom Foraker had given a start in public life , scaled the peak . Foraker , for all his administrative capacity , his wide popular appeal , and his unflinching courage , had the tragic lot of seeing a succession of associates go above him . " Even Foraker 's final defeat , in 1914 , proved to be part of the political rise of another president from Ohio , Harding . Nevins noted the aggressive nature of Foraker 's political style , and commented , " How much of his failure to reach high office was attributable to ill fortune and how much to some of his traits , readers … may judge for themselves . " Cincinnati editor Murat Halstead , a contemporary , attributed the fact that Foraker did not get nominated in 1888 to the surplus of ambitious Ohio men at the convention : in addition to Sherman , Foraker , and McKinley , even Harrison had been born in Ohio . 
 According to Nevins , " in the era which began after McKinley 's assassination he did not show the progressive qualities which the electorate increasingly demanded ; indeed , he seemed positively reactionary . " Walters agreed , noting that Foraker 's 1914 defeat was caused in part by fears that his " uncompromising Republicanism of an earlier era would injure the party . The stirring principles of the New Freedom called for new leaders . " Historian Benjamin Kendrick noted that " Mr. Foraker was among the first of prominent politicians to be retired because of their too close connection with ' Big Business . ' " 
 Historian Louis L. Gould , who wrote a study of the McKinley administration , stated that Foraker " may well have been too close to some large corporations , but he also retained some vestiges of the commitment of the Civil War generation in the North to the idea of human equality ... This prompted him to champion the cause of the Negro soldiers . " According to historian Percy Murray in his journal article on the relationship between Foraker and black newspaper editor Harry Smith , Foraker 's " political career ended partially because of his support for and espousal of black rights ... Perhaps Smith best summed up his alliance with Foraker when he stated that it was time for Afro @-@ Americans to ... show full support for Foraker and men like him who supported the efforts of Afro @-@ Americans . " Walter Rucker and James Upton , in their Encyclopedia of American Race Riots , write favorably of Foraker : 
 Senator Foraker is acknowledged as the key person in Congress to keep the issue of the Brownsville soldiers alive . He made speeches about it and wrote about it . His statement in defense of the soldiers was summed up appropriately when he said that the soldiers " ask [ ed ] no favors because they are Negroes , but only justice because they are men " . 
 = Jim Baxter = 
 James Curran Baxter ( 29 September 1939 – 14 April 2001 ) was a left @-@ footed Scottish footballer who played as a left half . He is generally regarded as one of the country 's greatest ever players . He was born , educated and started his career in Fife , but his peak playing years were in the early 1960s with the Glasgow club Rangers , whom he helped to win ten trophies between 1960 and 1965 , and where he became known as " Slim Jim " . However , he started drinking heavily during a four @-@ month layoff caused by a leg fracture in December 1964 , his fitness suffered , and he was transferred to Sunderland in summer 1965 . In two and a half years at Sunderland he played 98 games and scored 12 goals , becoming known for drinking himself unconscious the night before a match and playing well the next day . At the end of 1967 Sunderland transferred him to Nottingham Forest , who gave him a free transfer back to Rangers in 1969 after 50 games . After a further year with Rangers Baxter retired from football in 1970 , at the age of 31 . 
 From 1961 to 1967 , he was a leading member of a strong Scottish international team that lost only once to England , in 1965 , shortly after he recovered from the leg fracture . He thought his best international performance was a 2 – 1 win against England in 1963 , when he scored both goals after Scotland were reduced to 10 players – left back Eric <unk> had his leg broken in a tackle with Bobby Smith . In the 1967 match against England , who had won the 1966 World Cup , he taunted the opposition by ball juggling while waiting for his team @-@ mates to find good positions . Although he was given most of the credit for the 3 – 2 win , some commentators wished he had made an effort to run up a bigger score . 
 In his prime , Baxter was known for his ability to raise a team 's morale , his good tactical vision , precise passing and ability to send opponents the wrong way – and for being a joker on the pitch . He also broke with Glasgow tradition by becoming friendly with several members of their major Glasgow rivals , Celtic . 
 Although he gained a reputation as a womaniser when he moved to Glasgow , he married in 1965 and had two sons . The marriage broke up in 1981 , and in 1983 he formed another relationship that lasted the rest of his life . After retiring from football he became manager of a pub , and his continued heavy drinking damaged his liver so badly that he needed two transplants at the age of 55 , after which he swore off alcohol . Baxter was also addicted to gambling , and is estimated to have lost between £ 250 @,@ 000 and £ 500 @,@ 000 . After he died of pancreatic cancer in 2001 , his funeral was held in Glasgow Cathedral and his ashes were buried at Rangers ' Ibrox Stadium . In 2003 , a statue was erected in his honour at his hometown , Hill of Beath . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Baxter was born in Hill of Beath , Fife , on 29 September 1939 and was educated and started his career there . After leaving school he spent eight months as an apprentice cabinet maker , and then worked as a coal miner . 
 His former headmaster James Carmichael took an interest in ex @-@ pupils and encouraged Baxter to join local football team <unk> Juveniles instead of one of the glamour clubs . Baxter went on to play for the Fife junior team , Crossgates Primrose . Baxter joined Raith Rovers as a part @-@ timer in 1957 . He later said of his time with the two Fife clubs , " I would never have made it in today 's circumstances . I needed bastards like Carmichael , <unk> , Ferrier , Herdman and McNaught . Young players like I was would simply tell them to get stuffed and take their talent elsewhere . I owe them . "

 Baxter joined Raith Rovers as a part @-@ timer in 1957 . 
 In June 1960 , he joined the Glasgow team Rangers for a transfer fee of £ 17 @,@ 500 , a Scottish record at the time . 
 His first two seasons at Ibrox were coupled with two years ' National service as a Black Watch soldier . 
 Baxter played for Rangers from 1960 to 1965 , mainly as an attacking left half . During this period the team won the Scottish League Championship in 1961 , 1963 and 1964 , and the Scottish Cup in 1964 . Rangers fans remember him as " Slim Jim " , and in 18 " Old Firm " games against local rivals Celtic – 10 Scottish League , five Scottish League Cup and three Scottish Cup matches – he was only twice on the losing side . His first Rangers game was in August 1960 at inside left against Partick Thistle in the Scottish League Cup . He scored his first goal for the club in November 1960 , against Clyde , and in the same month scored an early goal in Rangers ' 8 – 0 win over the German team Borussia Mönchengladbach . In 1961 Baxter played in the Rangers team that contested the first ever European Cup Winners ' Cup Final , a two @-@ legged tie that they lost 4 – 1 on aggregate to Fiorentina . 
 In December 1964 , Baxter played brilliantly , in Tam Dalyell 's opinion , to set up a 2 – 0 win for Rangers in an away game against Rapid Vienna in the European Cup , but late in the game his leg was broken and he was unable to play for four months . He started drinking heavily during this lay @-@ off , and this reduced his fitness . 
 Scot Symon , the Rangers manager who had signed up Baxter in 1960 , may have felt Baxter 's best days were past , and sold him in May 1965 . 
 = = = Later career = = = 
 Baxter joined Sunderland for a transfer fee of £ 72 @,@ 500 , the highest ever paid to a Scottish club at the time . Baxter played 98 games for Sunderland in England 's First Division ( then the top tier ) , scoring 12 goals . 
 In December 1967 , Sunderland sold Baxter to English First Division club Nottingham Forest for £ 100 @,@ 000 . While there he became friends with cricketer Gary Sobers . After playing 50 games for Forest , in 1969 , Baxter was given a free transfer . 
 Baxter moved back to Rangers . His return to Rangers was brief , as he retired from football in 1970 , aged only 31 . By the end of his career with Rangers he had made 254 appearances for the club , including victories that led to three Scottish League Championships , three Scottish Cups and four Scottish League Cups . 
 = = International career = = 
 In the 1960s Baxter gained 34 caps as a member of strong Scottish teams , which included Billy McNeill , Pat Crerand , John White , Dave Mackay , Denis Law and John Greig . In his international appearances he scored three goals , and Scotland won 21 , drew 3 and lost 10 of these matches . He made his international debut in November 1961 , when Scotland beat Northern Ireland . Earlier in 1961 Scotland lost 9 – 3 to England at Wembley , and April 1962 Baxter and Crerand played brilliantly , helping Scotland to gain some revenge with a 2 – 0 win . 
 According to many commentators , his greatest performances were against England in 1963 and 1967 . Baxter regarded his performance in 1963 as the better of the two . In the 1963 game Scotland were reduced to 10 men when their left back Eric <unk> 's leg was broken in a tackle – substitutions were not allowed in those days . Baxter , supported by Mackay , White and Law , led Scotland to a 2 – 1 win , scoring both of the goals , the first being Baxter 's first @-@ ever penalty kick , for an English foul on Willie Henderson . Bobby Moore thought this was the best team Scotland ever fielded . 
 The following year Scotland , again inspired by Baxter and Law , beat England 1 – 0 , and only poor finishing prevented them from scoring a bigger win . In 1966 , sixteen months after his leg had been broken , Baxter was no longer able to inspire his team @-@ mates , and Scotland lost 4 – 3 to England . 
 In the 1967 British Home Championship , Baxter produced a dominating but controversial performance for Scotland , tantalising England , who had won the World Cup in 1966 , by playing " <unk> <unk> " ( ball juggling ) while waiting for team @-@ mates to get into good positions . Some commentators accepted that humiliating the opposition was a valid objective , while others regarded it as childish and thought Scotland should have won a more convincing victory than the actual 3 – 2 scoreline . Team @-@ mate Denis Law expressed opinions on both sides of this debate , saying that Baxter was " the best player on the park " and the main reason for the Scots ' victory , but complaining that Baxter 's lack of urgency had prevented Scotland from thoroughly avenging the 9 – 3 defeat in April 1961 . Alex Ferguson said Baxter 's performance " could have been set to music " . In this game Baxter also conspired with Billy Bremner against Alan Ball , sending Bremner a " 50 @-@ 50 " pass , which allowed Bremner to " hit Ball like a train " when Ball contested possession . ( Was it not Nobby Stiles ? ) As Scotland were the first team to beat England after the 1966 FIFA World Cup , the Tartan Army proclaimed themselves " unofficial world champions " . 
 In October 1963 , which may have been Baxter 's best year overall , he played in the " rest of the world " in a match against England to celebrate the centenary of The Football Association . He came on to the field in the second half , and his performance won the admiration of Ferenc Puskás . However England won the match 2 – 1 . 
 Scotland did not qualify for the final stage of the FIFA World Cup during Baxter 's playing career . Scottish public opinion at the time blamed lack of commitment by the " Anglos " , Scottish @-@ born players who spent little or none of their playing careers in Scotland . However at the time beating England was more important to the Scots . In 1960 – 61 , when Baxter played in all the qualifying matches for the 1962 World Cup , they finished first equal in their qualifying group but lost the play @-@ off against Czechoslovakia , who were runners @-@ up to Brazil in the Final . Four years later Baxter played in only two of the qualifying games , ( however one of these games was against Italy where he made John Greig 's winning goal after starting the move by taking the ball from Scotland 's keeper ) before breaking his leg in a club game in Vienna . Scotland finished second in their qualifying group , behind Italy . In 1968 – 69 he was not selected to play in any of the qualifiers for the 1970 World Cup .

 After moving to Rangers , Baxter became a notorious womaniser . In his words , " One day , I was a Raith Rovers player who <unk> pull the birds at the Cowdenbeath Palais . The next day I was in Glasgow and the girls were throwing themselves at me . It was certainly a change and I wasn 't letting it go by . " However , in 1965 he married Jean Ferguson , a hairdresser , and the couple brought up two sons Alan and Steven . His marriage to Jean broke down in 1981 and the two divorced . Jean married golfer William <unk> three years later . In 1983 Baxter formed a relationship with Norma Morton , and the couple remained together until his death in 2001 . 
 Baxter was free of the sectarianism that marked the rivalry between Glasgow 's two leading teams . His close friends included the Celtic players Billy McNeill , Pat Crerand and Mike Jackson , in defiance of the unwritten rule that rivals did not associate . 
 Like some other British football stars of the late 20th century , Baxter drank to excess , and at one point was said to be consuming three bottles of Bacardi a day . Scotland team @-@ mate Dave Mackay unsuccessfully advised him to train harder and live more sensibly . Baxter often got falling @-@ down drunk the night before a match , but this did not seem to hamper his play , and team managers took little notice of his drinking . After retiring from football Baxter became a pub licensee , an unsuitable career for a problem drinker . At the age of 55 he needed two liver transplants in four days , and promised to quit drinking . 
 His other lifelong addiction was gambling , at which he lost £ 500 @,@ 000 by his own estimate and £ 250 @,@ 000 by third @-@ party estimates . Later in his life , when asked if earning the huge incomes of footballers in later decades would have made a difference , he replied , " Aye , I would have gambled £ 50 @,@ 000 a week on the horses instead of £ 100 . " 
 In February 2001 , Baxter was diagnosed as suffering from cancer of the pancreas , and he died at his home on Glasgow 's South Side on 14 April 2001 , with his partner Norma and his sons Alan and Steven at his bedside . His funeral was held in Glasgow Cathedral , where a reading was given by Gordon Brown , a long @-@ time fan of Raith Rovers F.C. , where Baxter began his career . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Baxter was noted for accurate passes , for sending opponents the wrong way with a swivel of his hips , and for inspiring team @-@ mates with his confident approach . Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson described Baxter as " arguably the best player to play in Scottish football " and " the greatest player I ever played with ... He had touch , balance , vision and just this wonderful aura ... " Rangers manager Willie Waddell said , " Jim was the finest left half ever produced by Rangers . " Jimmy Johnstone , who played for Ranger 's great rivals Celtic , said shortly after Baxter 's death , " He was a great man and a genius on the ball . " Allegedly Pelé once said that Baxter should have been a Brazilian . After Baxter 's performance in the 1963 " rest of the world " vs England match , Ferenc Puskás asked , " Where has this fellow been hiding ? " Shortly before he died George Best named Baxter as one of the best eleven players he had played with or against in an interview with FourFourTwo magazine . 
 Baxter is a member of the Rangers supporters ' Hall of Fame , and one of the first 50 added to the Scottish Sporting Hall of Fame when it was created in 2005 . In 2004 , he was also inducted into the Scottish Football Hall of Fame . In the December 1999 issue of World Soccer magazine he was voted by a readers ' poll into a list of the 100 greatest players of the 20th century . He played most of his best football in his early twenties , before the leg fracture against Rapid Vienna in December 1964 and the start of his heavy drinking that made his nickname " Slim Jim " less appropriate . 
 Baxter attracted attention by his stylish play , controlling the game with " unhurried artistry " and refusing to conform with the " efficient " style that dominated English football or the energetic , physical style that was typical of Rangers at the time . He described his approach as " treating the ball like a woman . Give it a cuddle , caress it a wee bit , take your time , and you 'll get the required response " . Although Rangers insisted that players tuck their shirts completely into their shorts , Baxter always let part of his dangle over his left hip . He was also noted as a joker on the pitch . After the replay of the Scottish Cup Final against Celtic in 1963 he stuffed the match ball up his shirt and later gave it to a new member of the team . The SFA insisted that the ball should be returned , and Rangers sent them a ball , but possibly not the match ball . 
 The Tartan Army unsuccessfully attempted to get the new Wembley Stadium footbridge named after him , and on 24 February 2005 Scottish National Party MP Pete Wishart presented an Early Day Motion in the House of Commons supporting this campaign . 
 In 2003 , a statue of Baxter was erected in his birthplace , Hill of Beath in Fife , after a campaign that raised £ 80 @,@ 000 .

 Malcolm Earl " Mal " Waldron ( August 16 , 1925 – December 2 , 2002 ) was an American jazz pianist , composer , and arranger . He started playing professionally in New York in 1950 , after graduating from university . In the following dozen years or so Waldron led his own bands and played for those led by Charles Mingus , Jackie McLean , John Coltrane , and Eric Dolphy , among others . During Waldron 's period as house pianist for Prestige Records in the late 1950s , he appeared on dozens of albums and composed for many of them , including writing his most famous song , " Soul Eyes " , for Coltrane . Waldron was often an accompanist for vocalists , and was Billie Holiday 's regular accompanist from April 1957 until her death in July 1959 . 
 A breakdown caused by a drug overdose in 1963 left Waldron unable to play or remember any music ; he regained his skills gradually , while redeveloping his speed of thought . He left the U.S. permanently in the mid @-@ 1960s , settled in Europe , and continued touring internationally until his death . 
 In his 50 @-@ year career , Waldron recorded more than 100 albums under his own name and more than 70 for other band leaders . He also wrote for modern ballet , and composed the scores of several feature films . As a pianist , Waldron 's roots lay chiefly in the hard bop and post @-@ bop genres of the New York club scene of the 1950s , but with time he gravitated more towards free jazz . He is known for his dissonant chord voicings and distinctive later playing style , which featured repetition of notes and motifs . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Mal Waldron was born in New York City on August 16 , 1925 , to West Indian immigrants . His father was a mechanical engineer who worked on the Long Island Rail Road . The family moved to Jamaica , Long Island when Mal was four years old . Waldron 's parents discouraged his initial interest in jazz , but he was able to maintain it by listening to swing on the radio . Waldron had classical piano lessons from the age of around seven until he was about 16 . He then became inspired to play jazz on tenor saxophone when he heard Coleman Hawkins ' 1939 recording of " Body and Soul " , but bought an alto saxophone , unable to afford a tenor . He played alto for local bands that performed for " dances , bar mitzvahs , Spanish weddings " , frequently taking over the pianist 's role when other musicians took their solos . 
 In 1943 , after school and having enrolled at university , Waldron was called up by the army , and was based at West Point , in New York . This allowed him to listen to the greats of jazz in clubs on 52nd Street and elsewhere in the city . After two years in the army , he returned as a student to Queens College in New York , where he studied under composer Karol Rathaus and made the final decision to switch from saxophone to piano . This decision was influenced in part by hearing Charlie Parker 's virtuoso speed on saxophone , and by not having the extroverted personality Waldron thought necessary for that instrument . Not yet a professional musician , he received money through the G.I. Bill and continued to live with his parents . After obtaining a B.A. in music in 1949 , Waldron worked for a short time in rhythm and blues bands , including with Big Nick Nicholas . 
 = = Later life and career = = 
 = = = Early career in New York = = = 
 Waldron went on to work with Ike Quebec in New York in 1950 and made his recording debut with the saxophonist in 1952 . They played at Café Society Downtown on Mondays for six or seven months , which helped Waldron gain exposure and more work . Waldron worked frequently with Charles Mingus from 1954 to 1956 , as part of the latter 's jazz composers ' workshop . He was pianist on several Mingus recordings , including Pithecanthropus Erectus , which was a key development in the movement towards freer collective improvisation in jazz . In 1955 , Waldron worked with Lucky <unk> and Lucky Thompson . Waldron formed his own band in 1956 , which consisted of <unk> <unk> ( trumpet ) , Gigi Gryce ( alto saxophone ) , Julian Euell ( bass ) , and Arthur Edgehill ( drums ) . This band recorded Waldron 's first release as a leader , Mal @-@ 1 , in November of that year . Waldron was Billie Holiday 's regular accompanist from April 1957 until her death in July 1959 , including for the all @-@ star television broadcast The Sound of Jazz . 
 Waldron played on numerous sessions for Prestige Records from 1956 to 1958 , as he was the house pianist with the label , a position he acquired after being introduced to Prestige by saxophonist Jackie McLean . Waldron appeared on several McLean @-@ led recordings , and was praised by critic John S. Wilson for these performances as being " a consistently interesting and inventive pianist , who apparently can create fresh and provocative ideas even in the midst of a shrilling bedlam " . Other leaders he worked under at Prestige included Gene <unk> , Kenny Burrell , John Coltrane , and Phil Woods . Waldron often used his own arrangements and compositions for the Prestige sessions , of which his most famous , " Soul Eyes " , written for Coltrane , became a widely recorded jazz standard following its initial appearance on the 1957 album Interplay for 2 Trumpets and 2 Tenors . He composed at night at home in St. Albans between all @-@ day recording sessions , and in a car travelling to and from the studio in Hackensack . Waldron estimated that he composed more than 400 pieces of music during his time with Prestige . 
 After Holiday died , Waldron played with vocalist Abbey Lincoln and her husband , drummer Max Roach . Around this time , Waldron 's playing on his own recordings became darker , featuring emotional shifts and variations in minor keys . In 1961 , Waldron played in Eric Dolphy and Booker Little 's quintet , a promising combination that ended when Little died that year , aged 23 . 
 In addition to writing for his own band and those led by others , Waldron wrote and arranged for early play @-@ along records that were published by Music Minus One . Some of these recordings on which Waldron played were released under his name . He also wrote scores for modern ballet in the 1950s and started writing film scores in the following decade . His writing for the film The Cool World ( released in 1964 ) was described in The Oxford Companion to Jazz as one of the first attempts to stress improvisation rather than composition in a jazz @-@ based film score . 
 = = = Breakdown and recovery = = = 
 In 1963 Waldron had a major breakdown caused by a heroin overdose . He recounted in 1998 that a lot of musicians in the 1950s and 1960s felt that taking drugs was necessary for career progression . The police assumed they were all doing it , according to Waldron : 
 The police would stop the musicians and search us as we came out of the clubs after work . We had to turn our pockets inside out . After a while , the musicians thought ... well , if you have the name you might as well have the game . Eventually , I overdosed . I couldn 't remember my own name . My hands were trembling , I couldn 't play the piano . I needed shock treatments and a spinal tap to bring me back . 
 Waldron always felt that he had to return to playing , but this was a slow process . About a year after the overdose , his physical recovery was sufficient to allow him to start <unk> his skills , which he did partly by listening to his own records . His recovery as a musician continued for another two years , as his speed of thought was still too slow over that period to allow genuine improvisation : " I worked out my solos in advance and played what I had written out , until gradually all my faculties returned " . 
 = = = Career after move to Europe = = = 
 From the mid @-@ 1960s on , Waldron spent a lot of time in Europe : Paris , Rome , Bologna , and Cologne , before moving permanently to Munich in 1967 . Waldron originally moved to France when film director Marcel Carné asked him if he wanted to compose the score for Three Rooms in Manhattan in New York or Paris ; Waldron 's 1958 experience touring Europe with Holiday made the decision an easy one . Waldron 's stated reasons for settling in Europe were his disgust with the " fierce , cutthroat competition , just to get a job " and the fact that black musicians were paid less than their white counterparts in the U.S. The 1965 score for Three Rooms in Manhattan was followed by one for the American film Sweet Love , Bitter in 1967 . Waldron also composed for theater ( Amiri Baraka 's The Slave and Dutchman ) , television , and short films . In Europe around this time he played with other expatriates , including Ben Webster and Kenny Clarke . 
 Waldron 's 1969 album Free at Last was the first release on the ECM label . This recording was an example of Waldron playing , in his words , " rhythmically instead of soloing on chord changes " . Two years later , another Waldron recording session was the first for another label that became firmly established – <unk> Records . In the early 1970s , he collaborated with the German avant @-@ rock band Embryo on two albums , Steig Aus ! and <unk> . Waldron also wrote the score for the 1972 French film George Who ? 
 Waldron became popular in Japan , first playing there in 1970 , after being invited by Swing Journal following the success of one of his earlier recordings . From 1975 he made visits to the U.S. , mostly playing solo piano from the late 1970s to early 1980s . Other formats included a quartet with Joe Henderson , Herbie Lewis , and Freddie Waits ; another quartet with Charlie Rouse , Calvin Hill and <unk> Arnold ; a trio with Hill and Arnold ; and a duo with Cameron Brown . Waldron performed and recorded extensively throughout Europe and Japan . In the early 1980s he reported that he allotted agents in France , Germany , Italy and Scandinavia a month each per year of his time , but set aside two months for Japan . 
 During the 1980s and 1990s Waldron worked with Steve Lacy , notably in piano – soprano duets playing their own compositions as well as Thelonious Monk 's . Duet albums with others were also prominent in Waldron 's recordings from the early 1980s . This setting was chosen partly for economic reasons , but mainly for artistic ones , Waldron stated : " jazz is like a conversation . [ ... ] So to do this face to face , it is more direct , stronger and more accurate " . A further film score was written for Japanese director Haruki Kadokawa 's Tokyo Blues in 1986 . 
 Waldron moved from Munich to Brussels in the 1990s , stating that , in Belgium , " nobody stands on the corner waiting for the lights to change . In Germany they watch the lights instead of the cars . The lights never killed anybody . " From the mid @-@ 1990s , Waldron traveled to the U.S. less frequently , put off by no longer being allowed to smoke in many of the jazz clubs there . Around the same period , Waldron recorded several albums with vocalist Jeanne Lee . Two of his final recordings were duets with saxophonists who tended , as he did , to play in melodic and free forms : David Murray and Archie Shepp . After some years of indifferent health , Waldron , a heavy smoker , was diagnosed with cancer in 2002 . He continued to perform until his death on December 2 of that year in a hospital in Brussels , due to complications resulting from the cancer . He was 77 , and had played his final concert in Lille two weeks earlier . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Waldron married twice and had seven children – two with his first wife and five with the second . Billie Holiday was godmother to his first daughter . Waldron 's first wife , Elaine , occasionally sang on his recordings . His second wife was Japanese , and they owned and let several apartments in Japan . Combining birthday celebrations with a tour , Waldron took both families – ex @-@ wife , wife , seven children and two grandchildren – on his three @-@ week tour of Japan that coincided with his seventieth birthday . Waldron 's mother died in 1979 . He could speak English , French , German , and Japanese . 
 = = Playing style = = 
 When he first played with Mingus , Waldron was a follower of Horace Silver 's style , which used added chords and passing notes , as well as Bud Powell 's , which contained many runs . Mingus encouraged him to strip away these things and concentrate on basic and altered harmonies . Before his breakdown , Waldron played in a lyrical way , but after it , " I couldn 't find that lyricism inside myself any more , so I became a very angular player " , becoming more like Thelonious Monk in playing and composition style . 
 From the time he moved to Europe , Waldron played mostly in a free style , while being able to play in a more traditional style when the audience or situation required it . He used thick chords in the lower bass register ; his emphasis on weight , texture and frequent repetition of a single and simple motif as opposed to linear and melodic improvisation gave a heavy and dark color to his sound . One facet of his playing was , according to The Penguin Guide to Jazz , " likened to American minimalism : a slow accretion of almost subliminal harmonic and rhythmic shifts steadily pile up until the music seems ready to <unk> " . 
 As an accompanist to vocalists Holiday , Lincoln , Lee and others , Waldron was described by critic and musician Alyn Shipton as " one of the most sublime accompanists in jazz " . 
 Waldron 's own assessment of his style was that it was partly a reflection of his personality : " It 's part of my personality to be very economical with what I have and to use it in all variations before I move to the next set of notes " . He acknowledged the influences of Holiday ( on his conception of space and playing behind the beat ) , Mingus ( for the importance of individuality ) , and Roach ( on the value of time signatures other than the usual 4 / 4 ) , as well as pianists Duke Ellington , Monk , Powell and Art Tatum . 
 = = Influence = = 
 Waldron has influenced later generations of pianists . Examples are Matthew Shipp and Stanley Cowell . Another , Ethan Iverson , describes Waldron as one of his biggest influences , and reports having imitated most aspects of the older man 's style during his own musical development , through listening to Waldron 's recordings . Waldron contributed more personally to Ran Blake 's progress : he was Blake 's teacher for a time , helping him to improve his rhythmic flexibility and idea development .

 = Hydnellum ferrugineum = 
 Hydnellum ferrugineum , commonly known as the mealy tooth or the reddish @-@ brown corky spine fungus , is a species of tooth fungus in the family Bankeraceae . A widely distributed species , it is found in north Africa , Asia , Europe , and North America . The fungus fruits on the ground singly or in clusters in conifer forest , usually in poor ( low nutrient ) or sandy soil . Fruit bodies are somewhat top @-@ shaped , measuring 3 – 10 cm ( 1 – 4 in ) in diameter . Their velvety surfaces , initially white to pink , sometimes exude drops of red liquid . The lower surface of the fruit body features white to reddish @-@ brown spines up to 6 mm long . Mature fruit bodies become dark reddish brown in color , and are then difficult to distinguish from other similar Hydnellum species . H. ferrugineum forms a mat of mycelia in the humus and upper soil where it grows . The presence of the fungus changes the characteristics of the soil , making it more podzolized . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The species was originally described scientifically by Elias Magnus Fries , who named it Hydnum ferrugineum in 1815 . Its taxonomic history includes transfers to the genera Calodon by Petter Karsten in 1881 , and <unk> by Joseph Schröter in 1888 . It was assigned its current binomial name by Karsten when he transferred it to its current genus , Hydnellum , in 1879 . 
 In 1964 , Canadian mycologist Kenneth A. Harrison described a hydnoid fungus found with Pinus resinosa in Michigan and Pinus banksiana in Nova Scotia . The fungus , which Harrison named Hydnellum pineticola , is considered to be synonymous with Hydnellum ferrugineum by the nomenclatural database Index Fungorum . Harrison noted " The attempts to recognize European species in North American collections has only increased the confusion in this country , and until someone has worked critically in the field on both continents , it is better to make a recognizable grouping of our own population as that to guess that they may be the same as those that grow in Europe . " Other taxa considered synonymous with H. ferrugineum are Pierre Bulliard 's 1791 Hydnum <unk> ( including later synonyms Calodon hybridus ( Bull . ) Lindau , and Hydnellum <unk> ( Bull . ) Banker ) ; Louis Secretan 's Hydnum <unk> ( 1833 ) ; and Howard James Banker 's 1906 Hydnellum <unk> . Banker explained the difficulty in identifying old Hydnellum specimens : " A considerable number of collections have had to be set aside , as in the dried state , with no notes on the fresh characters , it was impossible to decide with any degree of satisfaction whether the plants represented H. <unk> , H. concrescens , H. scrobiculatum , or some undescribed form . " 
 Common names given to the species include the " reddish @-@ brown corky spine fungus " , and the British Mycological Society @-@ sanctioned name " mealy fungus " . The specific epithet ferrugineum is Latin for " rust @-@ colored " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The fruit bodies of Hydnellum ferrugineum are more or less top @-@ shaped with caps that are 3 – 10 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 – 3 @.@ 9 in ) in diameter . They are at first convex , then pulvinate ( cushion @-@ shaped ) , later flattening or becoming slightly depressed in the center . The cap surface of young fruit bodies is uneven , with a velvety to felted texture , and a whitish to pink color . It sometimes exudes blood @-@ red drops of fluid in the depressions . The surface later becomes flesh @-@ colored to dark reddish brown , but with wavy margin remaining whitish . The lower surface of the fruit body bears the hymenium , the fertile spore @-@ bearing tissue . It comprises a dense arrangement of white to reddish brown spines up to 6 mm long , hanging vertically downwards . The stout stipe measures 1 – 6 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 – 2 @.@ 4 in ) long by 1 – 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 – 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick , and is the same color as the cap . Fruit bodies have a " distinctly mealy " odor ( similar to the smell of freshly ground flour ) , but are inedible . 
 The flesh is reddish or purplish @-@ brown with white flecks . Initially spongy and soft , it becomes tough and corky as the fruit body matures . In the stipe , the flesh can become blackish in age . Like other Hydnellum species , fruit body tissue is made of generative hyphae that do not expand . This slows the growth of the fruit body , often enabling it to persist for several months . The fungus employs an indeterminate growth pattern , in which the fruit body formation begins from a vertical column of hyphae that eventually expand at the top to form the cap . Any solid objects encountered during growth , such as grass or twigs , can be enveloped by the expanding fruit body . Similarly , closely neighboring caps can fuse together during growth . 
 The broadly ellipsoid to roughly spherical spores are 5 @.@ 5 – 7 @.@ 5 by 4 @.@ 5 – 5 @.@ 5 μm . Their surfaces are covered with small rounded bumps . The basidia ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are narrowly club @-@ shaped , four @-@ spored , and measure 25 – 30 by 6 – 7 @.@ 5 μm . The hyphae of the flesh are brownish with thin walls , and measure 4 – 6 μm ; hyphae in the spines are thin @-@ walled , septate , and sometimes branched , measuring 3 @.@ 5 – 4 @.@ 5 μm . The hyphae do not have clamp connections . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Hydnellum peckii is similar in appearance , but has an acrid taste , and clamp connections in its hyphae . Hydnellum spongiosipes is readily confused with H. ferrugineum , and several authors have historically considered the two species to be the same ; molecular studies , however , indicate that the two fungi are closely related , but distinct . In contrast with H. ferrugineum , H. spongiosipes has a darker cap when young , darker flesh , and occurs in deciduous woods . Old fruit bodies of H. ferrugineum can be confused with those of Hydnellum concrescens . 
 = = Habitat and distribution = = 
 Hydnellum ferrugineum is found mainly in coniferous woodland , often near pines , but occasionally with spruce . Fruit bodies have a preference for sandy soil with low levels of organic matter and nutrients , and grow singly or in clusters . They are more likely to be found in older @-@ growth forests . The fungus occurs in North America , including Mexico . It is widespread but generally uncommon throughout Europe , although there may be local areas where it is common . In Britain , H. ferrugineum is provisionally classified as endangered , and is protected under the Wildlife and Countryside Act 1981 ; it was included as one of 14 species considered in the United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan for stipitate hydnoid fungi ( i.e. , hydnoid fungi with a cap and stipe ) in 2004 . The fungus is protected in Montenegro . It has been collected in India and North Africa . 
 The fungus forms a tough mat of mycelia in the humus and upper soil of pine forests . This mycelial mat grows larger with old trees , and can cover an area of several square meters . These areas generally lack dwarf shrubs and promote the vigorous growth of mosses ; reindeer lichens often occur in the center of large mats . The presence of the fungus changes the nature of the soil , resulting in a thinner humus layer , decreased groundwater penetration , decreased soil pH , and increases in the level of root respiration as well as the quantity of roots . The fungus also decreases the organic carbon and nitrogen concentrations . Soil with the mycelium becomes more podzolized than the surrounding soil . Similar to some other Hydnellum species , H. ferrugineum is sensitive to the increased nitrogen deposition resulting from clear @-@ cutting , a forestry practice used in some areas of Europe . The fungus forms an unusual type of mycorrhiza with Scots pine ( Pinus sylvestris ) in which the ectomycorrhiza appears normal at the leading edge of the mycelial mat , but leaves behind dead and atrophied roots at the trailing edge , showing saprophytic tendencies . 
 = = Bioactive compounds = = 
 Hydnellum ferrugineum fruit bodies contain the pigments <unk> ( dark violet ) and <unk> ( yellow ) , as well as small amounts of the polyphenol compound atromentin . <unk> has a chemical structure that closely resembles that of thelephoric acid , a pigment found in other species of Hydnellum and Hydnum , and they may originate from a common precursor compound .

 = October 1996 India cyclone = 
 The October 1996 India cyclone ( also known as Cyclone 05A ) had an unusual and protracted path that spanned much of the northern Indian Ocean . It originated in a weather disturbance that formed on October 14 in the southern Bay of Bengal , off India 's east coast . Moving westward , it struck Andhra Pradesh on October 17 as a well @-@ defined low pressure area . It crossed southern India and reorganized in the Arabian Sea off the western coast of India . The system developed into a depression on October 22 and quickly intensified while moving northward . By October 24 , the cyclone approached hurricane intensity as it developed an eye , reaching peak winds of at least 110 km / h ( 70 mph ) . On October 25 , the storm abruptly stalled and weakened off Gujarat , and progressed southwestward as a minimal storm . It was no longer classifiable as a tropical cyclone by October 28 , although its remnants persisted until November 2 when they dissipated east of Somalia . 
 In southern India , the storm dropped heavy rainfall that caused severe flooding in Andhra Pradesh . At least 112 reservoirs and dams were breached , killing 200 people in Prakasam district . The floodwaters ruined about 1 @,@ 600 @,@ 000 ha ( 4 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 acres ) of crops and damaged around 53 @,@ 000 houses , leaving thousands homeless . The floods killed 388 people in southern India and caused US $ 388 million in damage . The storm later brushed the west coast of India , stranding 50 boats . The Indian military helped with relief and rescue efforts . Another cyclone struck Andhra Pradesh in November , causing additional damage and deaths . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The long @-@ tracked storm originated from the monsoon trough , which spawned an area of convection , or thunderstorms , in the southern Bay of Bengal on October 14 . It moved to the west @-@ northwest and later to the west without much development . The India Meteorological Department ( IMD ) classified the system as a well @-@ marked low pressure area before the system moved over the southern Indian state of Andhra Pradesh on October 17 . The system slowly crossed southern India , emerging into the Arabian Sea on October 21 . That day , the convection organized into a circular cluster as the circulation became more defined . The system slowed and turned to the north around the periphery of a ridge to the east . The system organized into a depression on October 22 , the same day that the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) classified it as Tropical Cyclone 05A . 
 As the storm moved slowly northward , it quickly intensified , and the IMD upgraded the system 's status from a depression on October 22 to severe cyclonic storm status late on October 23 . Around that time , the storm developed an eye , and the JTWC estimated 1 minute peak winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) at 18 : 00 UTC that day , equivalent to a minimal hurricane . On October 24 , the IMD estimated peak 3 minute winds of 110 km / h ( 70 mph ) , although estimates derived from the Dvorak technique suggested winds of 120 km / h ( 75 mph ) . 
 On October 25 , the storm stalled about 95 km ( 60 mi ) south of the Gujarat coast , as steering currents from the retreating ridge of high pressure diminished . Strengthening wind shear , cooler waters , and dry air rapidly weakened the storm . By late on October 25 , the JTWC had discontinued warnings , and the IMD downgraded the storm to depression status . The system began moving to the southwest away from the wind shear . The IMD downgraded the system further to a remnant low on October 28 , although the JTWC began issuing advisories again after a nearby ship reported winds of 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) . Accelerating to the west , the storm again weakened on October 31 , prompting the JTWC to discontinue advisories while the system was about 110 km ( 70 mi ) northeast of Socotra . The remnants turned to the southwest , dissipating near the east coast of Somalia on November 2 . 
 The JTWC remarked that the storm " had one of the most unusual tracks in North Indian Ocean cyclone history " and was also one of the longest tracked cyclones in the basin . According to the IMD , most storms approaching Gujarat strike the coast or weaken and move westward . The agency stated that " there is no parallel of this system in [ tropical cyclone history ] . " 
 = = Impact and aftermath = = 
 The precursor to the storm brought heavy rainfall to southern India , mainly in Andhra Pradesh , as well as in Tamil Nadu to the south , Karnataka to the west , and Kerala to the southwest . Daily totals reached 230 mm ( 9 @.@ 1 in ) in portions of Andhra Pradesh , where damage was heaviest . The rains flooded rivers and cities , with thousands of residents in Hyderabad stranded in their houses . About 40 villages were isolated in Kadapa district . Throughout the region , the storm damaged 53 @,@ 000 houses . About 86 @,@ 000 people sought shelter after the storm , and thousands were left homeless . Highways and railroads were inundated , with many bridges washed away . At least 112 reservoirs and dams were breached . The floods also damaged about 1 @,@ 600 @,@ 000 ha ( 3 @,@ 953 @,@ 000 acre ) of crop fields – 450 @,@ 000 ha ( 1 @,@ 111 @,@ 000 acre ) of rice and 1 @,@ 150 @,@ 000 ha ( 2 @,@ 842 @,@ 000 acre ) of ground nuts – and killed about 45 @,@ 000 head of cattle . At least 200 people were killed in the Prakasam district after reservoirs were damaged . In Tamil Nadu , south of Andhra Pradesh , at least 10 people were killed , all in Chennai . Overall , 388 people died in southern India due to the floods , including at least 326 in Andhra Pradesh . Damage was estimated at US $ 128 @.@ 5 million , of which US $ 120 million was in Andhra Pradesh . 
 After the floods , helicopters airlifted relief supplies like food and water to isolated villages , and to residents riding out the floods on their roofs . However , relief coordination was disrupted by damaged communication lines and ongoing rainfall . Rescue boats were used to rescue stranded residents . India 's Prime Minister H. D. Deve Gowda provided 500 million rupees ( US $ 15 million ) to help Andhra Pradesh with flood recovery . Conditions returned to normal within 12 days of the onslaught of the rains , with the exception of minor delays to trains . However , another cyclone struck Andhra Pradesh about three weeks after the flood event , killing over 1 @,@ 000 people . 
 Upon forming and moving parallel to India 's west coastline , the storm dropped rainfall in the Konkan region of Maharashtra and neighboring Goa . The threat of the storm prompted schools to be closed around Mumbai . Later , it brushed Gujarat with heavy rainfall and gusty winds . About 50 boats were stranded amid high seas , and 11 other boats were left missing from the Veraval port . During the height of the storm , 320 fishermen were unaccounted for , spurring the Indian navy to launch search and rescue missions . 
 = Convoy Faith = 
 Convoy Faith was a small , fast Allied convoy of World War II . It suffered heavy casualties when attacked by German Focke @-@ Wulf Fw 200 Condor long @-@ range bombers while en route from Britain to West Africa in July 1943 . The convoy comprised two large troopships and a freighter , later joined by two destroyers and two frigates as escorts at various dates after it sailed on 7 July 1943 . The two troopships , SS California and SS Duchess of York , both former liners , were carrying military personnel to West Africa , where locally recruited troops were to be embarked as reinforcements for the Allied forces in Burma and the Middle East . The freighter MV Port Fairy , carrying ammunition , was ultimately bound for Australia and New Zealand via the Panama canal . 
 On the evening of 11 July , four days after sailing , Convoy Faith was attacked by three Condors . Both troopships were severely damaged and subsequently sunk by torpedoes from the escorts ; over 100 of the personnel aboard the two ships were killed . The freighter escaped unscathed , but was damaged in a second air attack on 12 July en route to Casablanca . The loss of the two troopships delayed the movement of a division of West African soldiers to India until four replacements arrived . 
 The British military was surprised by the attack on Convoy Faith , as it had been believed that the Condors no longer posed a serious threat . In response , the convoy route between Britain and Africa was moved to the west . The German Condor force attempted to repeat its success against Convoy Faith by carrying out similar attacks on other convoys , but sustained heavy losses from Allied anti @-@ aircraft guns and aircraft . 
 = = Background = = 
 From August 1940 to June 1941 , the German Luftwaffe ( air force ) unit III . / KG 40 , which was based at Bordeaux – Mérignac Airport in southern France and equipped with Focke @-@ Wulf Fw 200 Condors , attacked Allied shipping travelling in the Atlantic . The unit made a number of successful attacks on convoys and individual ships traveling in the Western Approaches as well as on the route between Britain and Gibraltar . In response , the Allies increased the anti @-@ aircraft armament carried by many merchant ships , and began to deploy CAM ships and escort carriers to provide fighter protection for convoys . During the last six months of 1941 these improved defences inflicted heavy losses on the Condor force , and it ceased attacking shipping in early 1942 . In 1942 , III . / KG 40 mainly operated in the reconnaissance role and reported targets for U @-@ boats to attack . A small number of attacks were made on ships travelling between Britain and Gibraltar from May onwards , but these cost the unit eight Condors destroyed in action and seven in accidents for no sinkings . As a result of the Condor 's vulnerability to Allied defences , the commander of the Luftwaffe 's Atlantic anti @-@ shipping force ( Fliegerführer Atlantik ) recommended in December that the aircraft be withdrawn from service . 
 The British military conducted regular convoys to transfer personnel from the United Kingdom to the Middle East and India from mid @-@ 1940 until late 1943 . This convoy route was assigned the code " WS " , which was widely believed to be an abbreviation for " Winston Special " in honor of Prime Minister Winston Churchill . The WS convoys typically comprised several large ocean liners which had been converted to troopships protected by a strong force of warships . As the Mediterranean Sea was a war zone , the convoys normally traveled from the Clyde in Scotland to the Middle East or South Asia via the Cape of Good Hope at the southern tip of Africa . En route , the ships typically stopped at Freetown in West Africa to refuel and embark water , and again at either Cape Town or Durban in South Africa . German aircraft , submarines and surface ships attacked the WS convoys on occasion . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 Despite its poor performance during most of 1942 , III . / KG 40 's ability to attack Allied shipping was improved late in the year . During the last months of 1942 the unit received 18 C @-@ 4 variants of the Fw 200 which were fitted with the Lotfe 7D bombsight . This sight reduced the Condors ' vulnerability to anti @-@ aircraft fire by allowing them to bomb targets from medium altitudes ; previously they had only been able to attack accurately from low levels . Several of the unit 's Condors were also fitted with surface search radar , which improved their ability to locate Allied ships . In early 1943 it was decided to use these aircraft to renew attacks on convoys travelling to Gibraltar in an attempt to disrupt the Allied buildup in the Mediterranean during the Tunisia Campaign . These attacks began in early March and were conducted off Portugal between Lisbon and Cape St Vincent ; this area was beyond the range of Allied fighter aircraft based in Gibraltar , and few escort carriers were available to protect convoys . III . / KG 40 sank five merchant ships and damaged another two between March and the start of July , for the loss of at least five Condors . In response , the British began to use de Havilland Mosquito fighters to patrol the Bay of Biscay , deployed four additional squadrons of patrol aircraft to Gibraltar , and embarked signals intelligence teams on board warships in the Bay of Biscay to monitor KG 40 's radio communications . 
 In February 1943 the British Government decided to transfer the recently raised 81st ( West Africa ) Division from West Africa to India to take part in the Burma Campaign . This unit required much more shipping space than other British divisions , as its fighting units were supported by thousands of porters . To facilitate the division 's movement , additional troopships were assigned to the regular WS convoys . The 81st Division 's advance parties departed Freetown with Convoys WS 29 and WS 30 in April and May , and the 6th ( West Africa ) Brigade embarked on ships of Convoy WS 31 at Lagos between 2 and 10 July . It was planned to transport the division 's two remaining brigades in convoys WS 32 and WS 33 . 
 The 5th ( West Africa ) Brigade was the second of the 81st Division 's brigades to be shipped from West Africa . The brigade comprised 12 @,@ 000 personnel and was scheduled to depart with Convoy WS 32 on 31 July . The liners Britannic , Largs Bay and Tamaroa were available in Freetown to carry 8 @,@ 528 of these men , and it was decided to sail the troopship SS California directly from the Clyde to provide the remaining berths . 
 California was a liner that had spent the first years of the war as an armed merchant cruiser before being converted to a troopship . She had previously carried troops to Bombay in India as part of convoys WS 22 and 26 . She returned to the Clyde from Gibraltar on 4 June as part of Convoy MFK 15 and spent the next month docked in Glasgow undergoing repairs . Once this work was complete , California began to embark 470 personnel bound for West Africa on 4 July . She was to be accompanied on this voyage by SS Duchess of York , which had been tasked with carrying 600 Royal Air Force personnel and civilians to West Africa , but had missed an earlier convoy owing to electrical problems . Like California , Duchess of York was a pre @-@ war liner which had been converted to a troopship . Prior to the ships ' departure it was decided to use Duchess of York to transport elements of the 5th ( West Africa ) Brigade to Bombay after the ships arrived at Freetown , while California would instead carry other West African personnel to the Middle East . 
 = = Attack = = 
 California and Duchess of York sailed from Greenock on the afternoon of 7 July . They spent the night at anchor in the Clyde ; shortly after getting underway early the next day they were joined by the storeship MV Port Fairy , bound for Australia and New Zealand via West Africa and the Panama Canal . The master of the Duchess of York , Captain W.G. Busk @-@ Wood , probably served as the Convoy Commodore . Busk @-@ Wood had been the master of the liner SS Duchess of Bedford prior to the war , and remained in command of this ship until November 1942 when he transferred to the Duchess of York . He also held the rank of commander in the Royal Naval Reserve . The merchant ships were escorted by the destroyer HMS Douglas and frigate HMS <unk> from 9 July , and the Canadian destroyer HMCS Iroquois joined the convoy the next day . While Iroquois ' commanding officer , Commander <unk> Holms , was the most senior officer present , he chose to not assume command of the convoy as his destroyer would not remain with the troopships for their entire journey . The route taken by Convoy Faith was similar to that of other recent convoys sailing between Britain and Africa . While the strength of the escort force was much smaller than that assigned to the regular convoys , it was believed that submarines posed the main threat and that three warships would provide adequate protection . 
 Convoy Faith was detected by a German Condor at 8 : 00 pm on 11 July while about 480 kilometres ( 300 mi ) off the Portuguese coast . This aircraft circled near the ships , broadcasting a homing signal . Two other Condors joined the first aircraft at about 9 : 00 pm , and they commenced their attack on the convoy shortly thereafter . At this time , Convoy Faith was deployed in a formation intended to protect the ships from submarines . The two troopships and Port Fairy were sailing line abreast ( Duchess of York was the westernmost of the three ships , California was in the centre and Port Fairy at the east of this group ) , Iroquois was located 3 @,@ 000 yards ( 2 @,@ 700 m ) ahead and the two other escorts were on each flank of the troopships . Busk @-@ Wood had maintained this formation after the first Condor was spotted in the belief that the aircraft would call in submarines rather than conduct an attack . 
 The three Condors made their attack from an altitude of about 15 @,@ 000 feet ( 4 @,@ 600 m ) . Despite heavy anti @-@ aircraft fire from the escorts , California was badly damaged by a near miss from the first plane to attack , and was hit by two bombs dropped by the second attacker . The damage caused by these bombs flooded one of the ship 's holds and set her on fire . California 's passengers were evacuated on board lifeboats while the crew tried to save the ship . This proved unsuccessful , however , and they abandoned ship later that night . Duchess of York also came under attack ; several bombs hit the centre of the ship and set her on fire . This fire could not be brought under control , and she too was abandoned , at 10 : 40 pm on 11 July . Port Fairy was also straddled by two near misses , but did not suffer significant damage . Both troopships were subsequently torpedoed and sunk by their escorts , the Duchess of York by Douglas , for fear their blazing hulks would attract German submarines to the area . 
 While there are differing accounts of the casualties on board the two troopships , the official figures state that 89 people were killed on board Duchess of York and 26 on board California . The survivors were rescued by the two destroyers and <unk> , including 660 by Iroquois alone . They were subsequently taken to Casablanca in North Africa by the warships , from where the seamen returned to Britain and military personnel continued to West Africa on board the troopship SS Nea Hellas . 
 The frigate HMS Swale , despatched from Gibraltar to make a scheduled rendezvous , sighted the convoy under attack at 10 : 10 pm , and was herself attacked by Condors , the bombs falling 20 yards astern . After conducting an A / S sweep around the convoy , Swale was ordered to detach and escort Port Fairy to Casablanca . At 6 : 45 pm the following day , Swale rescued eight survivors from a PBY Catalina , but within an hour the two ships were again attacked by Condors returning from a reconnaissance mission . Despite the intervention of two United States Navy Catalinas sent to their aid , a bomb hit Port Fairy on her starboard quarter , starting a fire next to the magazine and disabling her steering . The Catalinas eventually drove off the Condors with machine gun fire ; one of the German aircrew was seriously wounded in this engagement . At 10 : 05 pm Swale came alongside Port Fairy to aid the extinction of the fire with her hoses . With Port Fairy in danger of exploding , 64 survivors from the two troopships and 8 passengers were transferred to Swale . The blaze was eventually extinguished at 00 : 41 am , and both ships continued the remaining 500 nm to Casablanca without further incident , Port Fairy steering by her engines . Port Fairy did not suffer any casualties in the attack and was repaired on arrival at Casablanca . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The losses suffered by Convoy Faith shocked the British military , as it had been believed that the Condor force no longer posed a significant threat . The decision to use a route which was similar to that used by previous convoys despite Convoy Faith 's small escort made it an attractive target . In his assessment of the action Admiral Charles Forbes , the Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , Plymouth strongly criticised the troopships for not taking evasive action during the attack . He also criticised the captain of Iroquois for not assuming command of the convoy . However , the Canadian official history argues that " it is doubtful whether Holms would have acted differently under the circumstances " . In order to prevent a repetition of the attack , the convoy routes between Britain and West Africa were moved further to the west so that they were almost at the limit of the Condors ' range . 
 The loss of California and Duchess of York represented a heavy blow to the Allies ' already heavily committed fleet of large troopships . Duchess of York 's intended role was filled by Nea Hellas after she disembarked Convoy Faith 's survivors at Freetown . Nea Hellas embarked the Gold Coast elements of the 5th ( West Africa ) Brigade at Takoradi from 2 August while Britannic , Tamaroa and Largs Bay loaded the remainder of the unit at other West African ports . Convoy WS 32 sailed from Freetown on 5 August , and Nea Hellas joined it at sea two days later . The liner was left behind at Durban owing to a mechanical fault , but eventually disembarked its soldiers at Bombay in late September after sailing there as part of Convoy CM 45 . The West African personnel which were to be transported to the Middle East on board California were embarked on Convoy WS 33 in September and arrived at their destination in early November . 
 The Germans attempted to build on their success against Convoy Faith by carrying out further medium @-@ altitude attacks on convoys .

 = Abdallah al @-@ Battal = 
 Abdallah al @-@ Battal ( Arabic : عبدالله <unk> ; " Abdallah the Hero " , died in 740 ) was a Muslim warrior of the Arab – Byzantine Wars of the early 8th century , participating in several of the campaigns launched by the Umayyad Caliphate against the Byzantine Empire . Historical facts about his life are scarce , but an extensive pseudo @-@ historical and legendary tradition grew around him after his death , and he became a famous figure in both Arab and later Turkish epic literature as Sayyid Battal Ghazi . 
 = = Biography = = 
 Nothing is known of Abdallah al @-@ Battal 's origin or early life . Much later accounts claim that he hailed from Antioch or Damascus , and that he was a mawla of the Umayyad family . He is also given various kunya , Abu Muhammad , Abu Yahya , or Abu ' l @-@ Husayn , by which he is usually known . His <unk> of al @-@ <unk> ( " of Antioch " ) rather than a tribal affiliation suggests that he was not of Arab origin ; in this context , his name " Abdallah " further suggests that he was a convert to Islam , as this name ( meaning " servant of Allah " ) was often given to new converts in early Islamic times . Khalid Yahya Blankinship suggested that he might be the same person as a certain " ' Amr " recorded by the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor in the Nicaea campaign of 727 , and hence that " ' Amr " could be his actual personal name or a patronymic ( i.e. his name could be ' Amr ibn Abdallah or Abdallah ibn ' Amr ) , while alternatively " Abdallah " could simply be an honorific . 
 According to historical sources ( the chroniclers al @-@ Ya <unk> and al @-@ Tabari ) , al @-@ Battal first appears in 727 , in one of the annual raids against Byzantine Asia Minor . This campaign was commanded by Mu 'awiya ibn Hisham , the son of the reigning Caliph Hisham ( reigned 723 – 743 ) . Al @-@ Battal led the vanguard , with which he penetrated as far as the city of Gangra in Paphlagonia , which he captured and razed , before the army went on to unsuccessfully lay siege to Nicaea . Blankinship considers that al @-@ Battal 's capture of Gangra ranks as one of the greatest successes of Umayyad arms against the Byzantines in this period , along with the capture of Caesarea by Maslama ibn Abd al @-@ Malik in 726 . Later accounts from the 10th century , place al @-@ Battal alongside Maslama during the latter 's failed siege of Constantinople in 717 – 718 , but as the Arab accounts of the siege are semi @-@ legendary , it is impossible to know if this report contains any truth . 
 Al @-@ Battal himself commanded another raid in 731 – 732 , of which little is known . It most probably was a failure , and is remembered only for the death in battle of another Arab hero , Abd al @-@ Wahhab ibn <unk> . In the next year , AH 115 ( 732 – 733 ) , al @-@ Battal campaigned again alongside Mu 'awiya ibn Hisham , raiding as far as Akroinon in Phrygia . A Byzantine army under a certain Constantine tried to confront the Muslims , but al @-@ Battal defeated Constantine and took him prisoner . Al @-@ Battal 's next and last appearance is in 740 , when a major campaign involving several tens of thousands of men was launched by the Umayyads against Byzantium . Along with Malik ibn Shu 'ayb , deputy governor of Malatya , al @-@ Battal commanded a 20 @,@ 000 @-@ strong cavalry force while Sulayman ibn Hisham led the main force behind them . Al @-@ Battal and Malik 's force reached as far as Akroinon , but there they were confronted and defeated by the Byzantines under Emperor Leo III the Isaurian ( r . 717 – 741 ) in person . Both Arab generals and two thirds of their army perished . 
 = = Legend = = 
 If his military career was not particularly distinguished , Abdallah al @-@ Battal quickly became the subject of popular tales and his fame grew , so that by the 10th century he was well established as one of the heroic figures of the Arab – Byzantine Wars : al @-@ Mas 'udi ( The Meadows of Gold , VIII , 74 – 75 ) ranks him among the " illustrious Muslims " whose portraits were displayed in Byzantine churches as a mark of respect . In the 10th – 12th centuries his alleged role in the siege of Constantinople was embellished by the Persian historian Bal 'ami and the Andalusian mystic Ibn Arabi . A number of fictional anecdotes became part of the accepted historical corpus around al @-@ Battal from the time of Ibn ' Asakir ( 1106 – 1175 ) on : the use of his name to frighten children by the Byzantines ; his entry into Amorion pretending to be a messenger and discovery of the Byzantine plans ; his stay at a convent , whose abbess shielded him from Byzantine soldiers and whom he took with him and married ; and finally his death in battle and burial , attended by Emperor Leo himself . On the other hand , beginning with Ibn ' Asakir 's contemporary al @-@ Samaw 'al ibn Yahya al @-@ Maghribi , a succession of Muslim chroniclers were critical of the various fabrications introduced into the accounts of al @-@ Battal 's life . Ibn Kathir in particular regarded it as " poor and confused material suitable only for the unsophisticated " . 
 Al @-@ Battal 's exploits became the subject of two romances , the Arabic @-@ language " Tale of Delhemma and al @-@ Battal " ( Sīrat <unk> al @-@ Himma wa @-@ l @-@ Baṭṭāl ) and the Turkish epic tradition of Sayyid Baṭṭāl <unk> . Although both were composed in the 12th century and draw upon a common Arabic tradition , they show significant differences , with the Turkish tale including many uniquely Turkic and Persian influences , including supernatural elements from folk tradition or motifs from the <unk> and the Romance of Abu Muslim . Both romances place al @-@ Battal in the mid @-@ 9th century and associate him with the epic cycle of Malatya and its emir , Umar al @-@ Aqta ( died 863 ) , with the result that he became particularly associated with the city of Malatya and its region . In the Delhemma , his own role in the Umayyad wars with Byzantium is taken over by the <unk> hero al @-@ <unk> . In these tales al @-@ Battal is presented as an Islamic analogue to Ulysses , to the extent that his name became a byword for cunning . The Turks adopted al @-@ Battal following the <unk> conquest of Malatya in 1102 , and he became prominent as a Turkish national hero and symbol of their conquest of Asia Minor . His stories ( <unk> ) were reworked throughout the Seljuk and Ottoman periods , and he became the subject of a considerable body of folk tales . A cult developed around him as a saintly figure ( " sayyid " ) , especially among the Alevi and Bektashi sects , and his supposed tomb at <unk> became a major centre of pilgrimage until the early 20th century , drawing pilgrims from as far as Central Asia . 
 = Don Kindt = 
 Donald John " Don " Kindt , Sr. ( July 2 , 1925 – May 5 , 2000 ) was an American defensive back and halfback who played nine seasons from 1947 to 1955 for the Chicago Bears in the National Football League . Kindt played college football for the University of Wisconsin Badgers primarily as an halfback from 1943 – 1946 , missing the 1944 and half of the 1945 season because of World War II . He was the starting halfback for the Badgers for most of his college career . 
 Kindt decided to forgo his senior season at Wisconsin in order to be eligible for the 1947 NFL Draft . He was selected with the last pick of the first round ( eleventh overall ) by the Bears despite having an history with injuries , and recovering from an off @-@ season knee surgery he suffered while playing a basketball game at Wisconsin . After playing dual positions in his first few seasons with the Bears , Kindt was used primarily on defense for his last six seasons in the league . Considered to be a defensive standout during his playing career , Kindt was selected to participate in one Pro Bowl , and led the team in interceptions several times . 
 His son Don Kindt , Jr. also played in the National Football League , as a tight end for the Bears during the 1987 season . 
 = = Early career = = 
 Kindt was born in Milwaukee , Wisconsin . He played football for Washington High School in Milwaukee where he named to the All @-@ City squad . He also played guard for Washington 's high school basketball team . 
 = = = 1943 season = = = 
 After graduating from high school , Kindt received a scholarship to the University of Wisconsin . He became the starter at right halfback in his first year , while fellow freshman Clarence Self started at left halfback . In the season opener against Camp Grant , Kindt scored his first career touchdown on a six @-@ yard run in the fourth quarter , which tied the game 7 – 7 . Wisconsin went on to lose the game 10 – 7 after Camp Grant scored a field goal with five seconds left . In his third game , Kindt became a " hero of the game " for his playing tactics against the Iowa Hawkeyes . He scored the only touchdown of the game , a two @-@ yard run , and managed to force the Hawkeyes to score a safety with time expiring when he did a quarterback kneel , and purposely fell down in the end zone , getting an Iowa defender to touch him for the safety . It prevented the Hawkeyes from potentially scoring a game @-@ winning score as the Badgers won the game 7 – 5 . Wisconsin temporarily managed to be in first place in the Big Ten conference play standings , though it was the lone highlight of the season for the Badgers , as they lost all their remaining games , mostly by blowouts and finished with a 1 – 9 record . After his first three games Kindt was impressing Wisconsin 's coaches with his " ball carrying and defensive abilities " , while scoring two of Wisconsin 's three touchdowns so far for the season . In the next game against the University of Illinois , head coach Harry <unk> named Kindt as the captain of the team . He missed the next two games due to a leg infection suffered prior to a game against the University of Notre Dame . He returned for the homecoming game against Northwestern University , where he played a " couple of minutes " as he was still recovering from his injury . He came back to full form against the University of Michigan . Overall , Kindt scored four of Wisconsin 's six touchdowns of the season . 
 = = = World War II and 1945 season = = = 
 Kindt was drafted into the United States Army in 1943 while at Wisconsin , in the mist of World War II . He reported to active duty on February 1 , 1944 , receiving basic training at Fort Wolters , Texas . After training , Kindt was assigned to the Army 's 10th Mountain Division . He missed the 1944 season and half of the 1945 season while participating in the Italian Campaign . He was rewarded with two Bronze Stars , and a Victory Medal for his actions in Italy . Kindt returned to play for the Badgers in October 1945 . In his return , Kindt shared the halfback position with Ben <unk> , and Jerry Thompson . Kindt only managed to play three games that season , mainly because of a late release he received while returning from the Army . When Kindt returned to the squad , one journalist took it as far as hailing Kindt 's return as a " godsend " who inspired the Badgers with his " inspirational play " . He scored two touchdowns against Iowa upon his return . In the season finale on November 24 against the Minnesota Golden Gophers , Kindt scored three touchdowns despite being used as a " blocking back " in a 26 – 12 win . The Badgers finished the season with a 3 – 4 – 2 record . 
 = = = 1946 season = = = 
 Prior to the 1946 season , Kindt was involved in a skiing accident when he fell down a flight of stairs , hurting his leg . He regained his job as the primary starter at the halfback position in time for the season opener . Kindt battled injuries with his ankle , leg and thigh throughout the season , which hampered his play at times . He rushed for 42 yards on 14 carries and one touchdown in a 20 – 7 upset over 14th ranked Ohio State Buckeyes on October 13 , the first time Wisconsin beat Ohio State in football since 1942 . The next game , a 27 – 21 loss against the University of Illinois , Kindt suffered a left knee injury after getting " kicked in the shins " during the fourth quarter and left the game , not playing on a regular basis afterwards . He rushed only for 21 yards on five carries in a 21 – 7 loss against Iowa on November 9 . After the season , Kindt injured his right knee while playing a game of intramural basketball , requiring surgery at a time in which knee surgery wasn 't as technologically advanced as today . 
 During his career in Wisconsin , Kindt was considered to be the team 's best all @-@ around player , a person who could run , throw , and kick efficiently , as well as playing defense . He also punted and played safety for Wisconsin . Kindt was named to the Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1988 and the University of Wisconsin Athletic Hall of Fame in 1997 . 
 = = NFL career = = 
 Kindt forfeited his last year of eligibility at Wisconsin after the 1946 season to play in the National Football League . It was reported that the Chicago Bears had Kindt as its top player in their draft wish list . By the time the 1947 NFL Draft was held , the Bears managed to get Kindt with the eleventh overall pick . He soon signed a three @-@ year contract at a reported $ 25 @,@ 000 to play for head coach George Halas . After starting in a dual offensive / defensive role , Kindt decided to focus on playing only as a defensive back for the last few seasons of his career . 
 During his rookie season , Kindt joined a backfield which contained quarterback Sid Luckman and George McAfee , the primary starter at halfback . That season Kindt rushed for 266 yards and two touchdowns on 61 carries . One of his touchdowns was a meaningless three @-@ yard run while the game was out of reach , a 49 – 7 blowout against the Chicago Cardinals on November 23 . The next season Kindt rushed for 189 yards on 54 carries and two touchdowns , as the Bears acquired former Heisman Trophy winner Johnny Lujack and Bobby Layne to join Kindt , Luckman and McAfee in the backfield . A highlight of the season happened against the Detroit Lions on October 17 when he had a 66 @-@ yard run for a touchdown in a 28 – 0 Bears victory . After running for 118 yards on 41 carries , an average of 2 @.@ 9 yards per carry during the 1949 season , Kindt contributions to the offense were limited despite Layne getting traded to the New York Yanks , Lujack being injured and both McAfee and Luckman retiring . In his final six seasons , he only carried the ball 16 times for 13 yards and no touchdowns . 
 Kindt was a starter at defensive back for most of his career . An outspoken player , Kindt was the defensive captain of the team by 1952 . He was not afraid to criticize head coach George Halas on some of his coaching decisions , at times having to get separated from each other . One notable incident was during a 1952 loss against the Dallas Texans which Halas decided to start his second sting unit because the Texans were winless prior to the game . Kindt and Halas had to be separated after the final play of the game because Kindt " laughed " at something to his teammates after the Texans won and Halas ran across the field and kicked him . He later blamed Halas for the loss stating " poor defensive strategy " . They had a similar incident during a game against the Green Bay Packers after Kindt miscalculated a play which led to touchdown and Halas kicked him in his knees . Kindt later claimed that Halas apologized for the incidents . He was selected to the 1954 Pro Bowl as a member of the West team , where he scored a safety after tackling Cleveland Browns quarterback Otto Graham during the second quarter . 
 In his career , Kindt appeared in 108 games with the Bears , intercepting 21 passes with 10 forced fumbles and one defensive touchdown . As a running back , Kindt had 172 carries for 586 yards and four touchdowns while as a receiver , he had 43 receptions for 506 yards and two touchdowns . 
 = = Later life = = 
 Kindt retired from football after the 1955 season to focus on a coaching career . In 1956 , Curly Lambeau named Kindt as one of the assistant coaches for his College All @-@ Stars squad , alongside future Hall of Famers Tony <unk> , and Mike <unk> to play against the Cleveland Browns in an exhibition game . Again he was named as a coach for the College All @-@ Stars in 1957 . Kindt was the person in charge of the University of Wisconsin alumni varsity football game in 1958 . He was married for over 50 years , and had three children , one of whom , Don Kindt , Jr. also played for the Chicago Bears in 1987 . After his brief coaching stint ended , Kindt became a salesperson for the Badger Meter Company in Milwaukee , retiring in 1988 . Kindt also dabbled with an acting career , appearing in amateur plays in his hometown .

 Banglapedia , or the National Encyclopedia of Bangladesh , is the first Bangladeshi encyclopedia . It is available in print , CD @-@ ROM format and online , in both Bengali and English . The print version comprises ten 500 @-@ page volumes . The first edition was published in January 2003 by the Asiatic Society of Bangladesh , with a plan to update it every two years . The second edition was issued in 2012 . 
 Banglapedia was not designed as a general encyclopedia but as a specialized encyclopedia on Bangladesh @-@ related topics . For the encyclopedia 's purposes , Bangladesh is defined as the territory comprising ancient Eastern India , Suba Bangla , Shahi Bangalah , Mughal Suba Bangla , Bengal Presidency , Bengal Province , East Bengal , East Pakistan , and the independent Bangladesh , in historical succession . 
 The encyclopedia 's chief editor is Sirajul Islam . Over 1200 writers and specialists in Bangladesh and abroad helped create the entries . Banglapedia has over 5 @,@ 700 entries in six editorial categories , each of which is overseen by an expert editor , as well as over 2 @,@ 000 single and four @-@ colour illustrations and 2 @,@ 100 cross @-@ references . 
 The project was funded by the Bangladeshi government , private sector organizations , academic institutes and the UNESCO . Though its original budget was 800 @,@ 000 taka ( roughly 10 @,@ 000 USD ) , the Asiatic Society eventually spent 80 million taka ( roughly 1 million USD ) on the project . Despite controversies over entries on the Bangladesh Liberation War and indigenous people , both the Bengali and English versions became popular upon publication . 
 = = Development = = 
 The Banglapedia project originated when the Asiatic Society of Bangladesh was working on a three @-@ volume study titled History of Bangladesh , 1704 @-@ 1971 in 1991 . The editors felt the need for a standard desk reference , as that project progressed laboriously , culling facts from various libraries . The idea finally led to a concept paper prepared by Sirajul Islam and his colleagues and submitted to the Asiatic Society of Bangladesh in early 1994 . The Banglapedia project was formally adopted on 19 February 1997 , and Islam was appointed project director and chief editor . As the head of the Project Implementation Committee , his task was to plan and manage the project funding . In 1996 , some three dozen committees were formed with three to four people in each committee to recommend the entries . Twenty @-@ seven thousand entries were proposed , requiring a 20 volume compendium . Because of financial constraints , the number of entries was cut down to around 6 @,@ 000 . The project officially took off in 1998 . 
 When the project began , the Society had only eight hundred thousand taka in its coffers for the project . Banglapedia raised further contributions from universities , banks , multinational companies , international organisations and even private individuals . A pool of agencies , including UNESCO , the University Grants Commission , universities , financial institutions and NGOs initially financed the project , which was completed at a cost of taka 80 million . Education Ministry funded about 74 % of the cost , while 26 % of the fund came mostly from universities and banks . Before direct sales started on 3 January 2003 , 4 @,@ 000 copies of the English version and all but 250 copies of the Bengali version were sold in advance out of the initial print of 5 @,@ 000 copies for each versions . For an additional run of 10 @,@ 000 prints people waited in queues outside the Asiatic Society office on the day of the release , and sales continued until 9 : 30 in the evening . A total of 4 @,@ 500 sets of the Bengali version and 2 @,@ 500 of the English version were sold on the day of release .

 The first attempt to compile a Bengali encyclopedia was undertaken by Felix Carey ( 1786 – 1822 ) , who was the son of Reverend William Carey ( 1761 – 1834 ) of Serampore and the first lexicographer of the Burmese language . In 1819 , he began the translation of the fifth edition of Encyclopædia Britannica , naming it <unk> . From October 1819 till November 1820 the book was printed by Felix Carey every month in 48 @-@ page installments . Thus completed , the first part of <unk> was compiled into the 638 @-@ page <unk> , the first book on anatomy and surgery in Bengali . Work on the second part , <unk> , which was largely on jurisprudence , then began . But , Carey died after only two 40 @-@ page installments were printed in February and March 1821 . 
 It was followed by Maharaja <unk> Dev Bahadur 's ( 1808 – 1974 ) <unk> <unk> ( 1833 ) , a concise encyclopedia . Then came Raja <unk> Deb 's <unk> ( 1822 – 1858 ) , a Sanskrit encyclopedic dictionary in eight parts . Next was <unk> Ray ( 1849 – 1894 ) and <unk> Dev 's ( 1858 @-@ unknown ) joint work <unk> , the first Bengali encyclopedia laid @-@ out in alphabetical order ( 1880 – 1892 ) published in three volumes . Reverend Krishna Mohan Banerjee 's ( 1813 – 1885 ) adaptation of Encyclopædia Britannica , <unk> or Encyclopædia <unk> ( 1846 – 51 ) , and the 22 @-@ volume Bangla <unk> ( 1886 – 1911 ) , edited by <unk> Basu ( 1866 – 1938 ) with contributions from many major personalities of contemporary Bengal , were published next . 
 After the independence of Pakistan and the partition of Bengal in 1947 , there have been more attempts to compile and publish an encyclopedia . The first was a project to produce a Bengali adaptation of Columbia Viking Desk Encyclopedia by Franklin Book Programs Inc . , undertaken in 1959 and aborted ten years later . The unfinished papers were compiled into four unequal volumes as Bangla <unk> ( 1972 ) with Khan Bahadur Abdul Hakim as the chief editor . After the independence of Bangladesh in 1971 , three specialized encyclopedias were published - the multi @-@ volume Islami <unk> ( Encyclopedia of Islam , 1986 ) by Islamic Foundation Bangladesh , 5 @-@ volume Shishu @-@ <unk> ( Encyclopedia for Children , 1995 ) by Bangladesh Shishu Academy , and 4 @-@ volume <unk> <unk> ( Encyclopedia of Science , 1998 ) by Bangla Academy .

 Banglapedia contains over 5 @,@ 700 entries , which are divided into six categories : arts and humanities , history and heritage , state and governance , society and economy , natural sciences , and biological sciences . The writing of each article was overseen by an expert editor . 
 Banglapedia was not designed as a general encyclopedia . Its purpose is to provide a standard desk reference for Bangladeshis , as well as for people interested in Bangladesh , Bengali @-@ speaking people , and related political , cultural and geographical contexts . 
 The encyclopedia 's editors intended to cover the rise of the Bengal Delta on the physical plane , and its evolution to date , and the changing features of the formation of the delta 's <unk> or human settlements on the human plane . The latter includes the rise and fall of kingdoms , invasions from within and beyond and their implications , dynastic rules and administration , as well as other aspects of Bangladesh 's past and present . Entries on topics after 1947 are restricted to the geographical region of Bangladesh . However , for biographical entries , the linguistic identity prevails . 
 The range of topics covered by Banglapedia includes political geography , religion , literature , art and architecture , folk practices and institutions , indigenous and colonial administration , politics , society , economy , ethnicity , and the sciences . All 64 districts of Bangladesh , as well as 451 upazilas , have been described in details ranging from topographical accounts to the number of dairy farms and hatcheries .

 According to the publisher , the goal of this reference tool is to inquire , interpret and integrate the lived experiences and achievements of the people of Bangladesh from ancient times to the present . The project , conceptually and territorially , interprets the term " Bangladesh " to mean successively ancient Eastern India , Suba Bangla , Shahi Bangalah , Mughal Suba Bangla , Bengal Presidency , Bengal Province , East Bengal , East Pakistan , and Bangladesh . The editor 's preface states : 
 From ancient times to 1971 , the political geography of the region has changed often , and with that its name has also undergone changes . The cognates of Vanga , Bangalah , <unk> , Bengal , <unk> , <unk> , etc. have the closest affinity both territorially and linguistically with the term Bangla . With the rise of Bangladesh as a sovereign nation state , the term has no doubt obtained a specific meaning . It may be noted here that the term Bangalah or <unk> , from which Bangla and Bengal originated , was coined and circulated by Muslim rulers whose seats of administration were located mostly within the present territory of Bangladesh .

 Over 1 @,@ 200 writers and specialists contributed to the encyclopedia , one fifth of whom were foreign experts in Bangladesh or experts working abroad . They are mostly academics , as well as specialists in districts and upazilas for locality inputs and people from professions and occupations . District and upazila cartography has been processed at the Geographic information system ( GIS ) and cartographic laboratory set up for the Banglapedia . A gazetteer group was created to focus on districts and upazilas . The fact that around 400 local intellectuals were charged with writing about their respective <unk> and upazilas was described as a unique approach to information gathering .

 Katori , named for a Shinto shrine in Katori City , was ordered in January 1904 from Vickers . The ship was laid down at their Barrow @-@ in @-@ Furness shipyard on 27 April 1904 . She was launched on 4 July 1905 , Prince and Princess Arisugawa were on hand for the official launching <unk> and completed on 20 May 1906 . Katori departed Britain on 7 June on her maiden voyage and shakedown cruise and arrived at Yokosuka on 15 August . 
 In a naval review off Yokosuka on 10 November 1913 , she served as the flagship for the Taishō Emperor . Katori occupied the German colony of Saipan , shortly after the start of World War I , on 14 October 1914 . Afterward the ship began a refit in 1914 that lasted until late 1916 and was assigned to the 2nd Battleship Squadron upon its completion . During this refit , two 12 @-@ pounder anti @-@ aircraft guns were replaced two of the low @-@ angle 12 @-@ pounders .

 On 3 March 1921 , Katori , escorted by Kashima , departed Yokohama bound for Great Britain carrying Crown Prince Hirohito , the first Japanese crown prince to travel abroad . The ships arrived at Portsmouth on 9 May and Hirohito left the ship to tour Europe ; he boarded the battleship again in Naples several months later for the voyage home . The ship was disarmed in April 1922 , stricken from the Navy List on 20 September 1923 and scrapped at Maizuru Naval <unk> by 29 January 1925 to comply with the terms of the Washington Naval Treaty . 
 = Joel Palmer = 
 General Joel Palmer ( October 4 , 1810 – June 9 , 1881 ) was an American pioneer of the Oregon Territory in the Pacific Northwest region of North America . He was born in Canada , and spent his early years in New York and Pennsylvania before serving as a member of the Indiana House of Representatives . 
 Palmer traveled to the Oregon Country in 1845 . He played a central role in blazing the last leg of the Oregon Trail , the Barlow Road , with Sam Barlow and others . Specifically , Palmer is noted for having climbed high on Mount Hood to observe the surrounding area when the party ran into difficulty . He wrote a popular immigrant guidebook , co @-@ founded Dayton , Oregon , and served as a controversial Indian Affairs administrator . After Oregon became a state , Palmer served in both branches of the Oregon Legislative Assembly . He was selected as Speaker of the Oregon House of Representatives for one session in 1862 , and in 1870 lost a bid to become Governor of Oregon . 
 The Palmer House , his former home in Dayton , was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987 . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Joel Palmer was born in Elizabethtown , Ontario , Canada , on October 4 , 1810 . His parents , Hannah Phelps and Ephraim Palmer , were American Quakers . When he was two years old , they moved to New York 's Catskill Mountains in response to the War of 1812 . He received only three months of formal education in elementary school . In 1822 , when Palmer was 12 , his parents indentured him to the Haworth family for a period of four years . When he gained his freedom , he moved to Bucks County , Pennsylvania , to work on canals and bridges . 
 He was married to Catherine Coffee from 1830 until her death after childbirth . On October 8 , 1832 , Palmer became a United States citizen . Palmer married his second wife , Sarah Ann Derbyshire , in 1836 , and bought land near Laurel , Indiana , in the Whitewater Valley , where he supervised a construction project for a canal . In 1843 , he was elected as a Democrat to the Indiana House of Representatives for a one @-@ year term . Representing Franklin County , he was re @-@ elected to the legislature in 1844 . 
 = = Oregon pioneer = = 
 In the spring of 1845 , Palmer traveled to Oregon without his family , as captain of a wagon train of 23 wagons . Stephen Meek served as the train 's paid guide . Meek left the group at Fort Hall to lead some of the members on the Meek Cutoff . The remaining parts of the wagon train reached the end of the overland Oregon Trail at the Columbia River , and unwilling to wait for transport down the dangerous Cascade Rapids , Palmer 's party joined Sam Barlow 's party in a quest for passage through the Cascade Range around the south side of Mount Hood . Palmer climbed to the 9 @,@ 000 @-@ foot level of Mount Hood on October 7 , 1845 — with little food and the scant protection of moccasins — to scout a route off the mountains . This was Mount Hood 's first recorded climb ; the Palmer Glacier on the mountain is named for him . 
 Because of the onset of winter , the Barlow , Rector , and Palmer parties were forced to leave their wagons on the mountain 's eastern foothills . Palmer left on horseback for Oregon City , while Barlow and Rector blazed a trail to Oregon City on foot . Sam Barlow later returned with partner Philip Foster to establish the Mount Hood Toll Road , which became known as the Barlow Road . 
 In 1846 , Palmer returned to his family in Indiana and in 1847 he published his diary as Palmer 's Journal of Travels Over the Rocky Mountains , 1845 – 1846 . This book provided equipment guidance and comprehensive route information for those crossing the Oregon Trail . The publication also had a general description of the Oregon Country , a detailed description of the Willamette Valley , and included a copy of the Organic Laws of Oregon adopted by settlers at the Champoeg Meetings . It was a popular guidebook for immigrants for the next ten years . 
 Also in 1847 , Palmer traveled with his family to Oregon as captain of that year 's major wagon train . While passing through the Walla Walla Valley he met Marcus and Narcissa Whitman at their mission shortly before their deaths in the Whitman massacre — the event that precipitated the Cayuse War . Perhaps motivated by meeting the Whitmans , Palmer later returned to serve as a peace commissioner to tribes considering joining the Cayuse . At the outset of the war he was appointed as commissary @-@ general of the Provisional Government ’ s militia forces . 
 After the war , in 1848 , Palmer joined the California Gold Rush but returned in 1849 to co @-@ found Dayton , Oregon on the lower Yamhill River where he built a sawmill on his donation land claim . 
 = = Oregon politician = = 
 In 1853 , President Franklin Pierce appointed Palmer Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Oregon Territory . The debate of what to do with Native Americans ranged from full integration to total extermination . Palmer proved effective negotiating " Cessation of Hostility treaties " with the native tribes in 1854 and 1855 , brokering nine of fifteen treaties . He joined Isaac Stevens , his counterpart for the Washington Territory , in the successful Walla Walla Treaty Council of the Yakima Indian War . Approximately 5 @,@ 000 Indians attended deliberations from May 29 , 1855 to June 11 , 1855 . 
 Palmer gained an anti @-@ settler reputation among immigrants , newspapers and officials , who said he acted too favorably toward the Indians , even though he moved the tribes to reservations outside the Willamette Valley , seeking to avoid friction between settlers and natives by physical distance . In late 1855 , while moving the Rogue River tribes to the Grand Ronde Reservation , violent resistance was threatened by settlers who felt the land should not be given to the tribes . Palmer succeeded , but the territorial legislature petitioned for his removal from office , which became effective in 1857 . 
 After leaving office as Indian Affairs Superintendent , Palmer worked his farm on his land claim and operated his sawmill and several other enterprises . Between 1858 and 1861 he spent time in British Columbia as a merchant to prospectors in the gold rushes of the Thompson River , Similkameen Valley , and Fraser River . Palmer blazed a route to the gold fields of the Okanogan Valley and the upper portions of the Columbia River from Priest Rapids in 1860 . In 1862 , he was elected to the Oregon House of Representatives to represent Yamhill County . Now a member of the Republican Party , he was named Speaker of the House during that session . 
 That year Palmer also established the Columbia River Road Company to build a trail through the Columbia River Gorge on the Oregon side of the river . In 1864 , Palmer was elected to the State Senate and served in that chamber through 1866 . This included the 1865 special session of the legislature when Oregon adopted the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution that abolished slavery throughout the United States . He ran for governor in the 1870 election as the Republican candidate , but was narrowly defeated by La Fayette Grover , largely for his Indian policies .

 Palmer 's brother , named Ephraim like their father , also immigrated to Oregon and served as a captain in the first regiment of the Oregon Infantry . In 1871 , Joel was the state 's Indian agent to the Siletz tribe , remaining in the office until 1873 . All eight of Palmer 's children completed higher education . Joel Palmer died in Dayton on June 9 , 1881 , at the age of 70 . His former home that he built in 1852 , Palmer House , was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1987 , and is now operating as a restaurant .

On his return , he dreams of giving back to society with free medical treatment and education . However his plans face a roadblock in the form of the influential businessman , Adiseshan . When corruption also arises , Sivaji is left with no option but to fight the system in his own way . 
 The film was initially scheduled for release on 14 April 2007 ( Tamil New Year ) , but due to post @-@ production delays , it was released worldwide on 15 June 2007 in Tamil , and subsequently released in Telugu as a dubbed version on the same date .

 = = Plot = = 
 Sivaji , an Indian software architect , returns to India from the United States . He aims to establish a non @-@ profit trust called the Sivaji Foundation to build a network of hospitals and educational institutions to serve the poor free of charge . However , the influential businessman Adiseshan sees Sivaji as his competitor with the fact of the matter being that he runs profit @-@ making educational institutions and hospitals . Sivaji is forced to bribe the corrupt civil service , but eventually , the bribes demanded become so high that he has to mortgage his house and sell his car to pay them . When Sivaji goes to court , he loses the case filed against him by Adiseshan regarding the methods Sivaji had used to open his foundation as a result of bribing numerous government officials . Simultaneously , Sivaji falls in love with a girl named Tamizhselvi . However , upon asking for his horoscope , an astrologer warns that their union will result in Sivaji 's death . When Tamizhselvi refuses the proposal due to her concern for Sivaji , he calms her fears and convinces her to marry him . 
 Following the loss in the court case , Tamizhselvi requests Sivaji out of fear not to come for her again . Sivaji is reduced to poverty . In revenge , Sivaji acquires evidence of ₹ 2 billion worth of illegal earnings in the possession of Adiseshan and uses the documents to blackmail him into giving him half the money . He further obtains details on people who have similar amounts of illegal earnings across Tamil Nadu , and blackmails them to give him half of their illegal wealth . He then transfers the money to the bank accounts of his friends around the world by " <unk> " forgery . They then deposit the money as donations to Sivaji Foundation , making the money usable and legitimate . 
 Sivaji then informs the Income Tax Investigation and Vigilance Department about the details of the illegal money held by the tax evaders ( including Adiseshan ) and gets them arrested . He reopens the foundation , and soon is able to provide free , good quality education , infrastructure , services and employment to people in every district of Tamil Nadu . Led by Adiseshan , those who Sivaji blackmailed exploit Tamizhselvi 's innocence to silence him . Fearing for Sivaji 's life , she hands over Sivaji 's laptop to CBI and Income Tax officers hired by Adiseshan with all the information regarding the illegal money transactions . With presentable evidence , Sivaji is arrested . 
 At the jail , Adiseshan and the police force Sivaji to unlock his laptop . When Sivaji refuses , Adiseshan assaults him , leaving him for dead . To cover this up , Adiseshan and the police organise for thugs to shoot at the police van that will carry Sivaji 's corpse , making it look like murder by a third party . Sivaji , however , is faking ; he was informed of the plans to kill him by a sympathetic police constable prior to the interrogation . Left alone in the room , he electrifies himself . Sivaji 's friend Dr. Chezhian and Tamizhselvi intercept the police van after being informed by Sivaji through a MMS and replace Sivaji 's body with a dummy before the thugs open fire . While everyone thinks that Sivaji is dead , Chezhian revives him using a defibrillator . Following Sivaji 's " death " , Adiseshan and the CBI still try to open Sivaji 's laptop by trying to fool the voice @-@ detection program ; this fails and all the data in the laptop is erased . 
 A few days later , while everyone wonders about the future of Sivaji Foundation , the revived Sivaji returns to take control of the foundation in the guise of a friend , M. G. Ravichandran . Though Adiseshan immediately realises that Ravichandran is actually Sivaji , he is unable to prove this to the police due to the tangible evidence of Sivaji 's " death " ( his death being certified by a government hospital ) . " Ravichandran " promises to avenge Sivaji 's " death " and eventually manages to corner Adiseshan in the terrace of his medical college and fights him . During the fight , Adiseshan inadvertently strikes the roof of his campus 's terrace causing money hidden in the roof to fly around the campus . The students who spot the money go after them causing a stampede ; Adiseshan is killed in the stampede . Sivaji Foundation soon becomes a frontier for India 's economic and industrial rise .

 Following the success of his film Jeans ( 1998 ) , S. Shankar wrote a script for his next film titled Mudhalvan ( 1999 ) having Rajinikanth in mind for the lead role . However , Rajinikanth could not act in the film due to schedule conflicts with Padayappa ( 1999 ) . Hence the role went to Arjun Sarja . Post Anniyan ( 2005 ) , Shankar decided to take a break before preparing for his next project . 
 In August 2005 , Rajinikanth signed up for his next film which was to be produced by Chennai 's oldest operative studio , AVM Productions , which was run by M. S. Guhan and M. Saravanan . This time Shankar was confirmed to be the film 's director . After consulting Sivaji Ganesan 's family to avoid any issues with the film 's name , the project was subsequently announced on 24 August 2005 . The film was titled Sivaji , after Rajinikanth 's name at birth – Sivaji Rao Gaekwad . A tagline , The Boss , which stands for " Bachelor of Social Service " , was suffixed to the title . 
 In addition to being AVM Productions ' 168th film , Sivaji was also Rajinikanth 's 154th film , his 100th Tamil film and his ninth film with AVM Productions . According to Rajinikanth 's biographer Naman Ramachandran , the film was also made to commemorate the 100th birth anniversary of the production company 's founder , A. V. Meiyappan . Sivaji was also noted for its change in the traditional yellow coloured Rajinikanth introductory text which made its debut with Annamalai . Instead the text is displayed in Chrome .

 In October 2005 , Shankar and Rajinikanth announced that actress Shriya Saran would play the female lead role . Saran 's voice was dubbed by actress Kanika , who was selected after a successful voice test , thereby collaborating for the second time with Shankar . Actor Vivek was signed up for the role of Sivaji 's maternal uncle , Arivu , in November 2005 . Actress Sunaina made her acting debut through this film in a special appearance , however the scene was later deleted and her role was left uncredited . Nayantara , who had earlier worked with Rajinikanth in Chandramukhi , was signed up to perform alongside Rajinikanth in the song " <unk> " . 
 Suman was confirmed in March 2006 to play the role of Adiseshan after Amitabh Bachchan , Prakash Raj and Mohanlal were considered . For his role , Suman removed his moustache and used dentures to make his smile visible . Shankar instructed one of the costume designers to give the character a spotless white dhoti , shirt , shoes , a Rolex watch and Ray @-@ Ban sunglasses . Prior to this , Suman had acted with Rajinikanth in Thee ( 1981 ) . Subbu Panchu Arunachalam , son of filmmaker Panchu Arunachalam , dubbed for Suman . Debate speakers Solomon <unk> and <unk> Raja were selected to play supporting roles making their cinematic acting debut . <unk> and Manivannan were selected to play Sivaji 's parents . Raghuvaran appeared in a small role as Dr. Chezhian . 
 Shankar , who also wrote the film 's story and screenplay , was paid a then record salary of ₹ 30 million ( Indian rupees ) for the project . A. R. Rahman , who was selected to compose the film 's soundtrack and background score , was also paid ₹ 30 million . Sujatha Rangarajan was assigned to write the dialogues for Sivaji . Tha . Prabhu Raja Cholan , who would later direct the film <unk> ( 2013 ) , worked as an assistant director in this film . Rajinikanth 's daughter Soundarya worked as a graphics designer , creating the title for this film ; she had earlier worked in the same position on two of her father 's films – Baba ( 2002 ) and Chandramukhi ( 2005 ) . K. V. Anand was hired as the cinematographer in August 2005 . Manish Malhotra was responsible for designing the film 's costumes , while Anthony and Thota Tharani were the editor and art director respectively . Additional make @-@ up for Rajinikanth was done by make @-@ up artist Banu . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Principal photography commenced on 28 November 2005 with a puja at AVM Productions . The film 's launch was a secret event , with only pivotal members of the cast and crew being called for the event 's attendance . The first schedule of Sivaji began on 14 December 2005 with the song " Vaaji Vaaji " featuring Rajinikanth and Saran being shot at Ramoji Film City in Hyderabad . The idea of shooting at Ramoji Film City was suggested to Shankar by Tharani who felt that the place offered a lot of scope for him to utilise his skills and experience as an art director . " Vaaji Vaaji " was picturised with an intention to showcase a Babylonian palace setting when Shankar requested Tharani to show " a palace with lots of colour " . Tharani created a four @-@ storey Babylonian palace to accommodate 80 dancers and 100 junior artists for the number . Shooting of the number , which according to K. V. Anand was filmed in Super 35 motion picture film format , was completed in eight days . G. Dhananjayan mentions in his book The Best of Tamil Cinema that ₹ 35 million was spent on the song 's making . 
 Tharani described the set designing for the song " <unk> " , which was also shot at Ramoji Film City , as " extremely challenging " . After listening to the lyrics of the song which speaks of the four traditional calendar seasons , Tharani thought of using a concept titled Living in Seasons , which he used at a symposium held in Japan . For the set 's design which depicted the four seasons , Tharani proposed three concepts – a traditional Japanese house , a contemporary house and a futuristic house . Shankar chose the futuristic house concept , which consisted of three domes in the shapes of a square , a circle and a pyramid adjacent to one another . The circular dome had a pathway around it and water falling from a 50 feet high rock , which would seep under the set . Tharani made use of acrylic glass and normal glass with the former being implemented on the floor to make the dance movements more easier to perform . Construction of the set for the number was completed in 30 days . 
 In addition to these two songs , Tharani contributed to similar creations for the music store where Tamizhselvi works as a saleswoman , the street surrounding the music store , the warehouse behind the music store , the interior portions of Thamizhselvi 's house and Adiseshan 's office room . The music shop was designed in the Victorian architecture style , while the warehouse was constructed at AVM Productions with the fight sequence being filmed there as well . Filming of another action sequence in an open @-@ air theatre , which was also designed by Tharani , took place for approximately 15 – 20 days . K. V. Anand used balloon lights brought from a French company <unk> Space Lighting for the sequence . The interior portions of Thamizhselvi 's house was designed using clippings of flats constructed by the Tamil Nadu Housing Board . 
 The " Style " segment was filmed in May 2006 at the Frank Gehry @-@ designed Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao , Spain . The fair look of Rajinikanth 's character in the segment was created using computer @-@ generated imagery , which was performed by V. Srinivas Mohan , the head of the Chennai @-@ based firm Indian Artists . K. V. Anand re @-@ shot every single movement of Rajinikanth with a British woman named Jacky , who was also one of the song 's background dancers . All the shots featuring Rajinikanth in the song and those featuring Jacky were scanned in 4K resolution to enhance their clarity after which Jacky 's skin colour was digitally implemented onto Rajinikanth 's skin . French hair @-@ stylist <unk> <unk> Seth designed two distinct hair @-@ styles for the entire film and 13 hair @-@ styles for the segment alone . In order to avoid disruptions that could occur at the shooting spot due to Rajinikanth 's fan following in Tamil Nadu , Brinda choreographed " <unk> " , Rajinikanth 's introduction song sequence in Wai , a hill station near Pune with 500 people for eight days . To add more colour to the sequence , a 50 @-@ member team of Puli Kali artists from Thrissur were employed by Shankar as background dancers . 
 In November 2006 , sequences featuring <unk> , Saran and Vivek were shot at the Pune Junction railway station . Filming of a key portion involving Rajinikanth and Vivek took place in the Victoria Public Hall building in Chennai . A fight sequence and the song " Athiradi " were filmed at Binny Mills . The sets for the song were made bearing resemblance to the city of Venice . For the climax scenes , which were filmed at the <unk> city SEZ towers , Rajinikanth tonsured his head . The scenes where Sivaji gets the money he transferred to his friends by forgery were filmed in New York . The completion of those scenes in February 2007 marked the end of the principal photography . The climactic fight between Sivaji and Adiseshan was filmed at Vels University . K. V. Anand told Shobha Warrier of Rediff that the portions other than the songs and action sequences were completed in 65 days . 
 = = Themes and influences = = 
 Many critics stated that the theme of the film has been inspired from director 's previous films Gentleman ( 1993 ) and Mudhalvan ( 1999 ) . The film deals with the concept of corruption and money laundering and how the film 's protagonist employs methods to get rid of those elements . 
 Sivaji , who is a software engineer is frustrated with the corruption in India which is shown in the scene where he watches the pitiable condition of poor people stating that : " The rich get richer , the poor get poorer " . Sivaji 's love for his country is also illustrated in a scene where he is advised by his uncle to go back to abroad but he says " Where else will I go ? This is home . "

 Malathi Rangarajan of the The Hindu , in a review about the story , said that the lead character carrying out a rebellion against corruption was something " not be true to life " . She concluded by saying that " the story sags towards the end " . She , however , appreciated the performances of the prominent actors , the soundtrack , art direction , photography and the animation . <unk> Krishnan , another review from The Hindu , a month after the film 's release , said that the film " ... presents an effective diagnosis of entrenched corruption but the rather disturbing remedy it offers is , good old vigilantism . " It concluded by saying that , though the film did well at the box @-@ office , the message of rejecting the corrupt system instead of reforming it was troubling . T. S. V. Hari of Hindustan Times said that the director , Shankar , was not creative enough for the film and added this by saying " Sivaji turns out to be a rehash of all his previous jingoistic claptrap efforts " . It appreciated the other technical departments and suggested a good response at the box office . The Times of India had a similar review about the story saying that " it had nothing new to offer " but promised it to be entertaining and gave it four stars . 
 R G Vijayasarathy of Rediff.com summed the film by saying , " No logic , only Rajni 's magic " . About the story , he said , " Unfortunately , ( the ) message is lost in the maze of illogical and sometimes absurd sequences " . The review , however , praised the performances of Rajinikanth , Shriya and Vivek and the technical crew . A. R. Rahman 's score and Shankar 's directorial abilities were also lauded in the review . Sify wrote : " There is only one hero here , [ .. ] - Rajni himself . Such is the overpowering screen presence of his cinematic charisma in every frame of the film .

 = Hurricane Andrew = 
 Hurricane Andrew was , at the time of its occurrence in August 1992 , the most destructive hurricane in United States history . It caused major damage in the Bahamas and Louisiana , but the greatest impact was in South Florida , where it made landfall at Category 5 hurricane intensity on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane scale , with wind speeds up to 165 mph ( 270 km / h ) . Passing directly through the town of Homestead , Florida , a suburb south of Miami , Andrew obliterated entire blocks of homes , in many cases leaving only the concrete foundations . Over 25 @,@ 000 houses were destroyed in Miami @-@ Dade County alone , and nearly 100 @,@ 000 more were severely damaged . The damage total across the affected regions exceeded $ 26 billion ( 1992 USD ) , and 65 people lost their lives in the hurricane . 
 Andrew originated from a tropical wave over the central Atlantic , becoming the fourth tropical cyclone and the first hurricane of the 1992 Atlantic hurricane season . Initially , strong wind shear prevented much intensification , but after turning westward , Andrew entered a stage of rapid intensification ; it peaked as a powerful Category 5 hurricane near the Bahamas on August 23 . Though it briefly weakened to Category 4 strength while traversing the island nation , Andrew regained its Category 5 status before making two separate landfalls in South Florida — the first on Elliott Key and the second in Homestead . In Miami @-@ Dade County alone , damage was originally estimated at $ 25 billion ( 1992 USD ) . Several hours later , the hurricane emerged over the Gulf of Mexico at Category 4 strength , with the Gulf Coast of the United States in its projected path . After weakening slightly , Andrew moved ashore near Morgan City , Louisiana , as low @-@ end Category 3 storm . The effects of land caused the small hurricane to rapidly lose its intensity , and it diminished to a depression by August 27 while crossing Mississippi . The next day , Andrew merged with a frontal system over the southern Appalachian Mountains . 
 In the Bahamas , Andrew brought storm surge , hurricane @-@ force winds , and tornadoes , causing widespread structural damage , especially on Cat Cays . About 800 houses were destroyed in the archipelago , and there was substantial damage to the transport , water , sanitation , agriculture , and fishing sectors . Overall , Andrew left four dead and $ 250 million ( 1992 USD ) in damage throughout the Bahamas . In parts of southern Florida , Andrew produced severe winds ; a wind gust of 177 mph ( 282 km / h ) was observed at a house in Perrine . These winds wreaked catastrophic damage in Florida — Miami @-@ Dade County cities of Florida City , Homestead , and Cutler Ridge receiving the brunt of the storm . A total of 63 @,@ 000 homes were destroyed and more than 101 @,@ 000 others were damaged , leaving roughly 175 @,@ 000 people homeless . As many as 1 @.@ 4 million people lost power at the height of the storm . In the Everglades , 70 @,@ 000 acres ( 280 km2 ) of trees were downed . Rainfall in Florida was substantial , peaking at 13 @.@ 98 in ( 355 mm ) in western Miami @-@ Dade County . Altogether , Andrew killed 44 and left a record $ 25 billion in damage in the state . 
 Before moving ashore Andrew caused extensive damage to oil platforms in the Gulf of Mexico , leading to $ 500 million in losses for oil companies . It produced hurricane @-@ force winds along its path through Louisiana , leaving about 152 @,@ 000 without electricity . Over 80 % of trees in the Atchafalaya River Basin were downed , and the agriculture there was devastated . Throughout the basin and Bayou Lafourche , 187 million freshwater fish were killed in the hurricane . An F3 tornado in St. John the Baptist Parish wrecked 163 structures . With 23 @,@ 000 houses damaged , 985 others destroyed , and 1 @,@ 951 mobile homes demolished , property losses in Louisiana exceeded $ 1 @.@ 5 billion . The hurricane caused the deaths of 17 people in the state , six of whom drowned offshore . 
 Andrew spawned at least 28 tornadoes along the Gulf Coast , especially in Alabama , Georgia , and Mississippi . Throughout its path , Andrew left 65 dead and $ 26 billion in damage ( 1992 USD , $ 43 @.@ 8 billion 2016 USD ) ; it is currently the fourth costliest hurricane in Atlantic hurricane history , behind only hurricanes Katrina and Wilma in 2005 , Ike in 2008 , and Sandy in 2012 . Some sources put the damage from Andrew as high as $ 34 billion ( 1992 USD , $ 57 @.@ 3 billion 2016 USD ) . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A tropical wave moved off the coast of Africa on August 14 . Under the influence of a ridge of high pressure to its north , the wave tracked quickly westward . An area of convection developed along the wave axis to the south of the Cape Verde islands , and on August 15 , meteorologists began classifying the system with the Dvorak technique . The thunderstorm activity became more concentrated , and narrow spiral rainbands developed around a developing center of circulation . Based on a Dvorak T @-@ number of 2 @.@ 0 , it is estimated that Tropical Depression Three developed late on August 16 , while about 1 @,@ 630 miles ( 2 @,@ 620 km ) east @-@ southeast of Barbados . Embedded within the deep easterlies , the depression tracked west @-@ northwestward at 20 mph ( 32 km / h ) . Initially , moderate wind shear prevented strengthening , until a decrease in shear allowed the depression to intensify into Tropical Storm Andrew at 1200 UTC on August 17 . 
 By early August 18 , the storm maintained concentrated convection near the center with spiral bands to its west as the winds increased to 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) . Shortly thereafter the thunderstorms decreased markedly during the diurnal minimum and as the storm turned to the northwest , increased southwesterly wind shear from an upper @-@ level low prevented Andrew from maintaining deep convection . On August 19 , a Hurricane Hunters flight into the storm failed to locate a well @-@ defined center and on the following day , a flight found that the cyclone had degenerated to the extent that only a diffuse low @-@ level circulation center remained ; observations indicated the pressure rose to an unusually high 1 @,@ 015 mbar ( 30 @.@ 0 inHg ) . The flight indicated Andrew maintained a vigorous circulation aloft , with winds of 80 mph ( 130 km / h ) recorded at flight level . Subsequently , the upper @-@ level low weakened and split into a trough , which decreased the wind shear over the storm . Simultaneously , a strong high pressure cell developed over the southeastern United States , which built eastward and caused Andrew to turn to the west . Convection became more organized as upper @-@ level outflow became better established . An eye formed , and Andrew attained hurricane status early on August 22 , while located about 650 miles ( 1 @,@ 050 km ) east @-@ southeast of Nassau , Bahamas . Six hours after becoming a hurricane , Andrew was predicted to make landfall near Jupiter , Florida with winds of 105 mph ( 169 km / h ) . 
 The hurricane accelerated as it tracked due westward into an area of very favorable conditions , and began to rapidly intensify late on August 22 ; in a 24 ‑ hour period the atmospheric pressure dropped by 47 mbar ( 47 hPa ; 1 @.@ 4 inHg ) to a minimum of 922 mbar ( 922 hPa ; 27 @.@ 2 inHg ) . On August 23 , the storm attained Category 5 status on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane scale , and at 1800 UTC , Andrew reached peak winds of 175 mph ( 280 km / h ) while located a short distance off Eleuthera island in the Bahamas . Operationally , the National Hurricane Center assessed its peak intensity as 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) , which was upgraded to 155 mph ( 249 km / h ) in a post @-@ analysis after the season ended ; the hurricane was later re @-@ classified as a Category 5 hurricane . Even with winds of 175 mph ( 280 km / h ) , Andrew was a small tropical cyclone , with winds of 35 mph ( 56 km / h ) extending out only about 90 miles ( 140 km ) from its center . After reaching that intensity , the hurricane underwent an eyewall replacement cycle . At 2100 UTC on August 23 , Andrew made landfall on Eleuthera with winds of 160 mph ( 260 km / h ) . The cyclone weakened further while crossing the Bahama Banks , and at 0100 UTC on August 24 , Andrew hit the southern Berry Islands of the Bahamas with winds of 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) . As it crossed over the warm waters of the Gulf Stream , the hurricane rapidly re @-@ intensified as the eye decreased in size and its eyewall convection deepened . At 0840 UTC on August 24 , Andrew struck Elliott Key with winds of 165 mph ( 266 km / h ) and a pressure of 926 mbar ( 27 @.@ 3 inHg ) . About 25 minutes after its first Florida landfall , Andrew hit just northeast of Homestead with a slightly lower pressure of 922 mbar ( 922 hPa ; 27 @.@ 2 inHg ) . 
 As the eye moved onshore in Florida , the convection in the eyewall strengthened due to increased convergence , and Hurricane Hunters reported a warmer eyewall temperature than two hours prior . However , Andrew weakened as it continued further inland , and after crossing southern Florida in four hours , the storm emerged into the Gulf of Mexico with winds of 135 mph ( 217 km / h ) . In the Gulf of Mexico , the eye remained well @-@ defined as the hurricane turned to the west @-@ northwest , a change due to the weakening of the ridge to its north . Andrew steadily re @-@ intensified over the Gulf of Mexico , reaching winds of 145 mph ( 233 km / h ) late on August 25 . As the high pressure system to its north weakened , a strong mid @-@ latitude trough approached the area from the northwest . This caused the hurricane to decelerate to the northwest , and winds decreased as Andrew approached the Gulf Coast of the United States . At 0830 UTC on August 26 , the cyclone made its final landfall in a sparsely populated area of Louisiana about 20 miles ( 32 km ) west @-@ southwest of Morgan City with winds of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) . Hurricane Andrew weakened rapidly as it turned to the north and northeast , falling to tropical storm intensity within ten hours . After entering Mississippi , the cyclone deteriorated to tropical depression status early on August 27 . Accelerating northeastward , the depression began merging with the approaching frontal system , and by midday on August 28 , Andrew ceased to meet the qualifications of a tropical cyclone while located over the southern Appalachian Mountains . The remnants continued moving towards northeast and lost its identity on August 28 , while merging with the remnants of Hurricane Lester within the frontal zone over the Mid @-@ Atlantic states .

 Before the hurricane passed through the Bahamas , forecasters predicted a storm surge of up to 18 ft ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) , as well as up to 8 in ( 200 mm ) of rain . On August 22 , hurricane watches were issued from Andros and Eleuthera islands northward through Grand Bahama and Great Abaco . They were upgraded to hurricane warnings later that day , and on August 23 , additional warnings were issued for the central Bahamas , including Cat Island , Exuma , San Salvador Island , and Long Island . All watches and warnings were discontinued on August 24 . Advance warning was credited for the low death toll in the country . 
 = = = Florida = = = 
 Initially , forecasters predicted tides up to 14 feet ( 4 @.@ 3 m ) above normal along the east coast of Florida , near the potential location of landfall . The National Hurricane Center later noted that storm surge up to 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) would occur along the east coast of Florida , as high as 13 feet ( 4 @.@ 0 m ) in Biscayne Bay , and to a height of 11 feet ( 3 @.@ 4 m ) of the west coast of Florida . Rainfall was predicted to be between 5 and 8 inches ( 130 and 200 mm ) along the path of the storm . In addition , the National Hurricane Center noted the likelihood of isolated tornadoes in Central and Southern Florida during the passage of Andrew on August 23 and August 24 . 
 Late on August 22 , a hurricane watch was issued for the east coast of Florida from Titusville to the Florida Keys , which included Dry Tortugas . On the following day , a hurricane warning was posted from Vero Beach southward to the Florida Keys , including Dry Tortugas . To the north , the east coast of Florida from Vero Beach to Titusville was placed under a tropical storm warning on August 23 . Simultaneously , a hurricane watch was issued for the west coast of Florida from Bayport southward to near Flamingo . Later that day , the portion to the south of Venice was upgraded to a hurricane warning and was expanded to include Lake Okeechobee . To the north of Venice , the hurricane watch was downgraded to a tropical storm warning . By 1800 UTC on August 24 , all watches and warnings issued in anticipation of the storm were discontinued . 
 Evacuations were ordered in nine counties : Broward , Charlotte , Collier , Lee , Martin , Miami @-@ Dade , Monroe , Palm Beach , and Sarasota . In addition , officials in Lee County recommended an evacuation for the county on August 23 , about 20 hours before tropical storm force winds were reported there . Overall , almost 1 @.@ 2 million people evacuated , which contributed to low number of fatalities , despite the intensity of the storm . United States Coast Guard vessels on or near the Florida coastline were either secured onshore or sent to ride out the storm at sea . As Andrew was approaching , an estimated 20 @,@ 000 @-@ 30 @,@ 000 tourists were in the Florida Keys ( Monroe County ) . Ultimately , the sheer number of evacuees led to likely the largest traffic jam in the history of Florida , mostly along Interstate 95 .

 While the hurricane was approaching the Gulf Coast of the United States , the National Hurricane Center issued a hurricane watch from Mobile , Alabama to Vermilion Bay , Louisiana , about 43 hours before landfall . Eight hours later , the agency upgraded the watch to a warning from Pascagoula , Mississippi to Vermilion Bay , which was later extended to Bolivar Peninsula , Texas . Due to the hurricane 's threat , about 1 @.@ 25 million people evacuated the Louisiana coast , and another 250 @,@ 000 people evacuated from Orange and Jefferson counties in Texas .

 Though Andrew was a small tropical cyclone for most of its lifespan , it caused extreme damage , especially in the Bahamas , Florida , and Louisiana . The vast majority of the damage was as a result of extremely high winds , although a few tornadoes spawned by Andrew caused considerable damage in Louisiana . Throughout the areas affected , almost 177 @,@ 000 people were left homeless . Outside of the Bahamas , Florida , and Louisiana , effects were widespread , although damage was minimal . Overall , $ 26 @.@ 5 billion in losses and 65 fatalities were attributed to Andrew . Many other estimates , however , indicate Andrew caused next to $ 34 billion in damage overall . As a result of damage in Florida and Louisiana , Andrew was listed as the costliest hurricane in U.S. history , but is now fourth following Hurricanes Katrina ( 2005 ) , Sandy ( 2012 ) , and Ike ( 2008 ) . 
 = = = Bahamas = = = 
 In the Bahamas , Andrew produced hurricane @-@ force winds in North Eleuthera , New Providence , North Andros , Bimini , Berry Islands . The storm first struck Eleuthera , where it produced a high storm surge that was described as a " mighty wall of water " . At The Current , a small village in the northwestern portion of the island , more than half of the houses were destroyed and the rest of the buildings sustained minor to major damage . One person drowned from the surge in Lower Bogue , Eleuthera , and two others died in nearby The Bluff . On Current Island , the hurricane destroyed 24 of the 30 houses . Harbour Island , also situated near Eleuthera , reported wind gusts of 138 mph ( 222 km / h ) – the strongest gust speed observed in the Bahamas during Andrew 's passage . News reports indicated severe damage to 36 houses on Harbor Island . 
 The hurricane produced several tornadoes in the area . At the capital city of Nassau , sustained winds reached 92 mph ( 148 km / h ) , while gusts up to 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) were reported . According to the Bahamas Red Cross , only minor damage occurred in Nassau . However , on the private island of Cat Cay , many expensive homes sustained heavy damage . Much of the northwestern Bahamas received damage , with estimates reaching $ 250 million . A total of 800 houses were destroyed , leaving 1 @,@ 700 people homeless . Additionally , the storm cause severe damage to the sectors of transport , communications , water , sanitation , agriculture , and fishing . Four deaths in the country were attributed to the hurricane , of which three were direct ; the indirect fatality was due to heart failure during the passage of the storm .

 Tides were generally between only 4 to 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 2 to 1 @.@ 8 m ) above normal in the Biscayne Bay area , though near the Burger King International Headquarters , tides reached as high as 16 @.@ 9 feet ( 5 @.@ 2 m ) above normal . Storm surge on the west coast was widespread , but mostly light , with a peak height of 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) , measured at both Everglades City and Goodland . The storm surge was reported as far north as Homosassa . Strong winds from the storm were confined to a relatively small area , stretching from Key Largo to about Miami Beach . A house in Perrine initially reported a wind gust of 212 mph ( 341 km / h ) ; this measurement was reduced to 177 mph ( 285 km / h ) , after a wind @-@ tunnel testing at Clemson University of the same type of anemometer revealed a 16 @.@ 5 % error . At some locations , the instruments measuring wind speeds failed before the highest winds occurred . At the National Hurricane Center , sustained winds of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) and gusts to 164 mph ( 264 km / h ) were measured before the anemometer failed . The highest sustained wind speed in relation to the storm was 146 mph ( 235 km / h ) , recorded at the Turkey Point Nuclear Generating Station , before instruments failed there , too . In Key Largo , a 13 @-@ minute wind speed of 114 mph ( 183 km / h ) was reported . Tropical storm force winds reached as far north as West Palm Beach . On the west coast of Florida , sustained winds did not exceed 39 mph ( 63 km / h ) at Marco Island , though a wind gust of 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) was reported in Collier County . Rainfall was generally light , possibly as a result of the storm 's relatively fast movement . Overall , precipitation from Andrew peaked at nearly 14 inches ( 360 mm ) in western Miami @-@ Dade County . Heavy rainfall in other areas was sporadic , with precipitation reported as far north as Central Florida . 
 Storm surge from Andrew caused more than $ 500 million in losses to boats and a hotel , which had its lobby flooded with 2 to 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 61 to 0 @.@ 91 m ) of water . Almost all the damage in Florida was caused by strong winds . Although effects from Andrew were catastrophic , the extent of damage was limited mainly from Kendall to Key Largo due to the small wind field of the storm . At the height of the storm , more than 1 @.@ 4 million people lost electricity and another 150 @,@ 000 were without telephone service . It is estimated that throughout Florida some 63 @,@ 000 homes were destroyed , leaving at least 175 @,@ 000 people homeless . In addition to homes , the storm damaged or destroyed 82 @,@ 000 businesses , 32 @,@ 900 acres of farmland , 31 public schools , 59 health facilities / hospitals , 9 @,@ 500 traffic signals , 3 @,@ 300 miles ( 5 @,@ 300 km ) of power lines , and 3 @,@ 000 <unk> . At the Homestead Air Force Base , re @-@ opened two years later as Homestead Air Reserve Base , most of the 2 @,@ 000 buildings on the base became " severely damaged or unusable " . The Cutler Ridge Mall suffered severe wind and water damage ; after the storm , significant looting was reported at that location . In Everglades National Park and Biscayne National Park , more than 25 % of trees were damaged or destroyed , including one @-@ fourth of the royal palms and one @-@ third of the pine trees in the former . 
 Some officials in Florida considered Andrew the worst storm in the state since the Labor Day hurricane in 1935 . Within Miami @-@ Dade County alone , the storm destroyed about 25 @,@ 524 homes and damaged 101 @,@ 241 others . Additionally , 90 % of mobile homes in the county were destroyed , while the destruction of 99 % of mobile homes occurred in Homestead . More than 50 streets were blocked by fallen trees and power lines . Approximately 20 million cubic yards of debris left by the storm were disposed of . Outside of Miami @-@ Dade County , effects were relatively minimal , except in Broward , Monroe , and Collier counties . In Broward County , property damage reached about $ 100 million and three fatalities were reported . In addition to the damage at Everglades National Park , effects in Monroe County were significant , especially in the Upper Florida Keys . Strong winds damaged billboards , awnings , commercial signs , several boats , planes , trees , and 1 @,@ 500 homes , with 300 of those becoming uninhabitable . Damage in that county was about $ 131 million . In Collier County , slight damage to houses occurred , with property losses reaching $ 30 million . Overall , Andrew caused 44 fatalities and $ 25 @.@ 3 billion in damage ( 1992 USD , $ 42 @.@ 7 billion 2016 USD ) in Florida alone , making it the costliest hurricane to hit the state . Some sources estimated that Andrew caused more than $ 32 billion in damage in the state ( 1992 USD , $ 54 billion 2016 USD ) . Of the 44 deaths , 15 were direct fatalities , while 29 were indirectly caused by the storm . It was later noted that had the storm been slightly larger or made landfall a few miles further north , it would have significantly affected Miami and Fort Lauderdale , which would have resulted in an even higher damage and death toll . An analysis by the American Meteorological Society indicated that unusual to most hurricanes , wind damage from Andrew was mostly north of the eyewall path and occurred primarily on the eastern edge of the storm .

 After hitting Florida , Andrew moved across the Gulf of Mexico and made landfall about 23 mi ( 37 km ) west @-@ southwest of Morgan City in south @-@ central Louisiana ; at landfall , the maximum sustained winds were 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) . As it moved ashore , the hurricane produced storm tides of at least 8 ft ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) , causing flooding along the coast from Vermilion Bay to Lake Borgne . River flooding was also reported , with the Tangipahoa River in Robert cresting at 3 @.@ 8 ft ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) above flood stage . Before making landfall , Andrew spawned an F3 tornado in Laplace , which killed two people and injuring 32 . The tornado was on the ground for about 10 minutes , during which it damaged or destroyed 163 structures , leaving 60 families homeless . Collectively , 14 tornadoes were reported in the parishes of Ascension , Iberville , Pointe <unk> , and Avoyelles , as well as in Baton Rouge . Heavy rains accompanied the storm 's passage through the state , peaking at 11 @.@ 02 in ( 280 mm ) in Robert . Elsewhere in the state , 9 fatalities and at least 75 injuries were reported . Offshore Louisiana , a group of six fishermen from Alabama perished due to drowning . 
 Along the Louisiana coastline , damage largely resembled that of a Category 2 hurricane . Damage was heaviest in St. Mary Parish , about 32 mi ( 51 km ) east of where Andrew made landfall . Hurricane @-@ force winds damaged roofs , although most homes fared well during the storm , with the main exception being large trees falling onto houses . In <unk> Point State Park , where winds were estimated at 90 mph ( 140 km / h ) , several mobile homes were destroyed . Houses in the Morgan City , Patterson , and Berwick areas suffered minor damage , mainly limited to shingles being torn off ; some large trees fell , causing severe damage to mobile homes . Similar damage was experienced further north in St. Mary Parish , in the towns of Franklin , Charenton , and <unk> , where mobile homes were toppled and debris from homes were scattered . At Port Fourchon , power lines were knocked down and a restaurant was unroofed , where winds were estimated to be between 80 and 85 mph ( 129 and 137 km / h ) . Damage was lighter in Jefferson Parish , where damage to mobile homes was reported and shingles were blown off , due to winds between 60 and 65 mph ( 97 and 105 km / h ) . The levee in the parish remained untouched . Across the state , the hurricane damaged 23 @,@ 000 homes and destroyed 985 homes and 1 @,@ 951 mobile homes ; private property damage was estimated at $ 1 billion . The high winds destroyed large areas of sugar and soybean crops , estimated at $ 289 million in damage . During the storm 's passage , upwelling occurred in the Atchafalaya Basin and Bayou Lafourche , killing 187 million freshwater fish . Damage to the fishing industry was estimated at $ 266 million . Overall , losses in the state of Louisiana reached approximately $ 1 @.@ 56 billion .

 While Andrew was entering the Gulf of Mexico , oil companies evacuated hundreds of employees from offshore drilling platforms . The storm damaged 240 oil and gas facilities off the coast of Louisiana . Overall , Hurricane Andrew caused about $ 500 million in damage to oil facilities . One company reported 13 platforms lost , 104 structures damaged , and five drilling wells blown off course . 
 As Andrew moved ashore in Louisiana , its outer fringes produced a storm tide of about 1 @.@ 3 ft ( 0 @.@ 40 m ) in Sabine Pass , Texas . Winds were minor in the state , reaching 30 mph ( 48 km / h ) in Port Arthur . After moving through Louisiana , Tropical Storm Andrew crossed Mississippi , prompting 3 severe thunderstorm warnings , 21 tornado warnings , and 16 flood warnings . Funnel clouds were observed near the path of the storm , along with 26 tornadoes . Structural damage was generally minimal , occurring from the tornadoes and severe thunderstorms . Strong winds knocked down trees in the southwestern portion of the state . The storm dropped rainfall across much of the state , peaking at 9 @.@ 30 in ( 236 mm ) at Sumrall . 
 In Alabama , rainfall caused flooding in low @-@ lying areas and creeks , covering a few county roads but not entering many houses or businesses . Along the coast , the storm produced flooding and high tides . Along Dauphin Island , high tides left severe beach erosion , with up to 30 ft ( 9 @.@ 1 m ) lost in some areas . Precipitation amounts in the state peaked at 4 @.@ 71 in ( 120 mm ) in <unk> . Two damaging tornadoes occurred in the state , and wind gusts of 41 mph ( 67 km / h ) were reported in Huntsville . Damage was generally minor in Alabama . 
 Tropical storm force wind gusts and damaging tornadoes extended eastward into Georgia . Monetary losses in the state reached about $ 100 @,@ 000 . Rainfall from Andrew spread across the southeastern United States along the Appalachian Mountains corridor ; totals of over 5 inches ( 125 mm ) were reported near the tri @-@ point border between Georgia , South Carolina , and North Carolina . Rainfall continued along the path of Andrew 's remnants through the Mid @-@ Atlantic and Ohio Valley , with precipitation measured as far north as Upstate New York .

 Initially , the Bahamas National Disaster Coordinator believed that foreign aid was not required . However , shortly after the storm , the Government of the United Kingdom began distributing blankets , food , ice , and water . The HMS Cardiff , a Royal Navy type 42 destroyer , was the operational guard ship at the time and assisted in relief operations in and around the <unk> area . In addition , assistance came from Canada , Japan , and the United States , as well as the United Nations . The American Red Cross delivered 100 tents , 100 rolls of plastic sheeting , and 1 @,@ 000 cots . In Florida , then @-@ President of the United States George H. W. Bush assessed damage in the Miami area with then @-@ Governor of Florida Lawton Chiles . Shortly thereafter , Bush declared the region a disaster area , which provided public assistance to victims of the storm in Broward , Collier , Miami @-@ Dade , and Monroe Counties . Then @-@ Lieutenant Governor of Florida Buddy MacKay flew over the impact area and described the scene as looking " like a war zone " . Governor Chiles considered asking the Florida State Legislature to raise taxes , stating that " No matter how much Congress appropriates to repair damage from Hurricane Andrew , the state will face a substantial cleanup bill " . In September 1992 , President Bush initially proposed a $ 7 @.@ 1 billion aid package to provide disaster benefits , small @-@ business loans , agricultural recovery , food stamps , and public housing for victims of Hurricane Andrew . After the United States House of Representatives appropriated aid to victims of Hurricane Iniki in Hawaii and Typhoon Omar in Guam , the cost was later increased to $ 11 @.@ 1 billion . The bill , which was the most costly disaster aid package at the time , was passed by Congress as House Resolution <unk> on September 18 , and signed into law by President Bush on September 23 . 
 Crime , especially looting and theft , rose sharply in the areas south of Miami immediately after Andrew . Reports indicate that merchandise was stolen at a number of damaged or destroyed shopping centers in southern Miami @-@ Dade County . Additionally , looting occurred in neighborhoods severely affected by the storm , regardless of the how few of the owners possessions remained . Initially , the slow response of federal aid prompted Dade County Emergency Management Director Kate Hale to famously exclaim at a nationally televised news conference , " Where in the hell is the cavalry on this one ? They keep saying we 're going to get supplies . For God 's sake , where are they ? " Almost immediately , President Bush promised , " Help is on the way , " and mobile kitchens , food , and tents , along with over 20 @,@ 000 units from the Florida Army National Guard ( 124th Infantry Regiment from Florida ) ; the 24th Infantry Division from Fort Wainwright , the 82nd Airborne Division in Fort Bragg , and the 10th Mountain Division from Fort Drum . In order to provide temporary housing for the homeless , military personnel set up six tent cities , five in Florida City and Homestead , with an additional one later opened at the Miccosukee Indian Reservation . 
 The storm struck Florida in the midst of 1992 presidential election campaign . A poll conducted by CBS News in September showed that 65 % of Miami @-@ Dade County residents approved of Bush 's handling of the disaster , while 61 % of approved statewide . Despite the support of Bush 's response and his proposal to rebuild Homestead Air Force Base , he benefited little politically and trailed 48 % <unk> % against Bill Clinton in another poll taken in September . Additionally , 75 % of voters in Miami @-@ Dade County and 82 % of Floridians overall stated that the president 's actions in response to Andrew would not impact their vote in November . Bush went on to carry the state of Florida , but by a margin of only 1 @.@ 89 % . 
 In the aftermath of the storm , extensive psychological effects were reported . Difficulty during clean @-@ up and recovery lead to increased divorce rates and a spike in Posttraumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) . The cases of PTSD primarily impacted children . A sampling of 378 adolescents by the University of South Carolina 's Department of Epidemiology and <unk> indicated that 3 % of males and 9 % of females met the criteria for PTSD . Dozens of children in the area attempted suicide , while counselors reported that between 50 and 60 children discussed killing themselves between December 1992 and January 1993 . 
 More than 930 @,@ 000 policyholders in South Florida lost coverage after 11 insurance companies went bankrupt , caused by more than 600 @,@ 000 insurance claims filed . This led the Florida Legislature to create new entities , such as the Joint Underwriting Association , the Florida <unk> Underwriting Association , and the Florida Hurricane Catastrophe Fund , in effort to restore adequate insurance capacity . Stricter building codes were created in Florida in the aftermath of Hurricane Andrew . In July 1996 , Governor Chiles established the Florida Building Codes Study Commission , with the purpose of assessing the buildings codes at the time , as well as enacting improvements and reform to the system . The commission study indicated that building codes and regulations were developed , amended , and administered by over 400 local jurisdictions and state agencies . 
 In 1998 , the Florida Building Code was established and put into effect by 2002 . It phased out local laws and regulations and replacing them with universal statewide building codes . After hurricanes Charley , Frances , Ivan , and Jeanne in 2004 , a study conducted by the University of Florida in the following year noted that " Homes built under the new Florida Building Code that became effective in 2002 sustained less damage on average than those built between 1994 and 2001 . " A report by the Florida Legislature in 2006 after Hurricanes Dennis , Katrina , and Wilma in 2005 came to a similar conclusion , indicating that " they added further evidence that the Florida Building Code is working . " 
 On August 26 , George H. W. Bush toured devastated areas of Louisiana with Governor Edwin Edwards . President Bush remarked , " The destruction from this storm goes beyond anything we have known in recent years , " but noted that damage was less severe than in Florida . After his visit to Louisiana , President Bush declared only Terrebonne Parish as a disaster area , but later included 34 other parishes under this declaration . 1 @,@ 300 National Guardsmen were deployed to southern Louisiana . In early September , officials announced that 1 @,@ 400 mobile homes , homes , and apartments would become available to residents whose dwellings became uninhabitable . H.R. <unk> also included disaster aid to the state of Louisiana .

 After the season had ended , the World Meteorological Organization 's RA IV Hurricane Committee retired the name Andrew from the Atlantic tropical cyclone naming lists and replaced it with Alex . The name Andrew will never again be used for an Atlantic hurricane . 
 = USS Enterprise vs Flambeau = 
 The USS Enterprise vs Flambeau was a single ship action fought in October 1800 during the Quasi @-@ War . During the action the USS Enterprise defeated the French privateer brig Flambeau off the leeward side of the island of Dominica in the Caribbean Sea . Although Enterprise was outgunned by Flambeau , she was still able to take her as a prize after a short battle . The battle helped bring to fame Enterprise 's commanding officer , Lieutenant John Shaw , who added the capture of Flambeau to his already long list of French prizes . 
 = = Background = = 
 During the Quasi @-@ War American merchant ships often became the target of French privateers who seized them in large quantities . In an effort to stem these depredations against American shipping several United States Navy warships were dispatched to hunt down French privateers . One such vessel was USS Enterprise , an American naval schooner under the command of Lieutenant John Shaw . Enterprise had been sent out to the Caribbean Sea in March 1800 with orders to cruise against French shipping in the region . Enterprise had already previously engaged and defeated several French privateers when on the night of 24 October she sighted the privateer Flambeau off the leeward side of Dominica . 
 The French letter of marque Flambeau was a brig that was slightly more powerful than Enterprise , having twelve eight @-@ pound cannon as compared to the American schooner 's dozen six @-@ pounders . The French privateer also had more crew than the American vessel , 110 opposed to Enterprise 's 83 . With a broadside of 48 pounds to Enterprise 's 36 pounds and with a larger crew , Flambeau had an advantage over Enterprise . Nonetheless , Shaw decided to engage Flambeau . Enterprise could not catch up to Flambeau but when morning came Flambeau found herself becalmed . Her captain then used sweeps to close with Enterprise . 
 = = Action = = 
 Eventually a wind came and the two ships managed to maneuver towards each other until they were within musket range . After engaging with small arms for a while , Lieutenant Shaw eventually veered his schooner away and Flambeau opened up on the Americans with a broadside of roundshot . Enterprise replied with her own broadside and the two vessels engaged each other with cannon for twenty minutes . Flambeau was beginning to receive heavy damage when her captain decided to disengage and maneuvered away from Enterprise . However , Enterprise pursued the French brig and continued to engage her . 
 Flambeau 's foretopmast was in danger of being dismasted from damage it had received from Enterprise , so the French captain sent men aloft to try to repair it . However after a sudden gust of wind the mast flew off the ship carrying six French sailors with it . Enterprise ceased her attacks upon Flambeau and sent out a boat to rescue the French sailors adrift on the topmast . After rescuing the French topmen , Enterprise caught up with the French brig and came alongside . Before the action could continue the French captain struck her colours as Flambeau 's medicine chest had been destroyed and the hull compromised multiple times . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The entire action lasted about forty minutes . The French were much worse off than the Americans in terms of casualties , with 7 Frenchmen killed and 33 wounded compared to 3 Americans killed and 7 wounded . A prize crew from Enterprise was sent aboard Flambeau and sailed her to Saint Kitts where she was condemned . The proceeds from the sale of Flambeau were adjudicated to the crew of Enterprise . 
 The capture of Flambeau brought further acclaim to Shaw , who had already defeated several other French privateers and taken them as prizes . Enterprise continued her cruise , next chasing down and capturing Pauline and later <unk> . Shortly afterward , chronic illness forced Shaw to transfer command of the vessel to Lieutenant Andrew Sterett . <unk> continued to cruise the Caribbean , taking several more prizes before returning home . Upon Shaw 's return home the president and other public officials personally thanked him for his service . Shaw later continued his naval career , serving with distinction during the War of 1812 .

 Interstate 37 ( I @-@ 37 ) is a 143 @.@ 0 @-@ mile ( 230 @.@ 1 km ) Interstate Highway located within the U.S. state of Texas . The highway was first designated in 1959 as a route between Corpus Christi and San Antonio . Construction in the urban areas of Corpus Christi and San Antonio began in the 1960s and the segments of the Interstate Highway in rural areas were completed by the 1980s . Prior to I @-@ 37 , the route between Corpus Christi and San Antonio was served by a combination of State Highway 9 ( SH 9 ) from Corpus Christi to Three Rivers and U.S. Route 281 ( US 281 ) from Three Rivers to San Antonio . As a result of the construction of I @-@ 37 , SH 9 was removed from the State Highway System . 
 The highway begins in Corpus Christi at US 181 and SH 35 and heads north to San Antonio , where it ends at I @-@ 35 . Beyond I @-@ 35 , the freeway continues as US 281 to northern San Antonio as a major freeway . In Corpus Christi , the highway provides access to the downtown area , the Port of Corpus Christi , and the Corpus Christi International Airport . In San Antonio , it provides access to Downtown , Brooks City @-@ Base , the Alamodome , the Tower of the Americas , the River Walk , the Alamo , and by extension via US 281 , the San Antonio International Airport . The route provides an important connection between I @-@ 35 and the Texas Gulf Coast as well as one of the few limited @-@ access hurricane evacuation routes away from the southern Texas coast . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Interstate 37 starts near the Gulf Coast in Corpus Christi and heads northwest toward San Antonio . It links South Texas to the northern parts of the state via I @-@ 69E , US 77 , and US 281 . The highway functions as one of the few freeway hurricane evacuation routes for the southern Texas coast . It roughly parallels US 181 , which both begins and ends at I @-@ 37 , and US 281 . 
 Unofficially , I @-@ 37 begins at an intersection with Shoreline Boulevard on the edge of Corpus Christi Bay . It then heads west as a surface street for three blocks where it becomes entrance and exit ramps which connect to the freeway . I @-@ 37 begins officially at the gore point for these ramps , which is part of an interchange complex that also represents the southern ends of US 181 and SH 35 . 
 It heads west from US 181 through Corpus Christi and intersects two freeways , SH 286 ( the Crosstown Expressway ) and SH 358 ( Padre Island Drive ) . The highway turns towards the northwest after the SH 358 interchange roughly parallel to the south of the Nueces River . Just prior to leaving the Corpus Christi city limits , it intersects and has a short concurrency with US 77 ( future I @-@ 69E ) . US 77 ( future I @-@ 69E ) merges with I @-@ 37 as a freeway from the south ; the two continue to the north and split after crossing the Nueces River . The Interstate continues to the northwest as US 77 ( future I @-@ 69E ) continues to the northeast . 
 I @-@ 37 transitions to a rural setting once outside of the Corpus Christi city limits on its way to Mathis and Lake Corpus Christi . It continues on to the northwest and intersects US 59 ( future I @-@ <unk> ) east of George West . It begins paralleling US 281 to the east before the two intersect and have a concurrency north of Three Rivers near Choke Canyon Reservoir . U.S. Highway 281 Alternate ( US 281 Alt ) splits off from I @-@ 37 near <unk> and parallels I @-@ 37 before rejoining north of Campbellton . The two routes remain concurrent until US 281 splits off to head to Pleasanton , while I @-@ 37 bypasses the city to the east . After US 281 leaves towards the northwest , I @-@ 37 turns to the north towards San Antonio . 
 As I @-@ 37 enters the San Antonio city limits , it intersects the northern terminus of US 181 . Continuing to the north , it intersects I @-@ 410 , the inner loop around San Antonio , at a stack interchange . At this junction , the Interstate once again runs concurrently with US 281 which had been concurrent with I @-@ 410 . Heading north through the south side of San Antonio , I @-@ 37 provides access to Brooks City @-@ Base ( formerly Brooks AFB ) . After a cloverleaf interchange at Loop 13 , the freeway turns towards the northwest . The highway intersects I @-@ 10 , which is concurrent with US 90 and US 87 , at a stack interchange on the southeastern corner of Downtown . After the interchange , it once again heads north on the east side of Downtown . It passes near the Alamodome , the Tower of the Americas , the River Walk and the Alamo . I @-@ 37 ends at the northeastern corner of Downtown at a junction with I @-@ 35 . US 281 continues to the north as a freeway and provides access to the San Antonio International Airport and later far north central Texas . 
 From I @-@ 410 to I @-@ 10 in San Antonio , I @-@ 37 is designated the Lucian Adams Freeway , after the World War II veteran . Adams is a native of Port Arthur , and received the Medal of Honor for his service in France , along with the Bronze Star and Purple Heart for his gallantry during the Cassino Campaign . From I @-@ 10 to its northern terminus at I @-@ 35 , it is designated the Staff Sergeant William J. <unk> Freeway . <unk> was the first San Antonio native to receive the Medal of Honor after being killed in action during World War II .

 Prior to I @-@ 37 , the routing between Corpus Christi and San Antonio was covered by SH 9 from Corpus Christi to Three Rivers and US 281 from Three Rivers to San Antonio . Beginning in 1971 , sections of SH 9 were officially removed from the State Highway System as I @-@ 37 was completed . No sections of US 281 were removed from the State Highway System as a result of the construction of I @-@ 37 , but the two do share the same alignment at two different points between San Antonio and Three Rivers . Also , US 281 was rerouted onto I @-@ 37 in San Antonio in 1978 . 
 I @-@ 37 was first designated in 1959 to provide a route between San Antonio and Corpus Christi . Construction began in the 1960s and the route was completed by the 1980s . The first sections of the freeway completed were in Corpus Christi . The freeway was completed from its southern terminus to 1 @.@ 2 miles ( 1 @.@ 9 km ) to the west at the Port Avenue overpass to include the SH 286 interchange in 1963 . In 1964 , the freeway was extended another 1 @.@ 1 miles ( 1 @.@ 8 km ) westward with the completion of the overpasses at Nueces Bay Boulevard and Buddy Lawrence Boulevard . By 1965 , the freeway had been extended west 1 @.@ 4 miles ( 2 @.@ 3 km ) to Navigation Boulevard . In 1966 , the interchange at SH 358 was complete , as were the <unk> to Corn Products Road , 1 @.@ 0 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) west of the SH 358 interchange . By 1968 , the freeway had been completed an additional 8 @.@ 1 miles ( 13 @.@ 0 km ) further west to <unk> Road . The southbound I @-@ 37 bridge over the Nueces River was built in 1933 for US 77 ( future I @-@ 69E ) when it was first routed through Corpus Christi . The northbound bridge was built in 1958 with the expansion of US 77 ( future I @-@ 69E ) to four lanes . 
 Construction in San Antonio also began in the 1960s and was completed in 1972 . The first sections were completed in 1967 to include the portion just south of I @-@ 410 at the US 181 interchange . The section from Steves Avenue north to Florida Street to include the I @-@ 10 interchange was also complete in 1967 . In 1968 , the section south of I @-@ 410 was extended south to Loop 1604 . In 1969 , the two sections were connected with the completion of overpasses at Goliad Road , Pecan Valley Drive , Fair Avenue and Hackberry Street as well as the completion of the interchanges at I @-@ 410 and Loop 13 . The last sections left were on the east side of downtown . The downtown overpasses at Durango Boulevard , Commerce Street and the overpass stretching from Houston Street to Jones Avenue were all completed in 1972 . The last portion completed in San Antonio was the stack interchange at I @-@ 35 ( also known as the San Antonio " Downtown Mixer " ) , near the Pearl Brewery . With the completion of the interchange in 1972 , the city had a complete freeway loop in conjunction with I @-@ 10 and I @-@ 35 around the central business district of the city . At the time construction began in July 1969 , the I @-@ 35 interchange was the largest highway construction project in state history at $ 11 million ( $ 65 million in 2007 ) . 
 The rural sections of the freeway were completed later than those in the urban areas . Construction of the highway in Corpus Christi and Nueces County continued north over the Nueces River into San <unk> County . The interchange at US 77 ( future I @-@ 69E ) was completed in 1969 . The road that was already in existence along this stretch , SH 9 , would be utilized as a frontage road as many of the bridges along this stretch were from when SH 9 was built in the 1930s . The main lanes were extended northward to SH 234 in 1969 . By 1970 , the freeway had been extended as far north as SH 188 . In 1971 , I @-@ 37 reached FM 888 and service to the city of Mathis . During the mid @-@ 1970s , the southern section and northern section were both being extended . The southern section was extended northward in Live Oak County to US 59 ( future I @-@ <unk> ) in 1975 and FM 799 in 1976 . The northern section saw completion in Atascosa County to FM 541 in 1975 and FM 1099 in 1976 . By the early 1980s , the freeway was nearly complete . In 1980 , the interchange at US 281 southeast of Pleasanton was complete . With the completion of the interchange at SH 72 and other bridges in the Pleasanton area in 1981 , I @-@ 37 was complete .

 Norman <unk> Biggs ( 3 November 1870 – 27 February 1908 ) was a Welsh international rugby union wing who played club rugby for Cardiff and county rugby for Glamorgan . Both Biggs and his brother Selwyn played international rugby for Wales , though they never played together in the same match for Wales . Biggs also played cricket for Glamorgan and in 1893 was part of a team that took on Cardiff in a two @-@ day match ; he faced his brother Selwyn , who was a member of the Cardiff team . 
 Biggs is notable for being a member of the 1893 Triple Crown winning Wales team , being the youngest capped player to represent the Wales international team , a record he held for over a century , and the unusual circumstances of his death by poison arrow . 
 = = Early history = = 
 Norman Biggs was born in Cardiff to John and Emily Biggs . His father , who lived at Park Place in the centre of the city , was a brewer by trade who owned businesses in Cardiff and Bristol . Biggs was privately educated at several proprietary schools including <unk> School in Weston @-@ super @-@ Mare , before matriculating to University College Cardiff and later Trinity Hall , Cambridge , playing rugby for both university teams . It was reported that Biggs should have won a sporting ' Blue ' while at Cambridge , but an injury to his ribs ruled him out . As well as playing rugby , Biggs was a keen sprinter and he was able to run 100 yards in even time , and was able to beat world sprint champion Charlton <unk> at this distance . On returning to Cardiff he joined his father 's brewing business . In 1887 , Biggs played his first senior game for Cardiff RFC , in a match against Penarth . Biggs came from a large sporting family and was one of six brothers to play rugby for Cardiff . His most notable brothers were Selwyn , who also played for Wales , and Cecil , who captained Cardiff during their 1904 / 05 season .

 Biggs gained his first cap for Wales when he was selected to play against the touring New Zealand Natives in 1888 at St. Helen 's Ground . At the time Biggs was 18 years and 49 days old , making him the youngest Wales international , a record that would last for more than a century before being broken by Tom <unk> in 2010 . The New Zealanders were the first touring team from the Southern Hemisphere and brought with them a reputation for over @-@ vigorous play . Biggs himself was described by the press as " palpably nervous " before the kick @-@ off , though many of the backs appeared withdrawn , apart from William <unk> and James Webb appearing calm . Not only did Biggs have the Māori opposition to contend with , the Swansea crowd were also hostile towards their own team , as they felt the Swansea backs should have been selected instead . Biggs , as an inexperienced new cap from rivals Cardiff , was picked out by the crowd as one of those players unworthy of his place and was heckled . Nonetheless , the Welsh team were victorious , with tries from Thomas , Towers and Hannan and a single conversion from Webb . A week later on 29 December , Biggs faced the same tourists , this time as part of the Cardiff team . Biggs had been disappointing in his international debut , but regained his form on the pitch at the Cardiff Arms Park . Within 90 seconds of the start of the match , Biggs scored a " sparkling try " . Biggs should have scored again , but dropped the ball after crossing the line in the slippery conditions . Cardiff won by a goal and a try to one try .

 Later in the 1888 – 89 season , Biggs was reselected for the Welsh team as part of the 1889 Home Nations Championship . He was not chosen for the first game of the season against Scotland , but was accepted for the second and final game to Ireland . Under the captaincy of Arthur Gould , Biggs was partnered on the wing by Abel Davies of London Welsh . Wales lost to Ireland by two tries to nil , the first time the Irish had won on Welsh soil . Biggs and Davies were both dropped for the next season . 
 It took Biggs until the 1892 Home Nations Championship to regain his place in the national team , again he was chosen for the final game of the tournament against Ireland . Although the Welsh backs contained the talents of Billy Bancroft , brothers Evan and David James and Arthur and Bert Gould , the Welsh team were outclassed by Victor Le Fanu 's Ireland . It was the first time Wales had lost all three games in the Championship . Despite the loss Biggs was reselected for all three games of the 1893 tournament , all under the captaincy of " Monkey " Gould . In a reversal of fortunes from the previous season , Wales managed to win all three matches , lifting the Triple Crown for the first time in the country 's history . Biggs played an important role during the Triple Crown winning season , scoring two tries , one each in the games against England and Scotland . The 1893 away game against Scotland is described as Biggs ' best international match and ' his speed and general play were the main factors in securing the first victory of the Principality over Scotland at Scotland ' . 
 Biggs played in two more internationals for Wales , both in the 1894 Championship and both resulted in losses . The first game of the 1894 Championship was against England , and Wales suffered a heavy defeat , losing 24 – 3 . In an after match interview Biggs was asked why he had failed to tackle Harry Bradshaw , who scored the first try ; Biggs responded " Tackle him ? It was as much as I could do to get out of his way ! " . In his final game against Ireland , Biggs was part of an all Cardiff three @-@ quarters , along with Tom Pearson , Dai Fitzgerald and Jack Elliott . The very next international saw Biggs ' younger brother Selwyn selected for the first time , the brothers missing each other by just one match .

 Biggs played for Cardiff from the 1886 – 87 season through to 1898 – 99 , though not continuously , spending some time in the early 1890s in London . He played in 166 matches for Cardiff , was one of the highest scoring players the club had produced . He scored five or more try conversions in a single match on seven occasions , six in the same season ( 1893 – 94 ) , against Gloucester , Bristol , London Welsh , Penygraig , Exeter and Cardiff & <unk> The 1893 – 94 season saw Biggs score 58 conversions , 25 tries and two dropped goals bringing his points tally to 199 points . This remained a club record until the 1972 – 73 season when it was surpassed by John Davies . Biggs ended his Cardiff career with 107 tries , four less than his brother Cecil . 
 Biggs played for several club teams throughout his career , including England 's Richmond and Welsh exile club London Welsh . On 24 December 1890 , Biggs played for London Welsh in a match against his longterm club Cardiff . The London Welsh team produced a ' devastating display ' to beat Cardiff by a single try . At county level he represented Glamorgan where he played alongside his brother , and later turned out for Somerset . During the 1893 / 94 season Biggs was made club captain of Cardiff , and in the same season he led Cardiff against the invitational team the Barbarians , not only winning the game but also scoring two tries and kicking a successful conversion . The same season as he faced the Barbarians with Cardiff , Biggs was invited to join the tourists ; one of four of the Biggs brothers to play for the team . The last notable club Biggs represented was Bath , captaining the senior team during the 1899 – 1900 season . 
 In 1894 Biggs was invited to play for the Barbarians , and on 2 April , he faced <unk> , playing alongside his brother Selwyn , who was also making his Barbarian 's debut . Biggs played twice more for the Barbarians , both matches against Bath Rugby . In the 1894 encounter Biggs converted a try in a 14 @-@ 0 victory , while the 1896 match saw Biggs score a try and two conversions in a 13 @-@ 13 draw .

 After the outbreak of the Second Boer War , Biggs volunteered for active service and was posted as a private to the Glamorgan Yeomanry , which formed 4 Company , 1st Battalion Imperial Yeomanry for service in South Africa . Biggs later reflected how life in the Yeomanry was a constant struggle , and he engaged in 57 skirmishes with his unit coming under daily sniper fire . He was wounded near Vrede on 11 October 1900 , when he was shot through the thigh whilst patrolling . He was returned to England on the hospital ship Simla which left Cape Town 26 November and arrived at Southampton on 18 December . He was then commissioned as a second lieutenant on 16 February 1901 . On 17 April he was promoted lieutenant and attached to 4th Battalion Imperial Yeomanry . Later in the year he either received a further wound , or fell ill , since The Times reported on 26 September that he had been discharged from hospital and returned to duty in the week ending 8 September . He returned home on the steamship <unk> , which left Cape Town on 19 July . He relinquished his commission on 12 September , and was granted the honorary rank of lieutenant , and permission to continue wearing his uniform . 
 Biggs was then commissioned as a lieutenant in the 3rd Battalion Welsh Regiment on 13 June 1903 . He was appointed an Instructor of Musketry on 10 May 1905 , He was then seconded to the Colonial Office and posted to Northern Nigeria as a superintendent of police in a military area on 10 February 1906 , by that time he had also been promoted captain .

 The 2010 Guatemala City sinkhole was a disaster in which an area approximately 65 ft ( 20 m ) across and 300 ft ( 90 m ) deep collapsed in Guatemala City 's Zona 2 , swallowing a three @-@ story factory . The sinkhole occurred for a combination of reasons , including Tropical Storm Agatha , the Pacaya Volcano eruption , and leakage from sewer pipes .

 Overall , the risk of sinkholes occurring in Guatemala City is high and unpredictable . One recent , similar sinkhole had collapsed in 2007 , forming a pit 100 metres deep . The 2007 Guatemala City sinkhole was formed by fluid from a sewer eroding <unk> volcanic ash , limestone , and other pyroclastic deposits underlying Guatemala City . The hazards around the pipe have since then been mitigated , by improved handling of the city 's wastewater and runoff . Several rainstorms also contributed to the sinkhole 's collapse , as stormwater percolated into the ground , further dissolving the rocks beneath Guatemala City . The 2010 sinkhole was formed for similar reasons .

 The sinkhole formed due to volcanic pumice deposits , upon which Guatemala City is built . These deposits were unconsolidated and of low density , allowing easy erosion . According to Sam Bonis , a geologist at Dartmouth College , leaking pipes went unfixed long enough to create the conditions necessary for sinkhole formation because of lax city zoning regulations and building codes . Bonis also says that the Guatemala City sinkhole is a misnomer : sinkholes have natural causes , but this one was mainly artificial . In addition , according to Bonis , sinkholes are usually formed from limestone but there is no limestone hundreds of metres underneath Guatemala City . Bonis proposes that the sinkhole be renamed a piping feature .

 Tropical Storm Agatha was first identified as a trough of low pressure of the western coast of Costa Rica on May 24 , 2010 . On May 29 , the depression intensified into a tropical storm and was given the name Agatha . Later that day , the system intensified slightly before making landfall near the Mexico @-@ Guatemala border with winds of 45 mph ( 75 km / h ) . By the morning of May 30 , the center of Agatha moved over the highest terrain in Central America , resulting in the dissipation of the low @-@ level circulation . Torrential rains from the storm widened the cavity , eventually causing the collapse of the sinkhole .

 On May 27 , three days before Agatha became a tropical depression , the Pacaya volcano , located about 25 mi ( 40 km ) south of Guatemala City , erupted , killing at least one person and blanketing nearby areas with layers of ash . The eruption prompted officials to shut down the country 's international airport . Upon the formation of Agatha , people feared that excessive rainfall from the storm could exacerbate the situation and trigger lahars . This had the effect of clogging the underground pipes with soot , increasing the chances of pipe rupture .
