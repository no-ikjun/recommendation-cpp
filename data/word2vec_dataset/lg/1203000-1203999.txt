 Following Michigan 's season @-@ ending loss in the 2011 Gator Bowl , head coach Rich Rodriguez was fired and replaced by Brady Hoke . As Robinson had thrived in Rodriguez 's spread offense , the coaching change led to speculation that Robinson may transfer . On January 17 , 2011 , Robinson ended the speculation when he issued a statement confirming that he would stay at Michigan . In the video statement released by the University of Michigan , Robinson said he seriously considered transferring and noted that Rodriguez was one of the few coaches willing to give him the chance to play quarterback at the next level . Robinson explained his decision to stay at Michigan : " This is my family . This is my home now . ... I couldn 't let it go . " He also noted that he talked to his teammates and told them , " ' You know , I can 't just leave you out there . ' I 've been around these guys two years and we 've bonded and it 's like a family here . There 's nothing like this . "

 After his final season at Michigan , Robinson stated that he was open to playing any position in the National Football League . Some suggested that he would have a better chance of being drafted by an NFL team if he switched to cornerback , receiver , running back or kick returner because of his quickness – 4 @.@ 35 in the 40 yard dash . CBS Sports ' Mike Freeman said his talents would be wasted on the defensive side of the ball . Doug Flutie ( Buffalo Bills ) and Dieter Brock ( Los Angeles Rams ) were relatively successful quarterbacks similar in stature to Robinson . Russell Wilson who currently plays starting quarterback for the Seattle Seahawks is also similar in stature to Robinson . 
 Robinson participated in the 2013 Senior Bowl at wide receiver . In the game , Robinson caught two passes for 21 yards and rushed the ball once for a three @-@ yard loss . His performance in the game and the preceding week of practice was regarded as unimpressive and his draft stock fell to the late rounds . 
 Robinson was the only Wolverine from the 2012 – 2013 team who was invited to participate in the NFL combine . He was not invited as a quarterback , but rather as a wide receiver , but he did intend to throw and return kickoffs and punts on his Pro Day . On the Pro Day , he did not do quarterback drills , but he did return punts , made catches while running routes , and also did running back drills . Scouts concluded he should become a running back first before developing into a wideout .

During this time , the contest had gone through several rounds of voting , until finally being shrunken down to the final two , where Robinson faced off against Texas A & M wide receiver Ryan Swope . Robinson lasted through all voting rounds , and outlasted Alabama Crimson Tide running back Eddie Lacy , and possible National Football League 1st round draft selections Jarvis Jones of the Georgia Bulldogs and standout Tight End Tyler <unk> of the Notre Dame Fighting Irish . The contest gained attention worldwide , with former students and athletes vouching support for their former schools .

 In the episode , Christmas time at the office leads to depression for Michael , when his girlfriend Carol ( Steve Carell 's wife , Nancy Walls ) breaks up with him . Michael , Andy , Dwight , and Jim then go to a local Benihana restaurant , where Michael and Andy find dates with two of the restaurant 's waitresses . Back at the office , after a conflict with a bossy Angela , Karen and Pam decide to create their own Christmas party . When the majority of the office decide to go to Karen and Pam 's party , Angela becomes upset , and seeing this , Karen and Pam decide to combine the parties . Soon after , Michael and Andy 's dates leave them , but Michael nevertheless finds someone to go to Jamaica with him . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 Carol Stills ( Nancy Walls ) confronts Michael Scott ( Steve Carell ) about the Christmas card he sent her , in which he superimposed his head on the body of Carol 's former husband in a family photo . She breaks off the relationship , leaving Michael heartbroken and stuck with a pair of tickets to Jamaica . For the past several months , Pam Beesly ( Jenna Fischer ) has led Dwight Schrute ( Rainn Wilson ) to believe that he is being recruited by the CIA , and her gift to Jim Halpert ( John Krasinski ) is that he can choose Dwight 's first assignment . Jim declines the gift and claims that as the new office " Number Two " he shouldn 't be engaging in such activities , leaving Pam discouraged by a changed Jim . 
 Andy Bernard ( Ed Helms ) takes Michael to Benihana ( an " Asian Hooters " according to Michael ) to help him forget his recent troubles ; Michael drags Dwight and Jim along . The group stumbles upon an <unk> couple ( Anne <unk> / Stephen Saux ) at the table and Dwight fails when attempting to impress the chef with his knowledge of Japanese knives . Andy successfully isolates Dwight from the rest of the party and convinces Michael to ask out their waitress , Cindy ( Brittany Ishibashi ) . Meanwhile , Jim plays pranks on Dwight and realizes that his excuse for declining Pam 's gift doesn 't hold water . 
 Angela Martin ( Angela Kinsey ) kicks Karen Filippelli ( Rashida Jones ) off the Party Planning Committee . In response , Pam reaches out to Karen , and the two plan a rival party . The rival Christmas parties begin , and the office staff members are forced to choose sides . Pam and Karen 's party is a hit , while Angela 's is a dreary affair . Michael and Andy each return with a waitress as their " new girlfriend " ( though neither is the one who waited on them at the restaurant ) . Angela accepts Pam 's offer to merge the parties . Oscar enters the office with his partner Gil just as Angela is singing The Little Drummer Boy , pauses for a moment , says , " Too soon " and leaves . 
 Meanwhile , Michael is unable to tell the two waitresses apart . To remedy this , he surreptitiously marks his date 's arm with a Sharpie . When he offers to take her to Jamaica , she declines and says that she has to attend school , and the two waitresses leave the party because it " blows " . 
 Jim consoles Michael by explaining that he just had a " rebound " relationship . Jim mentions that they 're fun for a while , but then you keep on thinking about the girl that broke your heart , implying he still thinks about Pam ( the girl who " broke his heart " ) . From his office , Michael makes a phone call and asks an unknown person to go to Jamaica with him . The offer is accepted . Pam is crushed when she sees Jim and Karen exchange gifts . Jim is crushed when he sees Roy give a gift to Pam . 
 At the end of the day , Jim tells Pam that a helicopter will be arriving to take Dwight to a welcoming party at CIA headquarters in Langley , Virginia . As Dwight waits on the roof , he receives the text message : " You have been compromised . Abort mission . Destroy phone . " Dwight throws his phone off the roof and walks away .

 " A Benihana Christmas " was directed by Harold Ramis and written by Jennifer Celotta . It was produced by Stephen Merchant , Ricky Gervais , Greg Daniels , Howard Klein , and Ben Silverman . The episode was shot in a real Benihana restaurant . According to the show 's prop master , different actresses were used because Andy and Michael failed to pick up the original waitresses , and settled for " less attractive ones " . At Paley Fest 2007 , Greg Daniels admitted that the joke failed due to poor casting . The waitresses that come to the office were supposed to be unattractive . Daniels stated that the actresses they hired for the role were " too good @-@ looking " . During filming , John Krasinski threw a shrimp across the table at Rainn Wilson . It bounced off Dwight 's glasses and landed in the glass of water he was about to drink . The producers chose not to use the footage because it looked so improbable as to be unbelievable .

 = Cöln @-@ class cruiser = 
 The Cöln class of light cruisers was Germany 's last class commissioned before her defeat in World War I. Originally planned to comprise ten ships , only two were completed ; Cöln and Dresden . Five more were launched , but not completed : Wiesbaden , Magdeburg , Leipzig , Rostock and Frauenlob , while another three were laid down but not launched : Ersatz Cöln , Ersatz Emden and Ersatz Karlsruhe ( for the last three , the names quoted were only provisional titles to be used during construction , and the three would have received other names at their launch if that had taken place ) . The design was a slightly modified version of the preceding Königsberg class . 
 Cöln and Dresden joined the High Seas Fleet in 1918 , which limited their service careers . They were assigned to the II Scouting Group , and participated in an abortive fleet operation to Norway to attack British convoys . They were to have led attacks on British merchant traffic designed to lure out the British Grand Fleet and force a climactic fleet battle in the final days of the war , but the Wilhelmshaven Mutiny forced the cancellation of the plan . The two ships were interned and eventually scuttled in Scapa Flow in June 1919 . Both Dresden and Cöln remain on the bottom of Scapa Flow . 
 = = Design = = 
 By 1916 , thirteen German light cruisers had been lost in the course of World War I. To replace them , the Kaiserliche Marine ordered ten new cruisers built to a modified Königsberg class design . All ten ships were laid down in 1915 and 1916 . Cöln was built by the Blohm & Voss shipyard in Bremen . Wiesbaden and Rostock were built at AG Vulcan in Stettin , and Leipzig , Ersatz Cöln , and Ersatz Emden were ordered from the AG Weser dockyard in Bremen . Dresden and Magdeburg were built at the Howaldtswerke shipyard in Kiel , while Frauenlob and Ersatz Karlsruhe were built by the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel . 
 Cöln and Dresden , the only two ships to be completed , were launched on 5 October 1916 and 25 April 1917 , respectively . Wiesbaden was launched on 3 March 1917 and was five months away from completion when she was canceled in December 1918 . Magdeburg followed on 17 November 1917 ; she was nine months from being finished when she was canceled . Leipzig was launched on 28 January 1918 and canceled seven months from completion . Rostock followed on 6 April , and also was seven months away from being finished . Frauenlob , the last ship of the class to be launched , on 16 September , was about thirteen months away from completion when she was canceled . The last three ships were canceled while still on the slipway .

 After their commissioning , Cöln and Dresden joined the High Seas Fleet . They were assigned to the II Scouting Group , alongside the cruisers Königsberg , Pillau , Graudenz , Nürnberg , and Karlsruhe . The ships were in service in time for the major fleet operation to Norway in 23 – 24 April 1918 . The I Scouting Group and II Scouting Group , along with the Second Torpedo @-@ Boat Flotilla were to attack a heavily guarded British convoy to Norway , with the rest of the High Seas Fleet steaming in support . The Germans failed to locate the convoy , which had in fact sailed the day before the fleet left port . As a result , Admiral Reinhard Scheer broke off the operation and returned to port . 
 In October 1918 , the two ships and the rest of the II Scouting Group were to lead a final attack on the British navy . Cöln , Dresden , Pillau , and Königsberg were to attack merchant shipping in the Thames estuary while the rest of the Group were to bombard targets in Flanders , to draw out the British Grand Fleet . Großadmiral Reinhard Scheer , the commander in chief of the fleet , intended to inflict as much damage as possible on the British navy , in order to secure a better bargaining position for Germany , whatever the cost to the fleet . On the morning of 29 October 1918 , the order was given to sail from Wilhelmshaven the following day . Starting on the night of 29 October , sailors on Thüringen and then on several other battleships mutinied . 
 During the sailors ' revolt , the crew of the battleship Markgraf refused to move out of Dresden 's way ; she aimed one of her 30 @.@ 5 cm ( 12 @.@ 0 in ) gun turrets at Dresden , but then backed down and let Dresden leave the port . The ship then went to Swinemünde , where she was partially scuttled and subsequently re @-@ floated and returned to seaworthy condition . The unrest ultimately forced Hipper and Scheer to cancel the operation . When informed of the situation , the Kaiser stated , " I no longer have a navy . " Following the capitulation of Germany in November 1918 , most of the High Seas Fleet 's ships , under the command of Rear Admiral Ludwig von Reuter , were interned in the British naval base in Scapa Flow . Cöln and Dresden were among the ships interned . 
 The fleet remained in captivity during the negotiations that ultimately produced the Versailles Treaty . Von Reuter believed that the British intended to seize the German ships on 21 June 1919 , which was the deadline for Germany to have signed the peace treaty . Unaware that the deadline had been extended to the 23rd , Reuter ordered the ships to be sunk at the next opportunity . On the morning of 21 June , the British fleet left Scapa Flow to conduct training maneuvers , and at 11 : 20 Reuter transmitted the order to his ships . Cöln sank at 13 : 50 and was never raised for scrapping . Dresden also remains at the bottom of Scapa Flow . 
 The eight ships that were not completed by the end of the war were formally stricken from the naval register on 17 November 1919 . Wiesbaden was broken up for scrap in 1920 after she was briefly considered for completion . Magdeburg was sold on 28 October 1921 for 1 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 marks and broken up the next year at Kiel @-@ Nordmole . Leipzig and Rostock were sold in 1921 and scrapped in Hamburg . Frauenlob was towed to the Deutsche Werke shipyard in 1921 and broken up . Ersatz Karlsruhe was dismantled on the slipway in 1920 , and Ersatz Cöln and Ersatz Emden were sold for 400 @,@ 000 marks apiece on 21 and 25 June 1921 , respectively . They were scrapped that year in Hamburg . 
 = American Arts Commemorative Series medallions = 
 American Arts Commemorative Series medallions are a series of ten gold bullion medallions that were produced by the United States Mint from 1980 to 1984 . They were sold to compete with the South African Krugerrand and other bullion coins . 
 The series was proposed by North Carolina senator Jesse Helms after the United States Department of the Treasury began selling portions of the national stockpile of gold . Iowa Representative Jim Leach suggested that the medallions depict notable American artists . President Jimmy Carter signed the bill containing the authorizing legislation into law on November 10 , 1978 , despite objections from Treasury officials . 
 The medallions were initially sold through mail order ; purchasers were required to obtain the day 's price by telephone before ordering . Later , the Mint sold them through telemarketing . Mintage ceased after the ten different medallions approved by Congress were produced . All were struck at the West Point Bullion Depository . The series sold poorly , prompting critics to blame the involved process by which they were first marketed , and the fact that they were medallions rather than coins . 
 = = Background = = 
 On April 19 , 1978 , the United States Treasury Department announced that a portion of the national gold stockpile was to be auctioned through the General Services Administration ( GSA ) beginning on May 23 , 1978 , in the form of 400 troy ounces ( 12 kg ) bars . According to the Treasury , the sales were intended to " [ reduce ] the U.S. trade deficit , either by increasing the exports of gold or by reducing the imports of this commodity " , and to " further the U.S. desire to continue progress toward the elimination of the international monetary role of gold . " For reasons of bookkeeping , an entire bar was set as the minimum purchase , which placed the gold outside of the reach of most Americans . North Carolina senator Jesse Helms was critical of the plan , saying that he was " opposed to the sale of U.S. gold to foreign and international banks and gold dealers " and that medallions should be " produced in small size , suitable for sale to average citizens . " On the day of the Treasury announcement , Helms introduced the Gold Medallion Act of 1978 . The stated intent was to provide average consumers with affordable , small @-@ sized gold bullion to compete with the South African Krugerrand and other world bullion coins , which were becoming increasingly popular with American investors . 1 @.@ 6 million troy ounces ( 50 @,@ 000 kg ) ounces of gold had been imported into the United States in the form of Krugerrands in 1977 alone . In a hearing on August 25 , 1978 , before the United States Senate Committee on Banking , Housing , and Urban Affairs , Helms said : 
 In the first year after enactment the bill would require that the first 1 @.@ 5 million ounces of gold sold be made into medallions . Under the stepped @-@ up rate of gold sales , that is only two months worth of gold . The amount is about equal to last year 's importation of foreign bullion coins , mostly Krugerrands from South Africa . 
 Helms went on to describe the characteristics of the proposed medallions , stating : 
 The one @-@ ounce medallion would have on one side the head of the statue of Freedom atop the Capitol , and it would be marked with the words , " One ounce fine gold , " and the word " freedom . " The reverse of the piece would be the Great Seal of the United States and the words " United States of America , " and the year in which it was produced . The half @-@ ounce medallion would have on one side some representation of the rights of individuals and the words " Human Rights , " and " One @-@ half ounce fine gold . " The reverse would be similar to the back side of the " Freedom " medallion , with the Great Seal . 
 Support for the medallions grew in Congress , prompting the <unk> of more legislation . Iowa representative Jim Leach proposed that the series feature designs honoring American artists . During the Committee on Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs hearing , Leach outlined the reasons for his proposal . He noted that the House Subcommittee on Historic Preservation received many suggestions of individuals worthy to appear on the dollar coin that had previously been proposed . Leach felt that a dollar coin was not a suitable way to commemorate the individuals , as it was impossible to honor such a large group on a coin whose design was likely to remain unchanged for a long period of time . He also noted that all United States coinage until then had depicted individuals whose principal contributions had been in government and politics rather than the arts . Leach described the specifics of his proposal , stating : 
 I am suggesting in H.R. 13567 that we honor 10 individuals who have been distinguished contributors to the arts — music , painting , writing , architecture and the theatre . Other fields might well be chosen , or other people than I have selected within the field of arts ; but the point I want to emphasize is this : while our coinage is and should be devoted to honoring those who have contributed to our political heritage , medals offer us an opportunity to honor those who have contributed to our cultural development , our economic achievements , our technological expertise , and other accomplishments which reflect the wide dimensions of our democratic society . 
 The subjects designated were painter Grant Wood , contralto singer Marian Anderson , authors Mark Twain and Willa Cather , musician Louis Armstrong , architect Frank Lloyd Wright , poet Robert Frost , sculptor Alexander Calder , actress Helen Hayes and author John Steinbeck . 
 Though the program received widespread support in Congress , Treasury officials opposed it . In a letter , Treasury secretary W. Michael Blumenthal wrote , " I do not believe the U.S. Government should permit the erroneous impression to be created that it cannot or will not take the necessary steps to combat inflation and that the public therefore needs to buy gold as a hedge against inflation . " Blumenthal also believed that if the government were to sanction the striking of gold medallions , the public would believe that the Treasury was actively encouraging investment in gold . Despite these objections , the bill was attached to the bank omnibus bill , which President Jimmy Carter signed into law on November 10 , 1978 . 
 = = Production and sale = = 
 The Treasury lacked money to put the medallions into production , so an appropriations bill was passed giving the department the necessary funding . The GSA was tasked with determining how best to market the new issues . The GSA proposed several sales plans , including the distribution of the medallions to a network of banks for sale to the public . This was rejected in favor of requiring purchasers to make a telephone call to learn the price of the medallions on the day of purchase , after which the purchaser was to go to a post office the same day to make payment . According to the legislation , the issues were to be " sold to the general public at a competitive price equal to the free market value of the gold contained therein plus the cost of manufacture , including labor , materials , dies , use of machinery , and overhead expenses including marketing costs . " 
 Production began in 1980 . Struck at the West Point Bullion Depository , the medallions contained 90 % gold , and were issued in two sizes : one containing one troy ounce ( 31 g ) of gold and one containing one half @-@ ounce ( 16 g ) of the metal . The first struck were those honoring Grant Wood on the one ounce medallion and Marian Anderson on the half @-@ ounce piece . Both were designed by United States Mint Chief Engraver Frank Gasparro . Sales were poor , and in September 1980 , the Mint announced that a private firm , commodity traders J. Aron and Company , would market the medallions . The new plan involved selling the medallions through a network of bullion dealers , banks , brokerage houses and coin dealers , a system similar to that South Africa used to distribute the Krugerrand in the US . In 1981 , the second year of production , the composition of the medallions was changed ; although the 90 % gold purity was retained , the balance was altered to include silver , which was added to change their appearance . That year 's medallions depicted Mark Twain and Willa Cather . These were designed by Matthew <unk> and <unk> Winter , respectively . These first four medallions bore no notation of their metallic content or country of origin . This was done to distinguish them from federal coinage . Beginning in 1982 , this information and small , toothlike designs , known as " denticles " , were added along the inner rim of the medallions , and reeding was added to the edge . That year 's issues depicted Louis Armstrong , as designed by John Mercanti , and Frank Lloyd Wright , designed by Edgar Steever . The following year 's medallions depicted Robert Frost and Alexander Calder . The former was designed by P. Fowler , while the latter was by Michael Iacocca . The final year of production saw the mintage of medallions with designs by John Mercanti honoring Helen Hayes and John Steinbeck . The Mint terminated the contract with J. Aron and Company in 1984 , opting instead to sell the medallions through a telemarketing program . In 1985 , Mint director Donna Pope announced that the medallions would be sold in another telemarketing operation in sets of five of either one each of the one ounce medallions or one each of the half @-@ ounce pieces , beginning in September of that year and ending on December 31 , or sooner if all sets sold .

 In October 1980 , Luis Vigdor , assistant vice @-@ president for bullion and numismatic operations of <unk> , <unk> & Brookes , then one of the largest coin firms in the country , compared the medallions and the efforts to market them unfavorably to the South African Krugerrand . According to Vigdor , they were difficult to market due to their lack of notation of weight , fineness and country of origin . He also criticized the marketing , asserting that people were unlikely to buy gold at the post office , and that the medallions were advertised poorly . Vigdor contrasted the medallions ' marketing program with the widespread success of the Krugerrand and the vigorous attempts to market them around the world . Commenting on the poor sale of the medallions , assistant director of marketing for the Mint Francis Frere said in 1984 : " it just hasn 't worked . They 're not selling . We 've made a strong effort , but it 's not working . " 
 On February 12 , 1982 , following the poor sales of the medallions , the United States Gold Commission recommended the minting of a gold coin . Donald Regan , Secretary of the Treasury and chairman of the commission , later told reporters that a gold coin could be easier to sell than medallions , because the suggested coins " could be redeemable in dollars " . The Mint issued gold coins for the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles and for the centennial of the Statue of Liberty in 1986 . Both issues were successful , and the Liberty piece sold out on advance sales . As the public was receptive to the gold coins , and President Ronald Reagan had banned the importation of Krugerrands in 1985 over South Africa 's apartheid policy , Congress authorized the American Gold Eagle gold bullion coin , which entered production as legal tender in 1986 .

 = LGBT themes in comics = 
 LGBT themes in comics are a relatively new concept , as lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ( LGBT ) themes and characters were historically omitted intentionally from the content of comic books and their comic strip predecessors , due to either censorship or the perception that comics were for children . With any mention of homosexuality in mainstream United States comics forbidden by the Comics Code Authority ( CCA ) until 1989 , earlier attempts at exploring these issues in the US took the form of subtle hints or subtext regarding a character 's sexual orientation . LGBT themes were tackled earlier in underground comix from the early 1970s onward . Independently published one @-@ off comic books and series , often produced by gay creators and featuring autobiographical storylines , tackled political issues of interest to LGBT readers . 
 Since the 1990s LGBT themes have become more common in mainstream US comics , including in a number of titles in which a gay character is the star . European comics have been more inclusive from an earlier date . The lack of censorship , and greater acceptance of comics as a medium of adult entertainment led to less controversy about the representation of LGBT characters . The popular Japanese manga tradition has included genres of girls ' comics that feature homosexual relationships since the 1970s , in the form of yaoi and yuri . These works are often extremely romantic and idealized , and include archetypal characters that often do not identify as gay or lesbian . Since the Japanese " gay boom " of the 1990s , a body of manga by queer creators aimed at LGBT customers has been established , including both bara manga for gay men and yuri aimed at lesbians , which often have more realistic and autobiographical themes . Pornographic manga also often includes sexualised depictions of lesbians and intersex people . Queer theorists have noted that LGBT characters in mainstream comic books are usually shown as assimilated into heterosexual society , whereas in alternative comics the diversity and uniqueness of LGBT culture is emphasized . 
 Comic strips have also dealt in subtext and innuendo , their wide distribution in newspapers limiting their inclusion of controversial material . The first openly gay characters appeared in prominent strips in the late 1970s ; representation of LGBT issues in these titles causes vociferous reaction , both praise and condemnation , to the present day . Comic strips aimed at LGBT audiences are also syndicated in <unk> and lesbian @-@ targeted magazines and comics have been created to educate people about LGBT @-@ related issues and to influence real @-@ world politics , with their format and distribution allowing them to transmit messages more subtle , complex , and positive than typical education material . Portrayal of LGBT themes in comics is recognized by several notable awards , including the Gaylactic Spectrum Awards and GLAAD Media Awards for outstanding comic book and comic strip . 
 = = Comic strips = = 
 Early comic strips also avoided overt treatment of gay issues , though examples of homosexual subtext have been identified . The 1938 – 1939 edition of Milton Caniff 's Terry and the Pirates features a primary villain , Sanjak , who has been interpreted by some as a lesbian with designs on the hero 's girlfriend . 
 The first widely distributed comic strip to tackle LGBT themes and include a gay character was Garry Trudeau 's Doonesbury . The strip introduced the character Andy Lippincott in 1976 , and his diagnosis with HIV in 1989 and AIDS related death in 1990 was the first representation of this issue in comic strips . This storyline led to a Pulitzer Prize nomination for Trudeau , but three newspapers of the 900 carrying the strip refused to publish it as being in bad taste . Two years later , the long @-@ standing character Mark Slackmeyer was revealed to be gay , continuing a reputation for controversial content . Slackmeyer , a liberal , continues to feature in the strip , with focus on his relationship with his politically conservative partner , Chase , including their marriage in 1999 and separation in 2007 . 
 The 11 July 1984 installment of Bloom County had the strip 's main characters staying at Bob & Ernie ’ s Castro Street Hotel , run by a gay S & M couple . 
 When Lynn Johnston 's For Better or For Worse explored the coming out of a teenaged character in 1993 , it provoked a vigorous reaction from conservative groups . Readers opposed to homosexuality threatened to cancel newspaper subscriptions , and Johnston received hate mail and death threats towards herself and her family . Over 100 newspapers ran replacement strips or canceled the comic . One result of the storyline was that Johnston was made a jury @-@ selected " nominated finalist " for the Pulitzer Prize for Editorial Cartooning in 1994 . The Pulitzer board said the strip " sensitively depicted a youth 's disclosure of his homosexuality and its effect on his family and friends . " Subsequent appearances of the character have not focused on his sexuality , and the creator has said that this will continue . 
 In most widely circulated strips , LGBT characters remained as supporting figures into the 21st century , with some , including <unk> and The Boondocks , featuring occasional appearances by gay characters . The conservative strip Mallard Fillmore occasionally approached gay issues from a critical perspective ; these storylines have been described as " insulting " to LGBT people . Many openly gay and lesbian comic creators self @-@ publish their work online as webcomics , giving them greater editorial freedom , and some of the strips are printed in collections . One example is Greg Fox 's Kyle 's Bed & Breakfast , a series focusing on a group of gay friends who live together and face realistic problems associated with their sexualities , including relationship troubles and being closeted . 
 Since the late 1980s specifically gay publications have also included comic strips , in which LGBT themes are ubiquitous . Local LGBT newspapers sometimes carry their own strips , like Ron Williams 's Quarter Scenes in the New Orleans paper Impact . Strips including Wendel by Howard Cruse , and Leonard and Larry by Tim Barela , have been syndicated in national gay magazines like the Advocate . 
 One of the best known and longest @-@ running LGBT comic strips , Dykes to Watch Out For , was written by Alison Bechdel – dubbed the " elder <unk> of LGBT comics " – from 1983 to 2008 . Dykes to Watch Out For is known for its social and political commentary and depictions of characters from all walks of life . Bechdel 's 2006 graphic memoir Fun Home : A Family <unk> was lauded by many media outlets as among the best books of the year . 
 Other noted LGBT @-@ themed comic strips have included Doc and Raider , The Chosen Family , Chelsea Boys and The Mostly <unk> Social Life of Ethan Green . Ethan Green has also been adapted into a live @-@ action feature film . 
 = = Underground and alternative comics = = 
 LGBT themes were found first in underground or alternative comics , often published by small independent presses or self @-@ published . Such comics frequently advocated political positions and included depictions of sex , usually not intended solely to cause arousal but included as part of the exploration of themes including gender and sexuality . 
 “ Captain <unk> and His Pervert Pirates ” by S. Clay Wilson in “ Zap ” # 3 ( 1968 ) featured explicit sexual homosexual acts and was instrumental in making other underground cartoonists approach taboo subjects . However , gay characters rarely featured in underground comics from 1968 to 1975 , and when they did they were usually lisping caricatures and comic transvestites . An instalment of “ Harold <unk> ” by Rand Holmes in 1971 stands out for attacking the homophobia of Dr Reuben ’ s sex manual Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Sex * ( * But Were Afraid to Ask ) , featuring explicit mutual gay sex acts , and promoting Gay Lib . 
 Eventually comics appeared aimed at a gay audience : the first documented example of a widely circulated underground gay comic was Gay Heart Throbs , which produced several issues in the mid @-@ 1970s , but struggled to find an audience . 
 Notable publications included Gay Comix , which was created in 1980 by Howard Cruse , featured the work of gay , lesbian , and transsexual artists , and had close ties with the gay liberation movement . Much of the early content was autobiographical , but more diverse themes were explored in later editions . Autobiographical themes included falling in love , coming out , repression , and sex . Gay Comix also served as a source for information about non @-@ mainstream LGBT @-@ themed comics and events . Artists producing work for Gay Comix included Mary Wings , creator of the first one @-@ off lesbian book Come Out Comix ( 1972 ) and Dyke Shorts ( 1976 ) , and Roberta Gregory , who created Dynamite Damsels ( 1976 ) the first lesbian underground serial comic book and the character Bitchy Bitch . <unk> 's Comix also tackled issues of homosexuality on a regular basis , and the first issue was also the venue for the first ever comic strip featuring an out lesbian , called " Sandy Comes Out " , by Trina Robbins . Excerpts from Gay Comix are included in the 1989 anthology Gay Comics , one of the earliest histories of the subject . 
 Meatmen : An Anthology of Gay Male Comics and its sequels collect works by a range of artists and cartoonists . The work of " every gay cartoonist of note " has appeared in the series , including works by Howard Cruse , Jeff Krell , Brad Parker , John Blackburn , Jon Macy , and the stylized pornography of Tom of Finland . The contents of Meatmen are generally more explicit and lewd than the more mainstream oriented Gay Comics . Tom of Finland was a prolific fetish artist , specializing in images of men with exaggerated primary and secondary sex traits , such as extreme muscularity and improbably large penises . His drawings frequently feature two or more men either immediately preceding or during explicit sexual activity . Howard Cruse has been described as " the most important gay cartoonist " , and his work explores both pop and gay culture . His LGBT @-@ themed work is often adults @-@ only , and in addition to being featured in Meatmen and Gay Comics , has been syndicated in publications such as Heavy Metal , RAW , and Village Voice . 
 Creators have used the comics medium to educate readers about LGBT @-@ related issues including safe sex , examples being Strip AIDS U.S.A ; and to influence real @-@ world politics , as with the British comics book <unk> ( Artists Against Rampant Government Homophobia ) , produced by British , American , and Canadian artists in response to a law that would make " promoting homosexuality " illegal by the British government . The comic book format and humour has been described as giving such works a more positive message than typical education material . Comic strip style educational material about AIDS dates back to a chart in the French magazine Liberation from 1986 , which used simple figures to explain unsafe practices . Fiction comics produced specifically to foster AIDS prevention include the widely distributed French @-@ language La Sida ( 1995 ) , created by the Institut Alfred <unk> as part of its " Prevention Sourire " series . La Sida was aimed at a young audience and used humour to de @-@ dramatise the subject , with HIV status indicated a metaphorical " little green monster " . <unk> , a graphic novel by Latin American writer Jaime Cortez , is based on transgender HIV activist and educator Adela Vazquez . Published through AIDS Project Los Angeles , the novel is narrated in English and Spanish while commenting on themes of gender identity , sexual experiences and HIV / AIDS awareness . Vazquez 's life is highlighted in the graphic novel , particularly her transition from the political uprising in Cuba to the vibrant LGBT community in San Francisco during the HIV / AIDS epidemic . <unk> , a work commenting on HIV / AIDS prevention , was collaborated with Gay Men 's Health Crisis . 
 Such educational comics have been criticised for ignoring the special relevance the subject has to the LGBT community , with homosexuality marginalized in favour of depicting HIV as a threat to conventional heterosexual relationships . This has been blamed on the continuing perception that comics are for young people , and as such should be " universalised " rather than targeting specific groups , and hence are heteronormative , failing to provide characters that LGBT @-@ <unk> young people can identify with . Other educational comic books such as the Swiss Jo ( 1991 ) also exclude explicit reference to homosexuality ( as well as drug @-@ taking and prostitution ) , in spite of their target audience being older . 
 = = Mainstream American comic books = = 
 Mainstream comics have historically excluded gay characters , with superhero comics in particular and the publishing houses Marvel and DC , the two largest publishers in the genre , and were criticized for their lack of inclusivity . Transgender characters have likewise been under @-@ represented , although the common storyline of a superhero having their sex changed by magical or technological means has been regarded as an oblique reference to transgender and transsexual issues . British comics author Neil Gaiman has said that he included transgender characters in his works , such as Sandman , in response to the lack of realistic representation of such people in comics . Queer theory analyses have noted that LGBT characters in mainstream comic books are often shown as assimilated into heterosexual society , whereas in alternative comics the diversity and uniqueness of LGBT culture is at the forefront . Mainstream comics have also been labelled as " heteronormative " , in comparison to " integrationist " alternative comics . 
 = = = Censorship and criticism = = = 
 For much of the 20th century , creators were strongly discouraged from depicting gay relationships in comic books , which were regarded as a medium for children . Until 1989 the Comics Code Authority ( CCA ) , which imposed de facto censorship on comics sold through newsstands in the United States , forbade any suggestion of homosexuality , and LGBT characters were excluded from comics bearing the CCA seal . The CCA itself came into being in response to Fredric Wertham 's Seduction of the Innocent , in which comic book creators were accused of attempting to negatively influence children with images of violence and sexuality , including subliminal homosexuality . Wertham claimed that Wonder Woman 's strength and independence made her a lesbian , and stated that " The Batman type of story may stimulate children to homosexual fantasies . " Storytellers subsequently had to drop subtle hints while not stating directly a character 's orientation . Overt gay and lesbian themes were first found later in underground and alternative titles which did not carry the CCA 's seal of approval . 
 In recent years the number of LGBT characters in mainstream superhero comics has increased greatly . At first gay characters appeared in supporting roles , but their roles have become increasingly prominent . The trend has prompted both praise from the LGBT community and organizations like the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation ( GLAAD ) , and criticism from conservative groups . Critics have made accusations that comics are attempting to subvert readers into a " gay lifestyle " , trying to " lure young American boys into the kinky web of homosexuality and AIDS " . 
 = = = DC = = = 
 The Encyclopedia of Gay Histories and Cultures ( 2000 ) notes that gay subtext can be found in DC Comics publications as early as the Golden Age of Comic Books , with readers inferring homosexuality between superheroes and their same @-@ sex sidekicks and on the women @-@ only Paradise Island . The introduction to Sandman Mystery Theatre : The Tarantula discusses this in the case of the replacement of Dian Belmont with Sandy , the Golden Boy in The Sandman serial in Adventure Comics . Batman 's relationship with Robin has famously come under scrutiny , in spite of the majority of creators associated with the character denying that the character is gay . Psychologist Fredric Wertham , who in Seduction of the Innocent asserted that " Batman stories are psychologically homosexual , " claimed to find a " subtle atmosphere of homoeroticism which pervades the adventures of the mature ' Batman ' and his young friend ' Robin . ' " It has also been claimed that Batman is interesting to gay audiences because " he was one of the first fictional characters to be attacked on the grounds of his presumed homosexuality , " and " the 1960s TV series remains a touchstone of camp . " Frank Miller has described the Joker as a " homophobic nightmare , " and views the character as sublimating his sexual urges into crime fighting . Burt Ward has also remarked upon this interpretation in his autobiography , noting that the relationship between the two could be interpreted as a sexual one . 
 In the first appearance of the <unk> , a fat man who seems to be a closet homosexual gay basher repeatedly calls Jim Rook a " cutie pie , " compliments his hair , and grabs his girlfriend , saying ( to Rook ) " And what ? You gonna hit me with your purse ? " after which his friends start hitting Rook with a chair . 
 The first obviously gay character was Extraño , an effeminate Peruvian man whose name means " Strange " in Spanish , who was created by Steve Englehart and Joe Staton and appeared in Millennium and New Guardians in 1987 . New Guardians was not successful , but during its short run it also featured one team member , Jet , contracting AIDS . The series was controversial , as several characters on the team were infected with HIV through the scratch of a character called the <unk> @-@ Goblin . Many angry letters were printed in response to this misinformation about HIV transmission , along with some gay readers <unk> that Extraño was too stereotypical . An official aftermath to Millennium , The Spectre ( vol . 2 ) # 11 , depicted a " mostly male and mostly gay " AIDS rally . Several characters , including the Enchantress ( describing them as " filthy disgusting men " ) and a police helicopter pilot named Ed ( screaming about " fags " ) are influenced into attempting to crush the rally by a seven @-@ headed spirit . Thanks to the actions of the Spectre , Doctor Fate , Deadman , Madame Xanadu ( later herself revealed to be bisexual ) , and Ben Turner , the men are saved . In 1988 's Wonder Woman Annual # 1 , Kevin Mayer , brother of Diana 'a late publicist <unk> Mayer , shows up at her will reading , saying she was the only member of the family who didn 't hate him for being gay . Mitch <unk> , mechanic for Task Force X , is a gay dad . Simon La Grieve , the organization 's head psychiatrist , refers to this as his " choice of sexuality " and wonders how <unk> 's son is adjusting . Priest Kramer counsels Mitch and tells him that his homosexuality is a natural part of himself that does not conflict with Christian scripture . The early 1990s saw a few more LGBT minor characters portrayed in DC titles . John Constantine dealt with gay bashers in Hellblazer # 6 and 7 and Swamp Thing # 74 ( 1988 ) . In the latter issue , Constantine , having jumped from a train at the end of Hellblazer # 6 , is found by gay bashers in a weakened state and severely beaten until rescued by Swamp Thing . While Constantine is not gay ( he is bisexual but is mostly sexually active with women ) , some of his gay friends were beaten and hospitalized , and he tried to protect them . In this case , the gay bashers were working at the behest of the demon , Nergal . Both this run and The Sandman story arcs Preludes and Nocturnes and The Kindly Ones arc featured elderly gay men . Transsexual themes were explored in the The Sandman : A Game of You story ( 1991 ) and in a 1992 storyline in Legion of Super @-@ Heroes . Notable storylines featuring LGBT themes include the coming out of Kyle Rayner 's assistant and an arc about his " gay bashing " in Green Lantern . These stories earned the writer title two GLAAD awards and a Gaylactic Spectrum Awards ( and a further nomination ) . Green Lantern also has a lesbian couple , Lee and Li , as supporting characters . An example of a gay character in a starring role is the violent vigilante superhero Midnighter , who appears in comic books published by Wildstorm , an imprint of DC Comics . The Batman @-@ like Midnighter was revealed to be in a relationship with the Superman @-@ like Apollo during their time as members of the superhero team The Authority . 
 The comic book Manhunter ( which focused on a female lawyer hunting down super villains who dodged trial ) was notable for featuring the gay supporting character of Damon Matthews , a well @-@ adjusted gay lawyer who later starts dating superhero Obsidian . In 2006 DC drew widespread media attention by announcing a new , lesbian incarnation of the well @-@ known character Batwoman . The number of minor DC characters being identified as LGBT continues to increase , and includes the bisexual superheroes Sarah Rainmaker and <unk> , and the reformed villain Pied Piper . <unk> Renee Montoya , introduced in Batman : The Animated Series without any stated sexual preference , was eventually introduced in the comic books as a lesbian and made considerably more butch . She was a main character in Gotham Central and 52 . 
 In 2011 , DC launched its The New 52 program , which introduced a number of new titles . In addition to a new Batwoman series , DC released Voodoo , which featured an African American bisexual woman as the title character . Additionally , The New 52 also introduced Bunker , the first openly @-@ gay superhero ever to be featured in the Teen Titans ongoing series . Another of the changes brought about with the DC reboot was the reinvention of a classic character as an out gay man , with DC as of 2012 depicting its longtime Green Lantern Alan Scott as a gay man in stories set on the parallel world of Earth @-@ 2 . 
 = = = Marvel = = = 
 Marvel Comics ' incorporation of LGBT themes has been unfavorably compared with that of DC ; its use of gay characters has been described as " less prolific but more deliberate " . Marvel reportedly had a " No Gays in the Marvel Universe " policy during Jim Shooter 's 1980s tenure , and Marvel 's policy from the 1990s had stated that all series emphasizing solo gay characters must carry an " Adults Only " label , in response to conservative protests . However , these policies did not stop creators from slipping in gay characters and themes ; J.M. DeMatteis introduced Arnie Roth , a childhood friend of Steve Rogers , who comes to Cap seeking help in rescuing his " roommate " Michael . Later , Arnie himself is captured by Baron <unk> and forced to dress in flamboyant clothes and stage make @-@ up and give a speech about how his love for Michael is false and unnatural . Cap rescues Arnie and reassures him that his love for Michael is as genuine as Cap 's own love for his girlfriend , Sharon . The story appears to have gone under the radar purely because DeMatteis did not use the word " gay " . Subsequent official character biographies have confirmed Arnie Roth as gay . As of 2006 , these policies are no longer enforced and LGBT characters appear regularly in Marvel comics . Although same @-@ sex couples are depicted occasionally kissing , intimate or sexual scenes have not been shown , even in Marvel 's " Adult only " imprint . The use of mutants and the discrimination they face in the X @-@ Men comics has been seen as a metaphor for the real @-@ world discrimination directed at minority groups including LGBT people . 
 Alpha Flight 's Northstar , a member of the original Alpha Flight superhero team , was the first major gay character created by Marvel Comics . Creator John Byrne said that Northstar was planned to be gay from his inception in 1979 . The character was finally revealed to be gay in 1992 's Alpha Flight issue 106 , the only comic book issue to have been inducted into the Gaylactic Hall of Fame . Storylines involving Northstar in Alpha Flight and his limited series have generally ignored his sexuality : Criticism has been levelled at the fact that in 30 years Northstar has never been shown kissing another man , though he finally kissed his boyfriend Kyle in the first issue of the 2011 relaunch of the series . Northstar eventually became a member of the X @-@ Men . During his time in this team he became a mentor to gay teenage mutant Anole , who later became a Young X @-@ Men member along with another gay teen , Graymalkin . 
 Other LGBT members of Marvel 's mutant teams are the Uncanny X @-@ Men Benjamin Deeds , New Mutant Karma , X @-@ Statix 's Phat , <unk> , and Bloke ( until their deaths ) and the villains Mystique and Destiny . In the latest incarnation of X @-@ Factor , written by Peter David , depowered mutant Rictor and his longtime friend Shatterstar ( with whom he 'd had an ambiguous relationship ) were shown in an on @-@ panel kiss . After the issue was published , Peter David confirmed Rictor and Shatterstar 's bisexuality in his blog and expressed his desire to develop the relationship between them further . Shortly after , one of Shatterstar 's creators , Rob Liefeld , expressed his disapproval of Peter David 's decision and has stated that should he get the chance , he will undo Rictor and Shatterstar 's bisexuality . Despite his complaints , however , both Peter David and Marvel editor @-@ in @-@ chief Joe Quesada have defended the development , and the story will most likely go on as planned . David went on to win the 2011 <unk> Media Award for Outstanding Comic Book for his work . 
 In 1997 , writer Ivan Velez , Jr . , who had previously written for the adult underground , Gay Comix , reintroduced Jennifer Kale with a closely cropped " butch " haircut in the pages of Ghost Rider , portrayed her as related to both Johnny Blaze and Daniel Ketch , and said that an issue of Howard the Duck had shown Jennifer and Doctor Strange as those who initially brought Howard to Earth @-@ 616 ( no such issue of Howard the Duck exists , and Jennifer and Doctor Strange did not meet until Man @-@ Thing ( vol . 2 ) # 4 ( May 1980 ) ) , after Howard 's series had concluded ) . In issue # 92 ( January 1998 ) , he depicted Ketch having a vision of life without Ghost Rider in which Jennifer had been in a relationship with a woman , Marie , for three years . Jennifer 's first boyfriend , <unk> , was shown in Fear # 13 ( April 1973 ) and # 18 ( November 1973 ) and Man @-@ Thing ( vol . 2 ) # 4 ( May 1980 ) , by which point they had broken up over Jennifer 's sorcery . She was shown sharing a bed with a chubby boyfriend named Bernard Drabble in The Legion of Night ( October 1991 ) , which was written by her creator , Steve Gerber ( later writer of the GLAAD Award @-@ nominated Hard Time ) , who thought making her related to both Ghost Riders was bad writing , saying that Marvel should change its name to DC for " Deliverance Comics " for being so inbred ( he did not read the issues in question , nor was he told of Jennifer 's newfound lesbianism ) . In Witches , Brian Patrick Walsh presents her with the attitude that having slept with women makes her a " bad girl " as a direct character foil to Topaz as a " good girl " ( which does not match earlier portrayals of Topaz ) , and <unk> as " the ugly . " In Marvel Zombies 4 , Topaz teasingly calls Jennifer " girlfriend " to be ironic . Her entry in the Official Handbook of the Marvel Universe now states that she is bisexual . 
 In 2002 , Marvel revived Rawhide Kid in their Marvel MAX imprint , introducing the first openly gay comic book character to star in his own magazine . The first edition of the Rawhide Kid ’ s gay saga was called Slap Leather . The character ’ s sexuality is conveyed indirectly , through euphemisms and puns , and the comic ’ s style is campy . Conservative groups protested the gay take on the character , which they claimed would corrupt children , and the covers carried an " Adults only " label . 
 The Young Avengers series , which debuted in 2005 , featured two gay teenager major characters , Hulkling and Wiccan , from its inception . The characters ' sexuality was criticised by some readers and defended by the writers in an extended series of letters on the title 's letters page . The Young Avengers earned Marvel its first GLAAD Award Best Comic Book Award in 2005 . The 2013 Young Avengers by Kieron Gillen won a second GLAAD Award , awarded both to Gillen and artist Jamie <unk> . In that series Gillen revealed nearly the entire team as some form of LGBT , including Prodigy ( David Alleyne ) , Miss America and Noh @-@ <unk> . 
 Xavin is a non @-@ binary / genderqueer Skrull ( a race of shape @-@ shifters ) from the award @-@ winning series , Runaways . Xavin was created by author Brian K. Vaughan and artist Adrian Alphona , and debuted in Runaways vol . 2 # 7 . Xavin had first appeared to the Runaways in their masculine form , but changed into their feminine form for the sake of Karolina Dean , a lesbian hero whom they were to marry . In the series , Xavin often switches between their two forms . 
 In April 2015 Marvel Comics announced that its X @-@ Men character Iceman , Bobby Drake was gay . In the " All @-@ New X @-@ Men " comic book storyline , the mind @-@ reading mutant Jean Grey asks Bobby why he calls women " hot , " when she knows he is gay .

 In September 2010 Archie Comics introduced an openly gay character , Kevin Keller in Veronica # 202 , though it was only published in the U.S. and Canada . In the story , Veronica quickly falls for the new @-@ boy @-@ in @-@ town , with a sweet smile and chiseled good looks , Kevin . Kevin beats Jughead in a burger @-@ eating contest , and he tells Jughead that he 's not interested in Veronica because he 's gay . Unbeknownst to Kevin , Jughead has a score to settle with Veronica . So , when Jughead requests for Kevin not tell Veronica about his sexuality , Kevin willingly agrees . The bulk of the story is about Veronica 's cluelessness . 
 As widely considered traditional , predictable , and wholesome publishers to the nth degree for generations , Archie Comics ' open recognition of homosexuality through the addition of Kevin Keller came as a surprise to many readers . However , as Lyle Masaki of AfterElton.com recognizes , " There is a long @-@ standing misconception that sexuality has to be a part of a gay character , but being gay doesn 't have anything to do with sex . " Kevin went on to star in his own mini @-@ series , and now is the star of his own digest @-@ size series , and guest starred in the Life with Archie : The Married Life series , with the issue depicting his wedding becoming one of the fastest selling Archie comics in decades . 
 = = = Other publishers = = = 
 The 1990s saw the creation of a number of independent publishing houses with output that competed with the giants of mainstream comics publishing , Marvel and DC . The companies included Malibu Comics , Image Comics ( such as Hisao and <unk> from Morning Glories ) and later , Dark Horse Comics . These companies gave greater artistic freedom to their writers and artists and chose not to ascribe to the Comics Code , allowing exploration of more mature themes . As a result , comics from these companies included a greater relative number of LGBT characters and storylines than their more traditional competitors . LGBT superhero characters include Spectral and Turbo Charge ( from Malibu comics ) , and Gen13 's Sarah Rainmaker ( created by Wildstorm for Image Comics before being taken over by DC ) . Colleen Doran 's A Distant Soil , dating back to the black and white independent movement of the 1980s , and published by Image since 1996 , featured openly gay characters as the romantic leads that gained the series a Gaylactic Spectrum Award nomination . 
 Dark Horse 's Buffy the Vampire Slayer @-@ related comics feature the lesbian characters of Willow , Tara and Kennedy and the closeted character Andrew from the television series . The Buffy Season Eight comics attracted media attention when the title character has a one night stand with another girl who had fallen in love with her . The encounter was repeated , but both the character and the creators denied that this made Buffy gay , with Joss Whedon saying : " We 're not going to make her gay , nor are we going to take the next 50 issues explaining that she 's not . She 's young and experimenting , and did I mention open @-@ minded ? " .

 As the visibility of LGBT comic book creators and characters has increased , comic book fandom has taken notice . Panels discussing LGBT topics occur regularly at comic book and LGBT conventions such as Comicon and Gaylaxicon , and conventions also feature stands dedicated to LGBT comics . Ted <unk> , event chair of Prism Comics said in 2008 , “ We ’ re in our sixth year of exhibiting at Comic @-@ Con , presenting a larger booth and more panels and events than ever before . ” A number of websites dedicated to LGBT comic book fandom and featuring content from staff writers exist , such as <unk> , <unk> and <unk> 
 The first GLAAD Award for Best Comic Book was awarded in 1992 ( to DC 's The Flash ) . Since then , a number of GLAAD awards have been awarded to mainstream titles , including for DC 's Green Lantern and The Authority titles , and Marvel 's Young Avengers . According to Paul Lopez , LGBT fans and creators have " debated whether the awards for mainstream comics were more about media hype than the actual content of the comic 's stories . " 
 The Gaylactic Spectrum Awards are given to works of science fiction , fantasy or horror , and their " Other Works " category allows nomination of comic book series or individual issues . Comic book winners include issues of DC 's Green Lantern , The Authority and Gotham Central , and nominations have been given to titles from Marvel ( X @-@ Force , X @-@ Statix ) , Dark Horse ( Buffy Season 8 ) and Image Comics . 
 = = European comics = = 
 Comics from continental Europe have been described as having a greater range of " themes , narratives and forms of visual impact " than English @-@ language comics , but have been superseded in popularity by American comics since the mid @-@ 1980s , with only French comics matching the popularity of Japanese and American comics . The lack of a " comics code " equivalent to the US system has made the incorporation of LGBT themes less controversial . This is exemplified by the Kelly Green graphic novels ( 1982 – 93 ) , created by Stan Drake and Leonard Starr . Drake and Starr are American cartoonists who chose to publish in France , where they would not be limited by US censorship and " could write and draw anything they wanted " ; this included episodes in which the vigilante title character dresses as a boy to lure a gay villain into an ambush , and a stereotypically gay secondary character who ran a strip @-@ club . 
 At the beginning of the 20th century , French and Belgian comic strips ( " Bande Dessinée " ) had become regarded as an medium for children – this restricted their inclusion of adult and sexual themes , and lasted until at least the 1960s . However , early Franco @-@ Belgian comics for children such as The Adventures of Tintin , Asterix , and The Adventures of Alix have also had sexual and LGBT subtext inferred by readers . Readers of Tintin books have speculated about his sexuality , leading to Marcel <unk> , spokesperson of Studios Hergé , saying that Tintin is macho and not homosexual ; Tintin has many male friends , but they are not boyfriends . The Adventures of Alix comics by Jacques Martin are amongst the most prominent historical comics , and the text concerns the restoration of a moral order , but with a " homosexual subtext that may have been invisible to the original readers " , which includes the portrayal of a close relationship between Alix and his companion <unk> and the full frontal depiction of teenage male bodies . Martin has disputed any gay readings of the central friendship in the books , but an article in Le Palace still called the " heroes <unk> de notre <unk> " . 
 Strips in the 1960s strove to break taboos , but were still censored by a law passed in 1949 that assumed comics were for children , which prevented the inclusion of explicit sexual themes , as in Barbarella album ( 1964 ) , which had to be redrawn to remove nudity . The late 1960s saw greater acceptance of comic strips as a mature artform , and their use as social commentary and satire was established in mainstream newspapers by the 1970s , although some anthologies continued to be banned as " pornographic " . 
 The works of French comic book creator Fabrice Neaud have been described as the " most ambitious autobiographical comics project yet published " . These include his 1994 series Ego Comme X and the ongoing Journal , of which Neaud has self @-@ published one volume every other year since 1996 . The works chronicle day to day experiences and place them in a framework that examines representation and self @-@ identity of sexual @-@ minorities and the creative process . Volumes one and three focus on the author 's homosexuality and status as a struggling gay artist in French small @-@ town life : One story arc covered Neaud 's unrequited love for a male friend . Neaud 's works have been pointed to as examples that legitimised comics as serious literature , and elevated the regard for autobiographical works within comics . The retrospective and subjective nature of the works leads to significant emotional events being afforded greater coverage , with the result that issues of sexuality and interactions between the author and other men are highlighted , reflecting the importance of sexuality to identity . This has led critic ( and character ) <unk> Goblet to dismiss the works as trivial ; such criticisms have been attributed to bias against autobiography or comics , or inability to identify with a gay character . 
 Frank <unk> 's most famous strips follow the lives of working class heterosexual men centered around the character of " suburban rocker " Lucien , and occasionally feature LGBT themes that show the characters ' assumptions of stereotypes . In <unk> Rocky , the characters dress as the Village People and when a stereotypically gay character tries to chat @-@ up Lucien in Le Retour ( 1993 ) , he remains oblivious to the attempt . These occurrences have been noted to be about reaffirming their masculinity by comparison with non @-@ masculine gay stereotypes , rather than depictions of homophobia . The relationship between social class and sexual orientation is also explored when a character is arrested by vice police in a park along with a number of gay couples and is humiliated by the police officers homophobic insults . In Comme s 'il en <unk> ( 2001 ) , the same character finds that the assumption that he is gay , due to a close male friendship , is to his benefit when in fashionable literary groups , where he is seen as more interesting and trendy . 
 Spanish comics have been described as less conventional and more diverse than American comics . <unk> , by creator Nazario Luque , is a " bizarre noir thriller " starring a gay transvestite detective . <unk> has been " widely celebrated " as one of the foremost subversive and countercultural comics that challenges preconceptions of sexuality and gender . Luque is openly gay and also writes the underground comic El <unk> . However , <unk> Pérez @-@ Sánchez says that the subversive impact of underground comics is less than one might expect , in comparison to mainstream and government @-@ subsidised comics , as the readers of underground comics are unlikely to be shocked . The " veiled " queer content that appears in the Socialist government @-@ sanctioned <unk> has a greater impact . 
 In Germany , the openly gay cartoonist Ralf König has created several popular comics taking an ironic but affectionate view on both gay and straight relationships . In 1979 he began creating comic strips that appeared in the Munich underground magazine <unk> and the gay periodical Rosa <unk> . In 1981 , his first comics <unk> , Das <unk> Comic @-@ Book and <unk> ( <unk> ) were published by Verlag Rosa Winkel in Berlin . In 1987 he wrote his first comic with a continuous story ( <unk> des <unk> ) . These comics have a large gay fan base , and despite initial skepticism from broader comics audiences due to the work 's consistent " gay culture " setting , have also gained great popularity among heterosexual readers . Several of König 's comics have been adapted into films ; his work has sold more than 5 million copies and been translated into 14 languages . 
 British comics were for significant parts of the 20th century regarded as being aimed at children , hence avoiding adult themes . One exception is 2000 AD , a more mature and violent comic book . 2000 AD introduced its first openly gay hero in 1992 in the story Swimming in Blood , in the form of the camp vampire exorcist Devlin Waugh . Waugh was created by writer John Smith and artist Sean Phillips and his character 's homosexuality is frequently referenced in the strip ; in his first story he attempts to seduce one of the men he is rescuing . The character was deliberately created in opposition to such characters as Judge Dredd and Johnny Alpha , gruff , macho men . Waugh , by contrast , was camp , flippant and flamboyant . In the annual poll of readers ' opinions , Waugh became the first and last character ever to knock Judge Dredd off the top spot as Favourite Strip . However , the character was not used for seven years after his initial introduction , due to production problems . In the British small press Martin Eden launched Spandex , which claimed to be " the world 's first all @-@ gay superhero team " . 
 = = Japanese comics = = 
 Comics are an established art form in Japan , which has the biggest comic book industry in the world . Comics are respected and aimed at both child and adult audiences . Sex and violence are common , and their presence in fictional manga is regarded as a " safety valve " . 
 = = = Yaoi and Yuri = = = 
 Yaoi and Yuri ( also known as Boys ' Love and Girls ' Love , respectively ) are Japanese genres incorporating homosexual romance themes across various media . The genres emerged in the 1970s in a branch of manga aimed at girls . Yaoi and yuri have spread beyond Japan : both translated and original yaoi and yuri are now available in many countries and languages . The characters in yaoi and yuri manga do not tend to self @-@ identify as homosexual or bisexual . Famous works include <unk> no Tenshi ( The Angel that Came from the Sun ) , an 11 @-@ volume series beginning in 1980 that reinterprets the life of the introducer of Buddhism to Japan ; and Kaze to Ki no Uta ( Poem of the Wind and the Trees ) , a 17 @-@ volume series beginning in 1976 that chronicles the relationship between two schoolboys in France . 
 As with much manga and anime , science fiction and fantasy tropes and environments are common : Ai no <unk> , a 1980s yaoi light novel series described as a " magnum opus " of the Boys Love genre , involves a science fictional caste system . <unk> has been described as " a wonderful sci fi series " which does not have to rely on its yuri content to appeal to the audience . The various terminologies for both male / male pairings and female / female pairings are sometimes used to denote the level of sexual explicitness or romanticism in a work . Although yuri originated in female @-@ targeted works , today it is featured in male @-@ targeted ones as well . 
 Yaoi has been criticised for stereotypical and homophobic portrayals of its characters , and for failing to address gay issues . Homophobia , when it is presented as an issue at all , is often used as a plot device to " heighten the drama " , or to show the purity of the leads ’ love . Matt Thorn has suggested that as yaoi is a romance narrative , strong political themes may be a " turn off " to the readers . Critics state that the genre challenges heteronormativity via the " queer " bishōnen ( " beautiful boys " ) , and Andrew Grossman has written that the Japanese are more comfortable with writing about LGBT themes in a manga setting , in which gender is often blurred , even in " straight " manga . 
 = = = Bara and " gay comics " = = = 
 There also exists " gay manga " ( called Bara ( rose ) ) specifically targeted at gay men , with gay characters . Yaoi writers and fans distinguish these " gay manga " from yaoi , sometimes calling it " bara " . Prior to the early 2000s , the primary venue for publication of gay men 's manga was gay men 's general @-@ interest magazines , which have included manga since the inception of <unk> in 1971 . The typical manga story in these magazines is an 8 – 24 page one @-@ shot , although some magazines , notably G @-@ men , also carry some serialized stories . McLelland , surveying gay men 's magazines from the mid to late 1990s , indicates that most manga stories were simply pornographic , with little attention to character or plot , and that even the longer , serialized stories were generally " thinly developed " . McLelland characterizes <unk> as containing " some well @-@ crafted stories which might be better described as erotic rather than pornographic " , while the manga in G @-@ men were " more relentlessly sexual " , with less attention to characterization and mood . 
 The 1990s saw increased media focus on LGBT people in Japan , and a large increase in the production of such works written by gay men . <unk> Tagame has been called the most influential creator of gay manga in Japan to date . Most of his work first appeared in gay magazines and usually feature sexual abuse . Much of <unk> Tagame 's early work was published in the magazine G @-@ men , which was founded in 1994 to cater to gay men who preferred " macho fantasy " , as opposed to the sleeker , yaoi @-@ inspired styles popular in the 1980s . Like most gay men 's general @-@ interest magazines , G @-@ men included manga as well as prose stories and editorial and photographic material . G @-@ men encouraged steady readership by presenting a better @-@ defined fantasy image , and with serialized , continuing manga stories which encouraged purchase of every issue . Tagame 's depiction of men as muscular and hairy has been cited as a catalyst for a shift in fashion amongst gay men in 1995 , away from the clean @-@ shaven and slender stereotypes of Yaoi and towards a tendency for masculinity and <unk> . Tagame 's work has been criticised by notable gay manga writer Susumu Hirosegawa for its lack of complex storylines . Susumu Hirosegawa 's early works were yaoi , but later Hirosegawa moved into gay manga . Hirosegawa 's works sometimes contain no sex at all , with greater focus on plot , but when sex is present it is often in the form of sadomasochism or rape , in which the victim learns to enjoy the experience . Bara manga 's popularity has continued to increase , with four major publishers of bara manga anthologies in today 's Japan .

 Pornographic manga and anime for men , frequently called hentai in the West , often contains depictions of lesbianism for the titillation of male readers , examples being Demon Beast Invasion ( 1994 ) and Twin Angels ( 1995 ) . <unk> are common character types in hentai ; they are transgender or intersex figures , often female , with penises . 
 Mainstream , non @-@ pornographic manga also frequently contains explorations of gender and sex roles , although usually for purposes of exoticism or comedy rather than in a realistic manner . Some supporting characters cross @-@ dress , such as <unk> from Fushigi <unk> , and some series are centred around the idea of changing sex , such as Ranma ½ , whose protagonist changes sex , but not gender , when splashed with cold water .

 = SS Empire Miniver = 
 The SS Empire Miniver was a British steam merchant ship . She was originally an American merchant , launched in 1918 as SS West Cobalt . During a brief stint in the United States Navy in 1919 , she was known as USS West Cobalt ( ID @-@ 3836 ) . 
 SS West Cobalt was built as a steam @-@ powered cargo ship in 1918 for the United States Shipping Board ( USSB ) . She was part of the West boats , a series of steel @-@ hulled cargo ships built on the West Coast of the United States for the First World War war effort , and was the 11th ship built at Columbia River Shipbuilding Company in Portland , Oregon . Though she was completed too late for the war , she was commissioned into the Naval Overseas Transportation Service ( NOTS ) of the United States Navy as USS West Cobalt ( ID @-@ 3836 ) in January 1919 . After her one overseas trip for the Navy — delivering grain products to Danzig — she was decommissioned in May 1919 and returned to the USSB . 
 West Cobalt had a relatively uneventful merchant career for the USSB and , after her 1933 sale , for the Lykes Brothers Steamship Company . In June 1940 , West Cobalt was sold to British interests and renamed Empire Miniver . Just over four months later , the ship was torpedoed and sunk by German submarine U @-@ 99 while carrying supplies to the UK in Convoy SC @-@ 7 during the Second World War . Three crewmen were killed in the attack ; the master and 34 others were rescued by a British corvette .

 The West ships were cargo ships of similar size and design built by several shipyards on the West Coast of the United States for the United States Shipping Board ( USSB ) for emergency use during the First World War . All were given names that began with the word West , like West Cobalt , the ninth of some 30 West ships built by the Columbia River Shipbuilding Company of Portland , Oregon . West Cobalt ( Columbia River Shipbuilding yard number 11 ) was launched on 26 October 1918 , and was completed in December . 
 West Cobalt was 5 @,@ 724 gross register tons ( GRT ) , and was 410 feet 1 inch ( 124 @.@ 99 m ) long ( between perpendiculars ) and 54 feet 0 inches ( 16 @.@ 46 m ) abeam .

Her hold was 29 feet 9 inches ( 9 @.@ 07 m ) deep and she had a deadweight tonnage of 8 @,@ 028 DWT . West Cobalt 's power plant consisted of a single steam turbine driving a single screw propeller which moved the ship at up to 11 knots ( 20 km / h ) .

 Upon completion of West Cobalt in December 1918 , a month after the end of fighting in the First World War , she was handed over to the United States Navy for use in the Naval Overseas Transportation Service ( NOTS ) . She was commissioned as USS West Cobalt ( ID @-@ 3836 ) on 29 December at the Puget Sound Navy Yard in Bremerton , Washington , with Lieutenant Commander Andrew Patterson , USNRF , in command . 
 After undergoing sea trials , West Cobalt sailed for San Pedro , California , on 11 January to load a cargo of grain on behalf of the American Relief Administration . Six days later , West Cobalt headed for Norfolk , Virginia , where she arrived on 10 February . After fuel replenishment , West Cobalt sailed on 19 February for Plymouth , where she arrived on 11 March , the Hook of Holland , and Danzig . After delivering her cargo , used to help feed the hungry in the aftermath of the war , she steamed for New York on 8 April . After reaching New York on 24 April , West Cobalt was decommissioned on 5 May and returned to the USSB .

 Many details of West Cobalt 's post @-@ Navy career remain undiscovered , but mentions in shipping reports in contemporary newspapers offer hints at her activities . In 1924 , for example , reports in The New York Times mention a departure from New York for Manchester on 27 August , and an arrival at Liverpool on 8 September . By 1930 , West Cobalt was reported in The Washington Post as sailing on a New Orleans – London route . On 15 October of that year , the captain and four other officers of West Cobalt were arrested at New Orleans after 12 US quarts ( 11 L ) of liquor — against the law under Prohibition — were found on board the ship . The five men were held under $ 1 @,@ 000 bond each . 
 In 1933 , West Cobalt was sold to the Lykes Brothers Steamship Company , which assigned her to its Ripley Steamship Company subsidiary . During the 1930s , Lykes Brothers operated cargo ships between Gulf Coast and Caribbean ports , and though there is little specific information available regarding West Cobalt 's movements , it is likely that she called at Gulf coast and Caribbean ports as well . One specific mention of the ship is found in a report in The New York Times in 1937 , when the newspaper reported West Cobalt 's arrival in New York on 30 October , ten days after sailing from New Orleans .

 In June 1940 , the United States Maritime Commission ( USMC ) granted permission to Lykes to sell West Cobalt and three other ships to the Bank Line of Glasgow for transfer to British registry . West Cobalt , loaded with scrap iron , sailed from Hampton Roads , Virginia , on 28 June for Halifax . After arriving there on 2 July , West Cobalt sailed the next day in Convoy HX @-@ 55 for Liverpool . On the night of 15 / 16 July , West Cobalt dropped astern of the convoy and was last sighted at 01 : 00 by British merchant ship Loch Don . West Cobalt continued on , however , and reached Liverpool independently on 18 July . 
 Soon transferred to the Ministry of War Transport , the newly renamed ship , now named Empire Miniver , was assigned to Andrew Weir & Co. of London for operation . She sailed from Liverpool in her first wartime convoy under her new name , Convoy OB @-@ 205 , on 29 August 1940 . The convoy dispersed the next day after coming under attack from at least four German submarines : U @-@ 59 , U @-@ 38 , U @-@ 60 , and U @-@ 101 . Though three ships from the convoy were sunk , two were damaged , and a sixth was a total loss , Empire Miniver arrived at Hampton Roads , on 15 September and at Baltimore two days later . 
 After a nine @-@ day turnaround , Empire Miniver sailed independently to Sydney , Nova Scotia , with a cargo of 4 @,@ 500 tons of pig iron and 6 @,@ 200 tons of steel , arriving on 2 October . At Sydney , she joined the ill @-@ fated Convoy SC @-@ 7 , bound for Newport , for her return journey . The convoy had only a single escort to start with , the sloop Scarborough .

Empire Miniver was torpedoed and sunk by U @-@ 99 at 22 : 06 on 18 October , while some 100 nautical miles ( 190 km ) west by south of Barra Head . Out of a total complement of 38 , three crew members were lost . The master and 34 crew members were picked up by Bluebell and were landed at Greenock on 20 October .

 Cerro Blanco is a caldera in the Andes of the Catamarca Province in Argentina . Part of the Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes , it is a volcano collapse structure located at an altitude of 4 @,@ 670 metres ( 15 @,@ 320 ft ) in a depression . The caldera is associated with a less well defined caldera to the south and several lava domes . 
 The caldera has been active for the last eight million years and eruptions have created several ignimbrites . One of the most recent eruptions occurred 73 @,@ 000 years ago and formed the Campo de la Piedra Pómez ignimbrite layer . About 5 @,@ 000 years ago , the largest volcanic eruption of the Central Andes with a volcanic explosivity index of 7 occurred at Cerro Blanco , forming the most recent caldera as well as thick ignimbrite layers . About 110 cubic kilometres ( 26 cu mi ) of rhyolite were erupted then . The volcano is dormant since then with some deformation and geothermal activity . A major future eruption would put local communities to the south at risk . 
 The volcano is also known for giant ripple marks that have formed on its ignimbrite fields . Persistent wind action on the ground has shifted gravel and sand , forming wave @-@ like structures . These ripple marks have heights up to 1 metre ( 3 ft 3 in ) and are separated by distances up to 30 metres ( 98 ft ) . Unlike dunes , they do not migrate with the wind and are stationary . These ripple marks are among the most extreme on Earth and have been compared to Martian ripple marks by geologists .

 The Central Volcanic Zone of the Andes is an area between 14 – 28 ° southern latitude where volcanic activity dates to the Eocene . <unk> activity has occurred over the whole area , particularly north of 25 ° southern latitude where the Altiplano – Puna volcanic complex is situated . Ignimbrites are primarily rhyolite and rhyodacite and subordinate <unk> . The more southern ignimbrites are felsic and have a low crystal content . With the exception of the <unk> caldera and Cerro Galán , most volcanism south of 25 ° southern latitude is of low volume . After a phase of pyroclastic activity in the <unk> area during the Eocene , a number of volcanoes formed from calc @-@ alkaline magmas during the Miocene . Changes in subduction geometry including the removal of continental crust from the boundary 8 @-@ 3 mya have caused a thickening of the crust as well as an eastward shift of the volcanic front . <unk> volcano in Peru is part of the Central Volcanic Zone and had a major eruption in 1600 . 
 Most ignimbrites of the southern sector have volumes of 50 cubic kilometres ( 12 cu mi ) or less and are associated with stratovolcanoes and small calderas . They are derived from fractional crystallization of andesitic magmas with variable crustal input .

 Cerro Blanco is part of the Central Volcanic Zone and is located at the southern limit of the Puna . It forms a volcanic unit together with the Aguada Alumbrera ignimbrite , at the eastern edge of the Cordillera de San Buenaventura . Rocks beneath this unit include dacitic – trachyandesitic <unk> 9 – 7 mya old and an igneous @-@ metamorphic granitic basement containing <unk> , quartz of Neoproterozoic @-@ early Paleozoic age , containing paleozoic mafic to ultramafic volcanic inclusions . The Cordillera de San Buenaventura is formed from lava domes and volcanic complexes of intermediary composition of Upper Miocene – Quaternary age . During the Miocene @-@ Pleistocene , the isotope and chemical composition of areal magmas has moved away from arc like magmas to distinctly water @-@ poor and <unk> <unk> . This finding is consistent with a hot mantle forming after delamination of the crust and migration of the arc . 
 Nevado Tres Cruces lies to the west and Nevado Ojos del Salado lies to the southwest of the Cerro Blanco centre . East @-@ northeast running fault systems are controlled by local tectonics and may be responsible for the formation of the Cordillera de San Buenaventura . The 4 @-@ 3 @.@ 7 mya Laguna Amarga west of Cerro Blanco erupted rhyolites , unlike Cerro Blanco 's ignimbrites . The better known Cerro Galán caldera lies 80 kilometres ( 50 mi ) southwest of Cerro Blanco . It forms a northwest @-@ southeast volcanic line with Cerro Blanco and Incapillo . This line was active less than 2 @.@ 5 mya ago . Another trend is defined by the <unk> line running from Sierra Nevada over Cerro <unk> and Cerro <unk> to Blanco . Other volcanic centres in the region are the Miocene @-@ Pliocene ignimbrites Las Juntas and Las Papas . Minor bimodal – mafic volcanic centres during the Pleistocene – Holocene include volcanoes in the Pasto Ventura , Salar de Carachi Pampa and Volcán Negro <unk> <unk> . <unk> centres include <unk> and Cueros de Purulla . Cerro Purulla lies <unk> of Cerro Blanco and the La Hoyada volcanic complex lies directly west . 4 @,@ 380 metres ( 14 @,@ 370 ft ) Cueros de Purulla and 4 @,@ 290 metres ( 14 @,@ 070 ft ) <unk> are major sources of obsidian in the Puna of Catamarca region . 
 The Cerro Blanco complex is formed from pyroclastic flows extending from nested calderas . The Robledo caldera is heavily eroded and has assumed a semicircular shape . The rim of the Cerro Blanco caldera proper is well @-@ preserved , with ash and block flows filling the interior . Another theory holds that the northern Cerro Blanco and the southern Robledo calderas are part of one caldera with a minimum subsidence of 700 metres ( 2 @,@ 300 ft ) and a dimension of 13 by 10 kilometres ( 8 @.@ 1 mi × 6 @.@ 2 mi ) . The Cerro Blanco caldera is 6 kilometres ( 3 @.@ 7 mi ) wide . On its southern rim , surrounded by ashfall deposits , lies the Holocene Cerro Blanco del Robledo lava dome ( 26 ° 46 ′ 51 ″ S 67 ° 45 ′ 27 ″ W ) . Some sources call the whole volcano Robledo and use Cerro Blanco to refer to the lava dome . The whole volcanic complex is formed from lava domes , ignimbrites , ash and block flows and unconsolidated deposits . Cerro Blanco is the largest lava dome and has a debris collapse deposit on its northern side . A hydrothermally altered area in the middle of the caldera has been linked to phreatomagmatic activity . The El Escondido crater northeast of the caldera is 1 @.@ 2 kilometres ( 0 @.@ 75 mi ) wide and 40 metres ( 130 ft ) deep . It shows a dark colour and <unk> shape in satellite images and has been interpreted as a phreatic crater . The complex is located at the southwest end of a volcano @-@ tectonic depression formed by local fault systems . These fault systems channel magma during eruptions ; usually no eruption column is formed . The formation of the depression may be influenced by the emptying of magma chambers associated with the volcano . The complex is located on 60 kilometres ( 37 mi ) thick crust . A crustal low seismic velocity anomaly is located beneath Cerro Blanco , called the Southern Puna Magma Body .

 Mega ripple marks formed by gravel are also found in the Cerro Blanco area and are among the most extreme on Earth . These are formed from wind @-@ driven processes acting on local ignimbrites , including saltation of fine grains and sand during wind . Ripples have amplitudes varying 0 @.@ 1 – 2 metres ( 3 @.@ 9 in – 6 ft 6 @.@ 7 in ) and wavelengths of 10 – 30 metres ( 33 – 98 ft ) . Coarse gravel is found at their top and more fine silt in their lower parts . Pumice blocks are found in the lee surfaces of the ripples , with the <unk> areas relatively flat . Unlike dunes these structures do not migrate once stably formed . The material these structures is formed from includes lithic clasts with densities 2 @,@ 600 – 3 @,@ 000 kilograms per cubic metre ( 4 @,@ 400 – 5 @,@ 100 lb / cu yd ) and pumices with densities 800 – 1 @,@ 300 kilograms per cubic metre ( 1 @,@ 300 – 2 @,@ 200 lb / cu yd ) . The formation of the ripples is associated with bedrock ridges . These ripple marks have been compared to Martian ripple fields .

 The Puna climate in the area is a high desert climate with high insolation and long @-@ term aridity . The desert environment of the Puna results in low levels of erosion . Plant growth is minor . Wind speeds of 33 kilometres per hour ( 21 mph ) are regularly found and may play a role in the formation of <unk> .

 Human research in the San Buenaventura area goes back to <unk> 1885 , mineral @-@ focused research in 1895 and <unk> 1920 . The La Hoyada Formation was identified 1963 and reinterpreted as the La Hoyada volcanic complex in 2000 . General geological research in the region occurred 1988 , 2000 and 2006 , and research focused on Cerro Blanco was done by <unk> et al . 2005 and 2008 . 
 Activity of Cerro Blanco goes back 8 mya , when the Maricunga Belt in the west was active . The volcano is responsible for a large Holocene eruption with a Volcano explosivity index 7 , the largest in the Andean Central Volcanic Zone for 5000 years .

 The Aguada Alumbrera Ignimbrite is a white @-@ rosa ignimbrite composed from two units , 7 @.@ 14 mya Unidad Blanquecina and 13 @.@ 57 mya Unidad <unk> . The Blanquecina unit is of white to white @-@ rosa colour and contains amphibole , biotite and quartz crystals . It contains lithic fragments of dacitic composition . The groundmass of the ignimbrite is grey in colour and contains glass and phenocrysts . Next to Laguna Aguada Alumbrera it is 100 metres ( 330 ft ) thick . The ignimbrite is unconformably overlaid by ignimbrites from La Hoyada volcano and overlies the basement . There are fluvial deposits contained within the Blanquecina ignimbrite , suggesting that sedimentation occurred between the eruptions . The other subunit <unk> is of white colour and is rich in biotite and quartz . It is mostly buried by other deposits ; south of Aguada Alumbrera the principal deposit is 40 metres ( 130 ft ) thick . This ignimbrite crops out south of Cerro Blanco . 
 The Rosada Ignimbrite is located next to Cueros de Purulla and has a rosa colour , due to fiamme formed from welded pumice . The pumice contains biotite , hornblende and quartz . It also contains lithic fragments from the basement and from <unk> . Two dates of 6 @.@ 3 and 7 @.@ 3 mya have been obtained ; the younger age is likely the result from argon loss and less accurate . It and the Aguada Alumbrera ignimbrites are coeval but different compositions indicate that they derive from separate eruptions . The Rosada ignimbrite 's main minerals are biotite , quartz , plagioclase and sanidine . It has a volume of 50 cubic kilometres ( 12 cu mi ) .

The Carachi Ignimbrite overlies the Barranca Blanca ignimbrite . It is weakly welded and contains white pumice and crystals with fiamme . Both of these are pyroclastic density currents that were still hot at the time of deposition .

 2 @,@ 300 ± 160 BCE a large Plinian eruption occurred at Cerro Blanco . <unk> with a volume of 110 cubic kilometres ( 26 cu mi ) generated ashfalls and ignimbrites , forming the largest known eruption in the Central Andes during the Holocene .

The low population density in the <unk> valley south of the volcano during the 10 @,@ 000 – 3 @,@ 000 <unk> interval is ascribed to this eruption .

 There are no reports of historical activity . A small geothermal field is associated with the volcanic complex , consisting of fumaroles , mud volcanoes and thermal anomalies . 
 The caldera floor has been subsiding in the 1990s according to satellite images .

This deformation is centered between the Robledo and Cerro Blanco calderas and is accompanied by an uplift to the northwest . The deflation has been interpreted to depend on a magma chamber with a diametre of 17 kilometres ( 11 mi ) but is unlikely to be caused by magma withdrawal or tectonic expansion . It may be linked to hydrothermal effects however . A seismic swarm was noted at 15 kilometres ( 9 @.@ 3 mi ) depth in 2007 and 2009 . 
 Evidence indicates that such calderas can fill in within a timespan of hundreds to thousands of years . Two possible scenarios of an eruption are the formation of Plinian eruption columns or more tranquil <unk> eruption of pyroclastic flows from vents . Given the low population density of 0 @.@ 06 people per 1 square kilometre ( 0 @.@ 39 sq mi ) , the impact of the eruption on local population will be small . Westerly winds may cause larger impact west of the centre , with air travel particularly affected . The community of <unk> de <unk> 50 kilometres ( 31 mi ) south of the caldera is beneath the level of Cerro Blanco and connected to it by valleys . In a future eruption , pyroclastic currents and less dense clouds associated with them from Cerro Blanco might reach the community .

 Turbinellus floccosus , sometimes known as the <unk> , <unk> , or woolly chanterelle , is a <unk> mushroom of the family Gomphaceae native to Asia and North America . It was known as Gomphus floccosus until 2011 , when it was found to be only distantly related to the genus 's type species G. clavatus . It was consequently transferred from Gomphus to Turbinellus . The orange @-@ capped vase- or trumpet @-@ shaped fruiting structures may reach 30 cm ( 12 in ) high and 30 cm ( 12 in ) wide . The lower surface , the hymenium , is covered in wrinkles and ridges rather than gills or pores , and is pale buff or yellowish to whitish . 
 T. floccosus forms ectomycorrhizal relationships with various types of conifer ; fruit bodies may be found in coniferous woodlands across Eastern Asia , from North Korea to Pakistan , and in North America , more frequently in the west , in late summer and autumn . Though mild @-@ tasting , they cause gastrointestinal symptoms of nausea , vomiting and diarrhea when consumed . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 This species was first described as <unk> floccosus in 1834 by American mycologist Lewis David de Schweinitz , who reported it growing in beech woods in Mount Pocono , Pennsylvania . Its specific epithet is derived from the Latin floccus , meaning " flock of wool " . In 1839 , Miles Joseph Berkeley described a specimen from Canada as Cantharellus canadensis from a manuscript by Johann Friedrich Klotzsch , noting its affinity to C. clavatus . A large specimen collected in Maine by Charles James Sprague was described as Cantharellus princeps in 1859 by Berkeley and Moses Ashley Curtis . 
 In 1891 , German botanist Otto Kuntze published Revisio Generum Plantarum , his response to what he perceived as a lack of method in existing nomenclatural practice . Three taxa received new names : Kuntze coined the genus Trombetta , which incorporated Cantharellus canadensis ( as Trombetta canadensis ) , while C. floccosus and C. princeps became Merulius floccosus and M. princeps respectively . However , Kuntze 's revisionary program was not accepted by the majority of botanists . 
 Franklin Sumner Earle made C. floccosus the type species of the new genus Turbinellus in 1909 , remarking that " They constitute a striking and well @-@ marked genus which seems to have more in common with the club @-@ shaped species of Craterellus than with the following genus where they have always been placed . " However this was not widely taken up . Earle 's new combination was not published validly according to nomenclatural rules . 
 In 1945 it was transferred to Gomphus by Rolf Singer . The generic name is derived from the Ancient Greek <unk> , <unk> , meaning " plug " or " large wedge @-@ shaped nail " . Alex H. Smith treated the members of Gomphus as two sections — Gomphus and <unk> — within Cantharellus in his 1947 review of chanterelles in western North America , as he felt there were no consistent characteristics that distinguished the genera . The shaggy chanterelle was placed in the latter section due to its scaly cap , lack of clamp connections and rusty @-@ colored spores . Roger Heim classified it in the genus <unk> , before E. J. H. Corner returned it to Gomphus in 1966 . 
 The genus Gomphus , along with several others in the Gomphaceae , was reorganized in the 2010s after molecular analysis confirmed that the older morphology @-@ based classification did not accurately represent phylogenetic relationships . Thus the genus Turbinellus was resurrected and the taxon became Turbinellus floccosus . 
 T. floccosus has been given the common names of scaly vase chanterelle , scaly chanterelle , woolly chanterelle , or shaggy chanterelle , though it is more closely related to stinkhorns than true chanterelles . In Nepal , in the Sherpa language , it is known as <unk> chyau or <unk> chyau , from the words <unk> , meaning " oil lamp " and chyau , meaning " mushroom " , as the fruit bodies have a shape similar to the local oil lamps . In Mexico , it is known as <unk> or <unk> , or by the indigenous words <unk> , <unk> or <unk> in Tlaxcala . 
 = = Description = = 
 Adult fruit bodies are initially cylindrical , maturing to trumpet- or vase @-@ shaped and reaching up to 30 cm ( 12 in ) high and up to 30 cm ( 12 in ) across . There is no clear demarcation between the cap and stipe . The stipe itself can be up to 15 cm ( 6 in ) tall and 6 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) wide , though it tapers to a narrower base . It is solid in younger specimens , though is often hollowed out by insect larvae in older . At higher elevations , two or three fruit bodies may arise from one stipe . Colored various shades of reddish- to yellowish @-@ orange , the cap surface is broken into scales , with the spaces between more yellow and the scales themselves more orange . The most colorful specimens occur in warm humid weather . Older specimens are often paler . 
 The white flesh is fibrous and thick , though thins out in old specimens . Somewhat brittle , it can sometimes turn brown when cut or bruised . The smell has been reported as indistinct or " earthy and sweet " , and the taste " sweet and sour " . The spore @-@ bearing undersurface is irregularly folded , forked or ridged rather than gilled and is pale buff or yellowish to whitish in color . These ridges are up to 4 mm high . The surface is <unk> attached to the stipe , though irregularly so . The spore print is brownish , the spores ellipsoid with dimensions of 12 @.@ 4 – 16 @.@ 8 x 5 @.@ 8 – 7 @.@ 3 μm . The spore surface is roughened with ornamentations that can be made visible under the microscope by staining with methyl blue . 
 The fruit bodies can last for some considerable time , growing slowly over a month . Mushrooms in subalpine and alpine areas are typically heavy @-@ set with a short stipe , their growth slower in the cold climate . This form is slower growing , and is seen at lower altitudes in colder seasons . Smith gave this the name forma <unk> . Conversely , mushrooms at low altitudes , such as in the redwood forests , can grow and expand rapidly with large caps that have prominent scales . Smith described a paler form with a solid stipe from the Sierra Nevada as forma <unk> . R. H. Petersen described an olive @-@ capped form that is otherwise identical to the typical form . These forms are not recognised as distinct .

 The related Turbinellus kauffmanii , found in western North America , is similar @-@ looking but has a pale brown cap . Younger specimens of the latter species also have a pungent smell . Turbinellus <unk> , found in Japan , is another lookalike that has smaller spores than T. floccosus . The fruit bodies of Gomphus <unk> , found in northwestern North America , are typically more yellowish to brownish compared to T. floccosus , and they tend to fruit in clumps .

 The fungus appears to form ectomycorrhizal relationships with various conifers including Douglas @-@ fir ( Pseudotsuga menziesii ) , fir ( Abies ) species such as <unk> fir ( Abies firma ) , European silver fir ( A. alba ) and <unk> fir ( A. <unk> ) , Pine ( Pinus ) species such as Pinus densiflora and western hemlock ( Tsuga heterophylla ) . In Mexico , the fungus associates with Abies religiosa — the mycorrhizal association between these two species has been synthesized under controlled laboratory conditions . T. floccosus is more abundant in older stands of trees and places where there is more decomposed wood on the forest floor . The species occurs in coniferous forests in North America , particularly the western states in late summer and autumn . They are most abundant in rainy parts of the Pacific Northwest , northern California and the Sierra Nevada . It also occurs through Asia , having been recorded from India , Nepal , Pakistan , Tibet , China , North Korea , and Japan . 
 Turbinellus floccosus has been occasionally recorded from introduced conifer plantations in Australia . 
 = = Toxicity = = 
 Turbinellus floccosus is poisonous to some people who eat it , but has been eaten without incident by others . Nausea , vomiting and diarrhea may occur , though are sometimes delayed by up to 8 – 14 hours . A <unk> acid known as α @-@ <unk> or <unk> acid may be responsible for the extreme gastrointestinal symptoms . Laboratory experiments showed it increased tone of guinea pig smooth muscle of the small bowel ( ileum ) , and that when given to rats , it led to mydriasis , skeletal muscle weakness , and central nervous system depression . The concentration ( 4 @.@ 4 % ) of the presumed active ingredient — <unk> acid — extracted from fruit bodies of Turbinellus floccosus was over double that extracted from the related T. kauffmanii . 
 Despite its toxicity , T. floccosus is one of the ten wild mushrooms most widely consumed by ethnic tribes in Meghalaya , northeast India , and is highly regarded by the Sherpa people in the vicinity of Sagarmatha National Park in Nepal . What is not known is whether the populations of T. floccosus are lacking in the toxin , or whether the local people have developed an immunity to it . It is also eaten in Mexico . Mycologist David Arora reported some enjoyed it while he felt it had a sour taste that he found off @-@ putting . 
 The fruit body of T. floccosus produces <unk> ( biologically active lipids generated from fatty acids ) that have antifungal activity against the plant pathogens Colletotrichum <unk> , C. <unk> , and C. <unk> . Extracts of the fungus have shown in standard laboratory tests to have antimicrobial activity against several human pathogenic strains . T. floccosus also contains the <unk> derivative <unk> , a bioactive compound that inhibits DNA damage by hydroxyl radicals generated by the Fenton reaction . <unk> is responsible for the green color obtained when iron salts are applied to the fruit body surface . 
 = Hajj = 
 The Hajj ( / <unk> / ; Arabic : <unk> <unk> " pilgrimage " ) is an annual Islamic pilgrimage to Mecca , and a mandatory religious duty for Muslims that must be carried out at least once in their lifetime by all adult Muslims who are physically and financially capable of undertaking the journey , and can support their family during their absence . It is one of the five pillars of Islam , alongside Shahadah , Salat , <unk> , and <unk> . The Hajj is the largest annual gatherings of people in the world . The state of being physically and financially capable of performing the Hajj is called <unk> 'ah , and a Muslim who fulfills this condition is called a <unk> . The Hajj is a demonstration of the solidarity of the Muslim people , and their submission to God ( Allah ) . The word Hajj means " to intend a journey " , which connotes both the outward act of a journey and the inward act of intentions . 
 The pilgrimage occurs from the 8th to 12th ( or in some cases 13th ) of Dhu al @-@ Hijjah , the last month of the Islamic calendar . Because the Islamic calendar is lunar and the Islamic year is about eleven days shorter than the Gregorian year , the Gregorian date of Hajj changes from year to year . Ihram is the name given to the special spiritual state in which pilgrims wear two white sheets of seamless cloth and abstain from certain actions . 
 The Hajj is associated with the life of Islamic prophet Muhammad from the 7th century , but the ritual of pilgrimage to Mecca is considered by Muslims to stretch back thousands of years to the time of Abraham . During Hajj , pilgrims join processions of hundreds of thousands of people , who simultaneously converge on Mecca for the week of the Hajj , and perform a series of rituals : each person walks counter @-@ clockwise seven times around the Ka 'aba ( the cube @-@ shaped building and the direction of prayer for the Muslims ) , runs back and forth between the hills of Al @-@ Safa and Al @-@ Marwah , drinks from the <unk> Well , goes to the plains of Mount Arafat to stand in vigil , spends a night in the plain of <unk> , and performs symbolic stoning of the devil by throwing stones at three pillars . The pilgrims then shave their heads , perform a ritual of animal sacrifice , and celebrate the three @-@ day global festival of Eid al @-@ Adha . 
 Pilgrims can also go to Mecca to perform the rituals at other times of the year . This is sometimes called the " lesser pilgrimage " , or Umrah . However , even if they choose to perform the Umrah , they are still obligated to perform the Hajj at some other point in their lifetime if they have the means to do so .

 The present pattern of Hajj was established by Muhammad . However , according to the Quran , elements of Hajj trace back to the time of Abraham , around 2000 BCE . According to Islamic tradition , Abraham was ordered by God to leave his wife Hagar ( Hagar ) and his son Ishmael alone in the desert of ancient Mecca . In search of water , Hagar desperately ran seven times between the two hills of Safa and Marwah but found none . Returning in despair to Ishmael , she saw the baby scratching the ground with his leg and a water fountain sprang forth underneath his foot . Later , Abraham was commanded to build the Kaaba ( which he did with the help of Ishmael ) and to invite people to perform pilgrimage there . The Quran refers to these incidents in verses 2 : 124 @-@ 127 and 22 : 27 @-@ 30 . It is said that the archangel Gabriel brought the Black Stone from Heaven to be attached to the Kaaba . 
 In pre @-@ Islamic Arabia , a time known as <unk> , the Kaaba became surrounded by pagan idols . In 630 CE , Muhammad led his followers from Medina to Mecca , cleansed the Kaaba by destroying all the pagan idols , and then reconsecrated the building to Allah . In 632 CE , Muhammad performed his only and last pilgrimage with a large number of followers , and instructed them on the rites of Hajj . It was from this point that Hajj became one of the five pillars of Islam . 
 During the medieval times , pilgrims would gather in big cities of Syria , Egypt , and Iraq to go to Mecca in groups and caravans comprising tens of thousands of pilgrims , often under state patronage . Hajj caravans , particularly with the advent of the Mamluk Sultanate and its successor , the Ottoman Empire , were escorted by a military force accompanied by physicians under the command of an amir al @-@ hajj . This was done in order to protect the caravan from Bedouin robbers or natural hazards , and to ensure that the pilgrims were supplied with the necessary provisions . Muslim travelers like Ibn Jubayr and Ibn Battuta have recorded detailed accounts of Hajj @-@ travels of medieval time . The caravans followed well @-@ established routes called in Arabic <unk> al @-@ hajj , lit . " pilgrimage road " , which usually followed ancient routes such as the King 's Highway . 
 = = Timing of Hajj = = 
 The date of Hajj is determined by the Islamic calendar ( known as Hijri calendar or AH ) , which is based on the lunar year . Every year , the events of Hajj take place in a five @-@ day period , starting on 8 and ending on 12 Dhul @-@ Hijjah , the twelfth and last month of the Islamic calendar . Among these five days , the 9th Dhul @-@ Hijjah is known as Day of <unk> , and this day is called the day of Hajj . Because the Islamic calendar is lunar and the Islamic year is about eleven days shorter than the Gregorian year , the Gregorian date for Hajj changes from year to year . Thus , each year in the Gregorian calendar , the pilgrimage starts eleven days ( sometimes ten days ) earlier than the preceding year . This makes it possible for the Hajj season to fall twice in one Gregorian year , and it does so every 33 years . The last time this phenomenon occurred was 2006 . The table below shows the Gregorian dates of Hajj of recent years ( the dates correspond to 9 Dhul @-@ Hijjah of Hijri calendar ) : 
 The approximate date for the next Hajj pilgrimage ( 1437 AH ) is 11 September 2016 . 
 = = Rites = = 
 Fiqh literature describes in detail the manners of carrying out the rites of Hajj , and pilgrims generally follow handbooks and expert guides to successfully fulfill the requirements of Hajj . In performing the rites of hajj , the pilgrims not only follow the model of Muhammad , but also commemorate the events associated with Abraham . 
 = = = Ihram = = = 
 When the pilgrims reach the appropriate <unk> ( depending on where they 're coming from ) , they enter into a state of holiness – known as Ihram – that consists of wearing two white seamless cloths for the male , with the one wrapped around the waist reaching below the knee and the other draped over the left shoulder and tied at the right side ; wearing ordinary dress for the female that fulfills the Islamic condition of public dress with hands or face uncovered ; taking ablution ; declaring the intention ( <unk> ) to perform pilgrimage and to refraining from certain activities such as clipping the nails , shaving any part of the body , having sexual relations ; using perfumes , damaging plants , killing animals , covering head ( for men ) or the face and hands ( for women ) ; getting married ; or carrying weapons . The ihram is meant to show equality of all pilgrims in front of God : there is no difference between the rich and the poor . 
 = = = Tawaf and sa 'ay = = = 
 The ritual of Tawaf involves walking seven times counterclockwise around the Kaaba . Upon arriving at Masjid al @-@ Haram , pilgrims perform an arrival tawaf either as part of Umrah or as a welcome tawaf . During tawaf , pilgrims also include <unk> – an area at the north side of the Kaaba – inside their path . Each circuit starts with the kissing or touching of the Black Stone ( Hajar al- Aswad ) . If kissing the stone is not possible because of the crowds , they may simply point towards the stone with their hand on each circuit . Eating is not permitted but the drinking of water is allowed , because of the risk of dehydration . Men are encouraged to perform the first three circuits at a hurried pace , known as <unk> , and the following four at a more leisurely pace . 
 The completion of Tawaf is followed by two <unk> prayers at the Place of Abraham ( <unk> Ibrahim ) , a site near the Kaaba inside the mosque . However , again because of large crowds during the days of Hajj , they may instead pray anywhere in the mosque . After prayer , pilgrims also drink water from the <unk> well , which is made available in coolers throughout the Mosque . 
 Although the circuits around the Kaaba are traditionally done on the ground level , tawaf is now also performed on the first floor and roof of the mosque because of the large crowds . 
 Tawaf is followed by sa 'ay , running or walking seven times between the hills of Safa and Marwah , located near the Kaaba . Previously in open air , the place is now entirely enclosed by the Masjid al @-@ Haram mosque , and can be accessed via air @-@ conditioned tunnels . Pilgrims are advised to walk the circuit , though two green pillars mark a short section of the path where they run . There is also an internal " express lane " for the disabled . After <unk> , the male pilgrims shave their heads and women generally clip a portion of their hair , which completes the Umrah . 
 = = = First day of Hajj : 8th Dhu al @-@ Hijjah = = = 
 On the 8th Dhu al @-@ Hijjah , the pilgrims are reminded of their duties . They again don the ihram garments and confirm their intention to make the pilgrimage . The prohibitions of ihram start now . 
 = = = = Mina = = = = 
 After the morning prayer on the 8th of Dhu al @-@ Hijjah , the pilgrims proceed to Mina where they spend the whole day and offer noon , afternoon , evening , and night prayers . The next morning after morning prayer , they leave Mina to go to Arafat . 
 = = = Second day : 9th Dhu al @-@ Hijjah = = = 
 = = = = Arafat = = = = 
 On 9th Dhu al @-@ Hijjah before noon , pilgrims arrive at Arafat , a barren and plain land some 20 kilometers east of Mecca , where they stand in contemplative vigil : they offer supplications , repent on and atone for their past sins , and seek mercy of God , and listen to sermon from the Islamic scholars who deliver it from near Jabal al @-@ Rahmah ( The Mount of Mercy ) from where Muhammad is said to have delivered his last sermon . Lasting from noon through sunset , this is known as ' standing before God ' ( <unk> ) , one of the most significant rites of Hajj . At Masjid al @-@ <unk> , pilgrims offer noon and afternoon prayers together at noon time . A pilgrim 's Hajj is considered invalid if they do not spend the afternoon on Arafat . 
 = = = = Muzdalifah = = = = 
 Pilgrims must leave Arafat for Muzdalifah after sunset without praying maghrib ( evening ) prayer at Arafat . Muzdalifah is an area between Arafat and Mina . Upon reaching there , pilgrims perform Maghrib and Isha prayer jointly , spend the night praying and sleeping on the ground with open sky , and gather pebbles for the next day 's ritual of the stoning of the Devil ( Shaitan ) . 
 = = = Third day : 10th Dhu al @-@ Hijjah = = = 
 After returning from Muzdalifah , the Pilgrims spend the night at Mina . 
 = = = = Ramy al @-@ <unk> = = = = 
 Back at Mina , the pilgrims perform symbolic stoning of the devil ( Ramy al @-@ <unk> ) by throwing seven stones at only the largest of the three pillars , known as <unk> al @-@ Aqabah from sunrise to sunset . The remaining two pillars ( <unk> ) are not stoned on this day . These pillars are said to represent Satan . Pilgrims climb ramps to the multi @-@ levelled <unk> Bridge , from which they can throw their pebbles at the <unk> . Because of safety reasons , in 2004 the pillars were replaced by long walls , with catch basins below to collect the pebbles . 
 = = = = Animal sacrifice = = = = 
 After the casting of stones , animals are slaughtered to commemorate the story of Abraham and Ishmael . Traditionally the pilgrims slaughtered the animal themselves , or oversaw the slaughtering . Today many pilgrims buy a sacrifice voucher in Mecca before the greater Hajj begins , which allows an animal to be slaughtered in their name on the 10th , without the pilgrim being physically present . Modern <unk> complete the processing of the meat , which is then sent as charity to poor people around the world . At the same time as the sacrifices occur at Mecca , Muslims worldwide perform similar sacrifices , in a three @-@ day global festival called Eid al @-@ Adha . 
 = = = = Hair removal = = = = 
 After sacrificing an animal , another important rite of Hajj is shaving head or trimming hair ( known as <unk> ) . All male pilgrims shave their head or trim their hair on the day of Eid al Adha and women pilgrims cut the tips of their hair . 
 = = = = Tawaf Al @-@ <unk> = = = = 
 On the same or the following day , the pilgrims re @-@ visit the Masjid al @-@ Haram mosque in Mecca for another tawaf , known as Tawaf al @-@ <unk> , an essential part of Hajj . It symbolizes being in a hurry to respond to God and show love for Him , an obligatory part of the Hajj . The night of the 10th is spent back at Mina . 
 = = = Fourth day : 11th Dhu al @-@ Hijjah = = = 
 Starting from noon to sunset on the 11 Dhu al @-@ Hijjah ( and again the following day ) , the pilgrims again throw seven pebbles at each of the three pillars in Mina . This is commonly known as the " Stoning of the Devil " . 
 = = = Fifth day : 12th Dhu al @-@ Hijjah = = = 
 On 12 Dhu al @-@ Hijjah , the same process of stoning of the pillars as of 11 Dhu al @-@ Hijjah takes place . Pilgrims may leave Mina for Mecca before sunset on the 12th . 
 = = = Last day at Mina : 13th Dhu al @-@ Hijjah = = = 
 If unable to leave on the 12th before sunset or opt to stay at free will , they must perform the stoning ritual again on the 13th before returning to Mecca . 
 = = = = Tawaf al @-@ Wadaa = = = = 
 Finally , before leaving Mecca , pilgrims perform a farewell tawaf called the Tawaf al @-@ Wadaa . ' Wadaa ' means ' to bid farewell ' . The pilgrims circle the Kaaba seven times counter @-@ clockwise , and if they can , attempt to touch or kiss the Kaaba . 
 = = = Journey to Medina = = = 
 Though not a part of Hajj , pilgrims may choose to travel to the city of Medina and the Al @-@ Masjid an @-@ Nabawi ( Mosque of the Prophet ) , which contains Muhammad 's tomb . The <unk> Mosque and Masjid al @-@ Qiblatayn are also usually visited . 
 = = Arrangement and facilities = = 
 Making necessary arrangements each year for the growing number of pilgrims poses a logistic challenge for the government of Saudi Arabia , which has , since the 1950s , spent more than $ 100 billion to increase pilgrimage facilities . Major issues like housing , transportation , sanitation , and health care have been addressed and improved greatly by the government by introducing various development programs , with the result that pilgrims now enjoy modern facilities and perform various rites at ease . The Saudi government often sets quota for various countries to keep the pilgrims ' number at a manageable level , and arranges huge security forces and CCTV cameras to maintain overall safety during Hajj . Various institutions and government programs , such as the Haj subsidy offered in India or the <unk> Haji based in Malaysia assist pilgrims in covering the costs of the journey . For 2014 Hajj , special Hajj information desks were set up at Pakistani airports to assist the pilgrims . 
 = = Transportation = = 
 Pilgrims generally travel to Hajj in groups . During the early 19th century , numbers undertaking the traditional overland pilgrimage within caravans began to diminish as many pilgrims began arriving in Mecca by steamship . This continued for some time , until air travel came to predominate ; Egypt introduced the first airline service for Hajj pilgrims in 1937 . Today , many airlines and travel agents offer Hajj packages , and arrange for transportation and accommodation for the pilgrims . King Abdulaziz International Airport in Jeddah and Prince Mohammad Bin Abdulaziz Airport in Medina have dedicated pilgrim terminals to assist the arrival of pilgrims . Other international airports around the world , such as Indira Gandhi in New Delhi , Rajiv Gandhi International Airport in Hyderabad , Jinnah in Karachi and Soekarno @-@ Hatta in Jakarta also have dedicated terminals or temporary facilities to service pilgrims as they depart and return home . During Hajj , many airlines run extra flights to accommodate the large number of pilgrims . 
 = = Modern crowd @-@ control problems = = 
 Pilgrim numbers have greatly increased in recent years , which has led to numerous accidents and deaths due to overcrowding . The first major accident during Hajj in modern times occurred in 1990 , when a tunnel stampede led to the death of 1 @,@ 462 people . Afterwards , various crowd @-@ control techniques were adopted to ensure safety . Because of large crowds , some of the rituals have become more symbolic . For example , it is no longer necessary to kiss the Black Stone . Instead , pilgrims simply point at it on each circuit around the Kaaba . Also , the large pillars used for pebble throwing were changed into long walls in 2004 with basins below to catch the stones . Another example is that animal sacrifice is now done by appropriate Saudi authority at appointed slaughterhouses without the pilgrims being present there . 
 Even with these crowd control techniques , there are still many incidents during the Hajj as pilgrims are trampled or ramps collapse under the weight of the many visitors . During 2015 Hajj , a stampede resulted in 769 deaths and injuries to 934 others , according to the Saudi authorities . A report from Associated Press totalled at least 1470 fatalities from official reports from other countries , making it the most deadly such episode to date . Concerns were raised in 2013 and 2014 about the spread of MERS because of mass gatherings during the Hajj . Saudi Health Minister Abdullah Al @-@ <unk> said authorities have detected no cases of MERS among the pilgrims so far . He also said that , despite few cases of MERS , Saudi Arabia was ready for the 2014 pilgrimage . 
 = = Significance = = 
 To the Muslims , Hajj is associated with religious as well as social significance . Apart from being an obligatory religious duty , Hajj is seen to have a spiritual merit that provides the Muslims with an opportunity of self @-@ renewal . Hajj serves as a reminder of the Day of Judgment when Muslims believe people will stand before God . Hadith literature ( sayings of Muhammad ) articulates various merits a pilgrim achieves upon successful completion of their Hajj . After successful pilgrimage , pilgrims can prefix their names with the title ' Al @-@ Hajji ' , and are held with respect in Muslim society . However , Islamic scholars suggest Hajj should signify a Muslim 's religious commitment , and should not be a measurement of their social status . Hajj brings together and unites the Muslims from different parts of the world irrespective of their race , colour , and culture , which acts as a symbol of equality . 
 A 2008 study on the impact of participating in the Islamic pilgrimage found that Muslim communities become more positive and tolerant after Hajj experience . Titled Estimating the Impact of the Hajj : Religion and Tolerance in Islam 's Global Gathering and conducted in conjunction with Harvard University 's John F. Kennedy School of Government , the study noted that the Hajj " increases belief in equality and harmony among ethnic groups and Islamic sects and leads to more favorable attitudes toward women , including greater acceptance of female education and employment " and that " <unk> show increased belief in peace , and in equality and harmony among adherents of different religions . " 
 Malcolm X , an American civil rights activist , describes the sociological atmosphere he experienced at his Hajj in the 1960s as follows : 
 There were tens of thousands of pilgrims , from all over the world . They were of all colors , from blue @-@ eyed blondes to black @-@ skinned Africans . But we were all participating in the same ritual , displaying a spirit of unity and brotherhood that my experiences in America had led me to believe never could exist between the white and the non @-@ white . America needs to understand Islam , because this is the one religion that erases from its society the race problem . You may be shocked by these words coming from me . But on this pilgrimage , what I have seen , and experienced , has forced me to rearrange much of my thought patterns previously held . 
 = = Number of pilgrims per year = = 
 There has been a substantial increase in the number of pilgrims during the last 92 years , and the number of foreign pilgrims has increased by approximately 2 @,@ 824 percent , from 58 @,@ 584 in 1920 to 1 @,@ 712 @,@ 962 in 2012 . Because of development and expansion work at Masjid al @-@ Haram , the authority restricted the number of pilgrims in 2013 .

 = Patrice Evra = 
 Patrice <unk> Evra ( French pronunciation : ​ [ <unk> <unk> ] ; born 15 May 1981 ) is a French international footballer who plays for Italian club Juventus . Originally an attacker , he primarily plays as a left @-@ back . Evra , whom Sir Alex Ferguson praised for his leadership , also describing him as one of the best left @-@ backs in Europe , has served as captain for both Manchester United and France . 
 The son of a diplomat , Evra was born in Senegal and arrived in Europe when he was a year old . He was raised in France and began his football career playing for various clubs in the Île @-@ de @-@ France region such as hometown club CO Les Ulis and CSF Brétigny . In 1997 , he had a stint at professional club Paris Saint @-@ Germain . A year later , Evra seized his first footballing opportunity in neighbouring Italy when he signed his first professional contract with Marsala in Sicily . He made his professional debut with the club and , in the ensuing season , joined Monza . After a year playing with Monza , Evra returned to France to play for Nice . Originally a midfielder , while playing at Nice , he was converted into a full @-@ back . In 2002 , Evra moved to AS Monaco and contributed to the team that won the Coupe de la Ligue in 2003 . He also featured in European competition for the first time in his career and , in the 2003 – 04 season , was the starting left @-@ back on the Monaco team that reached the 2004 UEFA Champions League Final . In that same season domestically , Evra was named the National Union of Professional Footballers ( UNFP ) Ligue 1 Young Player of the Year . He was also named to the organisation 's Ligue 1 Team of the Year . 
 Evra 's performances with Monaco culminated into a move to English club Manchester United in January 2006 . While playing for Manchester United , Evra won a slew of trophies , which included winning the Football League Cup in his debut season at the club . In his second season , he eclipsed compatriot Mikaël Silvestre and Gabriel Heinze as first @-@ choice left @-@ back and has since won five Premier League titles , one UEFA Champions League title , one FIFA Club World Cup , three League Cups , and four Community Shield titles . Evra has been named to the Professional Footballers ' Association ( PFA ) Team of the Year on three occasions . For his performances during the 2008 – 09 season , he was named to both the FIFPro World XI and the UEFA Team of the Year . After joining Italian side Juventus in 2014 , he immediately helped the club to a domestic double and the 2015 UEFA Champions League Final , and won a second domestic double and the Supercoppa Italiana the following season . 
 Evra is also a France international . Prior to playing at senior level , he played at under @-@ 21 level . He made his senior international debut in August 2004 in a friendly match against Bosnia and Herzegovina . Evra has participated in five major international tournaments for France ; the 2008 , 2012 and 2016 editions of the UEFA European Football Championship , winning a runners @-@ up medal at Euro 2016 , and both the 2010 FIFA World Cup and 2014 FIFA World Cup . Ahead of the 2010 World Cup , Evra was named captain of the national team by Domenech and bore the armband for the first time in the team 's friendly match against Costa Rica in May 2010 . At the tournament , he appeared in two group stage matches , although France endured a disastrous campaign which saw the players go on strike . The incident resulted in Evra , for his role as captain , being suspended from national team duty for five matches . However , he returned to the squad and enjoyed a successful 2014 World Cup in Brazil under Didier Deschamps , as France reached the quarter @-@ finals .

 = = = Early career = = = 
 Evra began his football career playing for hometown club CO Les Ulis . After playing in the streets for years , he was brought to the club by friend <unk> <unk> who informed the club coach " I bring you the new Romário " . Evra spent a year at the club under the watch of coach Jean @-@ Claude <unk> , who later became vice @-@ president of the club . <unk> described the player as " more quiet , almost shy . He was a good kid " . Evra originally played football in the striker position and , while training at Les Ulis , underwent trials with professional clubs Rennes and Lens . Following the conclusion of the evaluations , Evra was rejected primarily due to his size . In 1993 , he joined amateur club CSF Brétigny based in nearby Brétigny @-@ sur @-@ Orge . Similar to his stint with Les Ulis , Evra went on trials with several clubs , most notably Toulouse and Paris Saint @-@ Germain . He was ultimately signed by the latter club and converted into a winger . Evra trained at the Camp des Loges for a few months , but was later released . 
 After failing to convince Paris Saint @-@ Germain officials of his ability as a footballer , Evra returned to Brétigny and was invited by a friend to participate in an indoor five @-@ a @-@ side football tournament organised by the <unk> @-@ sur @-@ Orge sports center . While playing , he was spotted by an Italian scout who offered him the opportunity to attend a trial with professional club Torino in Italy . Evra spent ten days training with the club and , after the trial , was offered a place on the club 's youth team . Afterwards , he was approached by Serie C1 club Marsala whose officials enticed him with the prospect of becoming a professional . Evra chose the latter option and signed his first professional contract at the age of 17 . He described the moment as " the best feeling I have had in football " . Evra spent only one season with the club appearing in 27 total matches and scoring six goals . After this , he moved to the Serie B level to join Monza for a fee of € 250 @,@ 000 after potential moves to Serie A clubs Roma and Lazio came to nothing . Evra only appeared in three matches , making his debut on 29 August 1999 in a 2 – 1 away defeat against <unk> . He left the club following one season after becoming frustrated due to his lack of appearances . 
 = = = Nice = = = 
 Evra returned to France joining professional club Nice in Ligue 2 , the second division of French football . He spent the majority of his first season with the club playing with its reserve team in the Championnat de France amateur , the fourth level of French football . He primarily played as a midfielder on the team and appeared in 18 matches , converting one goal . Midway through the campaign , Evra was called into the first team by manager Sandro Salvioni . He was assigned the number 26 shirt and made his club debut on 7 October 2000 in the team 's 7 – 2 defeat to Châteauroux starting in the left winger position . Evra made four more appearances during the campaign appearing as a substitute in defeats to Cannes , Nancy , and starting in the team 's 3 – 0 win over Laval and 1 – 0 loss to Le Havre on the final match day of the season . Evra played primarily as centre forward in the matches . 
 In the 2001 – 02 season , Evra switched to the number 17 shirt and was promoted to the first team on a permanent basis . In the team 's first league match of the season against Laval , he started in the team 's 2 – 1 win . Towards the end of the match , reserve left @-@ back Jean @-@ Charles <unk> , who was starting in place of the regular starter José Cobos , suffered an injury , which required the player to be substituted out . As a consequence , Evra dropped back into the role and played out the rest of the match in the position . Following the match , due to injuries to both Cobos and <unk> , Evra was informed by Salvioni that he would take over the position . The young player disagreed with the manager 's decision declaring that he was a forward , however , after Salvioni informed him " If you want to be in the team you play there " , Evra agreed to take on the role . Evra made his debut in the position in the team 's following league match against Strasbourg ; a 3 – 0 defeat . He appeared regularly in the campaign and , following the return of Cobos , was even allowed to play in his preferred left wing role . With the club in the midst of a promotion battle , Evra scored his first and only goal for Nice in his last match with the club , a 4 – 3 win over Laval . The victory placed Nice in third place , which resulted in the club earning promotion to Ligue 1 for the first time since 1997 . For his performances , Evra was named to the National Union of Professional Footballers ( UNFP ) Ligue 2 Team of the Year in the left @-@ back position . 
 = = = AS Monaco = = = 
 Following the season , Evra was recruited by Nice 's Derby de la Côte d 'Azur rivals AS Monaco . Despite wanting to play as a left winger again , Evra was advised by manager Didier Deschamps that he would only play as a left @-@ back . Evra has since credited Deschamps for allowing him to become a better defender after initially describing the role as being not fun . Evra was inserted into a back four that consisted of centre @-@ backs Rafael Márquez and Sébastien Squillaci and right @-@ back Franck <unk> . Evra was assigned the number 3 shirt and made his debut for the club in the opening match of the 2002 – 03 season against Troyes . He played the entire match in a 4 – 0 win . On 28 September , Evra scored his first goal for the club netting the game @-@ winning goal in a 2 – 1 victory against Rennes . On 22 March 2003 , he scored his second goal of the season in a 3 – 0 away win over Le Havre . The victory allowed Monaco to maintain its position at the top of the table as the club was in a three @-@ way battle with Lyon and Marseille . Monaco climatically conceded first place to Lyon in May , which resulted in Lyon being declared champions for the first time in its history . Monaco finished the campaign in second place , which merited the club an appearance in the UEFA Champions League . The club was also rewarded domestically for its performance in the Coupe de la Ligue where it reached the final . Evra featured in the team 's 4 – 1 win over Sochaux in the match . The league cup title gave Evra the first major honour of his career . 
 After the season , Marquez and <unk> departed Monaco for Spanish club Barcelona and Bordeaux respectively , and were replaced by Gaël Givet and Hugo Ibarra , the latter joining the club on loan . In the 2003 – 04 league season , Deschamps installed Evra as a vice @-@ captain and he responded by appearing in 33 matches and providing four assists . Monaco spent six months from September to March in first place , but , like last season , conceded the top spot to Lyon as the season wore on . Evra made his UEFA Champions League debut on 17 September 2003 in the team 's opening group stage match against Dutch club PSV . Evra played the entire match in a 2 – 1 win . He appeared in all six group stage matches as Monaco finished in first place . For his performances in the first half of the 2003 – 04 season , Evra was linked with a 2004 winter move to English club Arsenal , Italian clubs Juventus and Milan , and Spanish club Barcelona . 
 After appearing consistently with the team , on 24 March 2004 , Evra suffered an ankle injury in the team 's 4 – 2 first leg defeat to Spanish club Real Madrid in the quarter @-@ finals of the Champions League . Evra subsequently missed two weeks in the league , but was healthy enough to return for the team 's second leg quarter @-@ final tie against Madrid , which Monaco won 3 – 1 . The win allowed the club advancement to the Champions League semi @-@ finals on the away goals rule . In the semi @-@ finals , Monaco faced English club Chelsea . Evra appeared in both matches as Monaco advanced to the final , beating the London club 5 – 3 on aggregate . In the 2004 UEFA Champions League Final , Monaco were pitted against Portuguese contenders Porto at the Arena <unk> in Gelsenkirchen , Germany . The club was defeated 3 – 0 by Porto . Evra played the full 90 minutes . After the season , Evra was given the UNFP Young Player of the Year award , becoming only the second defender and the first since 1997 ( Philippe <unk> ) to win the award . He was also named to the organisation 's Ligue 1 Team of the Year . 
 Despite missing out on playing in UEFA Euro 2004 , Evra endured a tumultuous summer in which the player was linked with moves with Manchester United in England , and Juventus and Internazionale in Italy . Despite offers , Evra remained at Monaco . On 24 September 2004 , he signed a one @-@ year contract extension with the club until 2008 . In the season , Evra was a regular appearing in a career @-@ high 52 matches scoring one goal and assisting on seven as Monaco reached the semi @-@ finals in both the Coupe de la Ligue and Coupe de France . Evra scored his only goal of the season on 8 January 2005 in the team 's Round of 64 Coupe de France match against amateur club AC <unk> @-@ <unk> . He netted the opener in a 7 – 0 win . In the Champions League , Monaco reached the first knockout round where the club suffered defeat to PSV 3 – 0 on aggregate . Evra appeared in nine of the ten matches the team contested in the competition . In April 2005 , Evra confirmed that he was interested in departing the club stating " I will have a decision to make for the rest of my career [ ... ] If attracted clubs show concrete interest , I will think about it seriously " . Despite several clubs declaring interest in Evra , Deschamps declared that the player would not be sold . At the start of the 2005 – 06 season , Monaco struggled falling to 15th place after only a month of play . On 21 December 2005 , Evra made his final appearance with the club in a 1 – 0 win over Lille in the Coupe de la Ligue .

 On 27 December , French sources revealed that Manchester United was interested in signing Evra . Despite rumours of Monaco reaching a transfer agreement with Italian club Internazionale , on 3 January 2006 , Evra revealed that he preferred to move to England to join Manchester United . The following day , Manchester United officially issued a transfer bid for the player . On 6 January , Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson confirmed that a deal for Evra was done . Four days later , the transfer was official as Evra joined the club for a transfer fee of around £ 5 @.@ 5 million and put pen to paper on a three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ year contract . Evra 's arrival signalled Ferguson 's intention to shore up the club 's defence that had suffered since the sidelining of Gabriel Heinze . After joining the club , Evra affirmed that Manchester was his only future destination pronouncing " I was not very keen to go forward in the talks with Arsenal , Liverpool or Real Madrid . They all talked with my agent in the past two seasons . But to me , it was over . As I said to the Monaco officials , I only wanted to hear about Manchester " . 
 Evra initially had some problems adapting to the English game . He made his debut for the club on 14 January in a 3 – 1 away defeat to Manchester City in the Premier League . He was substituted out at half @-@ time after failing to make an impact . After the conclusion of the match , Ferguson stated , " Maybe it was a bit of a gamble playing Evra " , while the player himself admitted that " playing for Manchester United was something I was not prepared for " . Despite the initial set @-@ back , Evra started in the team 's ensuing match against Liverpool , a 1 – 0 victory , and was praised for his performance by team @-@ mate Rio Ferdinand . On 26 February , Evra appeared as a substitute in United 's 4 – 0 win over Wigan Athletic in the 2006 Football League Cup Final . On 2 March , it was reported that Liverpool defender Steve Finnan had racially abused Evra in the match . The abuse claims surfaced from two deaf television viewers lodging a police complaint . The viewers claimed to have lip @-@ read Finnan abusing Evra during the televised match . Finnan denied the charge and , after an investigation , The Football Association ( FA ) decided against charging the player . Evra regularly alternated between the bench and the starting 11 to close out the campaign . He finished the season with 14 total appearances for his new club . 
 In Evra 's first full season as a Manchester United player , he struggled to consistently appear as a starter early on in the season as Ferguson preferred Evra 's compatriot Mikaël Silvestre . After appearing as an unused substitute in United 's first two Champions League matches , on 17 October 2006 , Evra made his European debut for the club in its 3 – 0 group stage win over Danish club Copenhagen . On 18 November , he provided the assist for the game @-@ winning goal , scored by Wayne Rooney , in the team 's 2 – 1 win over Sheffield United . Eight days later , Evra scored his first goal for the club in a 3 – 0 league win over Everton . He also assisted on a goal in the match . By December , Evra began featuring as a regular in the starting 11 . After starting in United 's 3 – 1 Champions League win over Portuguese club Benfica on 6 December , Evra started nine consecutive matches . Evra provided assists in two of the matches ; a Rooney goal in a 2 – 1 away defeat to Arsenal and another in a 2 – 0 victory over Charlton Athletic . On 10 April 2007 , Evra scored the final goal in a 7 – 1 win over Roma in the second leg of the quarter @-@ finals of the 2007 – 08 UEFA Champions League . The goal was his first @-@ ever in the Champions League and helped progress Manchester United to the semi @-@ finals where the club suffered defeat to the eventual champions Milan . Following the league season , which Manchester United won by a six @-@ point margin , Evra was named to the Professional Footballers ' Association ( PFA ) Team of the Year , despite only appearing in 24 league matches . 
 Evra began the 2007 – 08 season as the first @-@ choice left @-@ back . He began the campaign appearing in United 's 3 – 0 penalty shoot @-@ out win over rivals Chelsea in the 2007 FA Community Shield . In competitive matches , Evra appeared in the club 's first 12 matches . He missed his first match of the season against Ukrainian club Dynamo Kyiv in the Champions League after suffering a calf injury during warm @-@ ups . Evra returned to the team a few days later for the team 's league match against Arsenal . The rest paid off as he assisted on a Cristiano Ronaldo goal in the 82nd minute to give United a 2 – 1 lead . France international teammate William Gallas later equalised for Arsenal to draw the match at 2 – 2 . In the return match against Dynamo Kyiv in the Champions League , Evra provided the assist for one of the goals in a 4 – 0 victory . Though he made 48 appearances in all competitions , Evra failed to score a goal . Manchester United clinched its second consecutive Premier League title on the final day , edging Chelsea by two points . The club later completed the double after defeating the same club on penalties in the 2008 UEFA Champions League Final . Evra made ten appearances in the competition , which included playing the entire 120 minutes in the final . After the season , on 12 June , he signed a four @-@ year contract extension with Manchester United , a deal that was set to keep him at Old Trafford until 2012 . 
 = = = = 2008 – 2014 = = = = 
 Prior to the start of the 2008 – 09 season , on 18 July 2008 , Evra was charged with four separate counts of improper conduct by the FA . The charges were related to an incident that occurred during the 2007 – 08 season when Evra had an altercation with a Chelsea groundsman during a warm @-@ down following a match on 26 April . The defender denied the charges and was supported by several members of the club 's staff who commented that the player was racially abused by the groundsman prior to the confrontation . Evra remained free to play for United up to the date of the hearing despite the charges being made in July 2008 . He began the campaign in similar fashion to last season as Manchester United won the Community Shield following the team 's 3 – 0 victory over Portsmouth on penalties . Evra was ever @-@ present in Manchester United 's first 22 competitive matches of the season , starting 19 of them . At the hearing on 5 December , Evra was found guilty of improper conduct , and handed a four @-@ match ban – due to start on 22 December 2008 – and a £ 15 @,@ 000 fine . 
 Despite the suspension , Evra still featured with Manchester United in December as the club participated in the 2008 FIFA Club World Cup . He appeared in both matches the team contested as United came out as champions after defeating Ecuadorian club LDU Quito in the final . Evra temporarily returned to the team domestically for its home match , coincidentally , against Chelsea on 11 January 2009 . In the match , Evra assisted on the second goal in a 3 – 0 victory . He was later forced to leave the match due to a foot injury , which was later discovered to be serious . Evra missed a month and returned to the line @-@ up on 15 February in a 3 – 0 win over Fulham . Evra subsequently appeared in every remaining competitive match for United , excluding an April league match against Sunderland , as the club cruised to its third consecutive Premier League title , won the Football League Cup , and reached the 2009 UEFA Champions League Final after defeating league rivals Arsenal 4 – 1 on aggregate in the semi @-@ finals . Following the second leg against Arsenal , Evra was asked his opinion of the team 's 3 – 1 second leg victory , and declared " It was 11 men against 11 babies . We never doubted ourselves " . The final marked Evra 's third appearance in Champions League finals as Manchester United lost 2 – 0 to Barcelona . At the end of the season , Evra was included in the PFA Team of the Year for the second time . 
 For the first time in his career , Evra appeared in all 38 league matches in the 2009 – 10 season . The campaign initially began badly for him after he delivered a soft penalty shot , described by some in the media as " awful " , in the team 's penalty shoot @-@ out defeat to Chelsea in the 2009 FA Community Shield . Due to injuries to Rio Ferdinand , Gary Neville and Ryan Giggs , he captained the team in several matches during the season wearing the armband for the first time in his Manchester United career in the team 's 3 – 1 Champions League victory over VfL Wolfsburg . In December 2009 , Evra was among three Manchester United players named to the FIFPro World XI for the 2009 calendar year , before being named to the UEFA Team of the Year in January 2010 . On 28 February 2010 , Evra captained Manchester United to a 2 – 1 win against Aston Villa in the 2010 Football League Cup Final . The league cup title was Evra 's fourth overall as well as his first title earned as a captain . He also became only the second Frenchman after Eric Cantona to captain a Manchester United team to victory in a major competition . In league play , Manchester United failed to win its fourth straight league title conceding the honour to Chelsea . The club also failed to reach the UEFA Champions League final for their third straight final appearance , losing to German champions Bayern Munich in the quarter @-@ finals . 
 Early on during the 2010 – 11 season , Evra was hampered by constant inquiries about what happened at the 2010 FIFA World Cup from the French Football Federation , the French media , as well as the French government . Evra 's contract with Manchester United was also up at the end of the 2011 – 12 season , which led to the player being linked with a move to Real Madrid . Evra 's hearing with the federation in Paris , which he attended , was held the day after the team 's opening 3 – 0 league win over Newcastle United . Evra played over 85 minutes in the match . On 20 November , Evra scored his second Premier League goal in a 2 – 0 win at home against Wigan . On 21 February 2011 , after weeks of negotiations , Evra signed a contract extension with Manchester United that would keep him with the club until at least the end of the 2013 – 14 season . Two days after signing his contract extension , Evra participated in United 's 0 – 0 draw with Marseille in the first leg of the team 's first knockout round tie in the Champions League . The match , played at the Stade Vélodrome in Marseille , was Evra 's first match played in France since the 2010 World Cup debacle . As a consequence , he was subjected to a barrage of jeers and boos every time he touched the ball . 
 At the start of the 2011 – 12 season , Evra helped United win the 2011 Community Shield against Manchester City on 7 August . Despite being caught out in the first half by a header from Joleon Lescott and a long range Edin Džeko strike that put City into a 2 – 0 lead , United rallied back in the second half and won 3 – 2 to claim the Shield . On 15 October , Evra captained Manchester United in the club 's 1 – 1 draw away to Liverpool . Following the match , in an interview with French television channel Canal + , Evra asserted that Liverpool player Luis Suárez had racially abused him multiple times during the match . He also stated that he had informed referee Andre Marriner of the incidents at the conclusion of the match . The following day , the FA announced that it would investigate the claim , and on 17 November , the FA announced it would charge Suárez with " abusive and / or insulting words and / or behaviour contrary to FA rules " , including " a reference to the ethnic origin and / or colour and / or race of Patrice Evra . " 
 During the 2012 – 13 season , despite being just 174 cm ( 5 ft 9 in ) tall , Evra built up a reputation as an attacking threat at corners , doubling his goals tally from his previous seven years at the club with three headed goals from corners in the space of 13 games , against Newcastle United , Arsenal and Swansea City . He continued this run into the 2013 – 14 season , heading home against Cardiff City on 24 November 2013 . In addition to the headers , Evra has also scored twice from open play since the start of the 2012 – 13 season , the first a low drive from just outside the penalty area against Newcastle United on Boxing Day 2012 , and the second a curling , right @-@ footed effort against Stoke City in the fifth round of the League Cup almost a year later . On 23 May 2014 , Evra signed a new one @-@ year contract extension that would have kept him at Manchester United until at least the summer of 2015 . 
 = = = Juventus = = = 
 On 21 July 2014 , Evra joined Serie A club Juventus on a two @-@ year contract . The fee was £ 1 @.@ 2 million , which rose to £ 1 @.@ 5 million , after Juventus qualified for the 2015 – 16 UEFA Champions League . On 14 December 2014 , he scored his first goal for the club , opening the scoring of a 1 – 1 home draw to Sampdoria . 
 On 6 June 2015 , Evra started for Juventus in the 2015 UEFA Champions League Final as Juventus were defeated 3 – 1 by Barcelona at Berlin 's Olympiastadion ; the match was the fifth Champions League final in which he had appeared , and the defeat meant that he became the first player to lose four Champions League finals . 
 On 25 November 2015 , he made his 100th Champions League appearance in a 1 – 0 home win over Manchester City , becoming the second French player to do so after Thierry Henry . Evra scored a goal in the last match of the 2015 – 16 Serie A season on 14 May 2016 , in a 5 – 0 home win over Sampdoria , as Juventus celebrated winning the league title for a fifth consecutive time since the 2011 – 12 season . On 6 June , Evra renewed his contract with the club for a season .

 Evra is a former French youth international having played for the under @-@ 21 team .

Evra earned his first call @-@ up to the under @-@ 21 team under coach Raymond Domenech on 3 October 2002 for matches against Slovenia and Malta . He made his under @-@ 21 debut in the match against Slovenia as France cruised to a 1 – 0 victory . Evra was forced to miss the match against Malta after suffering an injury in the win over Slovenia . The defender regularly appeared for the team through 2002 – 2004 as France attempted to qualify for both the 2004 UEFA European Under @-@ 21 Football Championship and the football tournament at the 2004 Summer Olympics .

Following the trimming of the squad to 23 players , Evra was not included and subsequently missed out on the competition . Following the European Championship , with former under @-@ 21 coach Domenech now coaching the team , Evra was called up to the senior team for its friendly against Bosnia and Herzegovina on 18 August 2004 .

He started on the left wing before being substituted out in the 75th minute for Robert Pirès . The match ended in a 1 – 1 draw . Due to an injury to starter Éric Abidal , Evra supplanted him and appeared as the starting left @-@ back in France 's first two 2006 FIFA World Cup qualification matches . After being called up for the team 's March 2005 friendly against Switzerland , Evra was forced to withdraw from the team due to injury . As a result , William Gallas was inserted in the role as a makeshift left @-@ back . Following Abidal 's return from injury and , due to Domenech preferring Mikaël Silvestre as the incumbent 's back @-@ up , Evra went without a call @-@ up for almost two years and , consequently , missed the 2006 FIFA World Cup . In October 2007 , the defender explained to L 'Equipe that the World Cup snub " gave me my determination " . 
 Evra returned to the team in November 2006 for the team 's friendly match against Greece . He appeared as a half @-@ time substitute for Abidal as France won the match 1 – 0 . After going another year without representing France , Evra began appearing as a regular under Domenech in 2007 . On 28 May 2008 , he was included in the squad to participate in UEFA Euro 2008 . Evra was initially placed onto the squad to serve as back @-@ up to Abidal , however , after failing to appear in the team 's opening 0 – 0 draw with Romania , there were calls from the French media urging Domenech to insert Evra into the starting line @-@ up at the behest of Abidal . Domenech relented and started Evra in the team 's next match against the Netherlands , which was a 4 – 1 defeat . In the must @-@ win final group stage match against Italy , Evra started his second consecutive match , but France lost 2 – 0 and were eliminated from the competition . Following the match , cameras witnessed Evra and team @-@ mates Patrick Vieira and Abidal getting into an altercation in the tunnel . Vieira later stated that the video was shot after he got into an argument with a set of French supporters . A day after the team 's elimination , Evra admitted his frustration to French newspaper L 'Equipe , stating , " I am someone who does not like losing but I 'm not going to make excuses . We had three games in this Euro , we have not won one . It 's even hard to believe , to say it 's over now " .

 After Euro 2008 , defensive stalwart Lilian Thuram retired from the team ; to accommodate this , Domenech decided to move Abidal into the centre @-@ back position , which allowed Evra to take over as the starting left @-@ back . In the team 's first competitive match since Euro 2008 against Austria , Evra provided the assist for France 's only goal scored by Sidney Govou in a surprising 3 – 1 defeat . During the 2010 FIFA World Cup qualification campaign , Evra participated in ten of the team 's 12 matches , which included both legs in the team 's playoff round win over the Republic of Ireland . On 26 May 2010 , Evra captained the national team for the first time in a friendly match against Costa Rica ; France won the match 2 – 1 . He was subsequently named the captain for the 2010 FIFA World Cup ahead of Thierry Henry , who was relegated to the bench for the tournament . Evra wore the armband in the team 's first two matches , a 0 – 0 draw with Uruguay and a 2 – 0 loss to Mexico . On 19 June , striker Nicolas Anelka was dismissed from the squad after reportedly having a dispute , in which obscenities were passed , with Domenech during half @-@ time of the team 's loss to Mexico . The resulting disagreement over Anelka 's exclusion between the players , the coaching staff , and federation officials resulted in Evra leading a player protest against the decision on 20 June , in which the players refused to train . Prior to leading the revolt , Evra had got into a verbal argument with national team fitness coach Robert <unk> . The strike was denounced by the French Football Federation , as well as government officials . The following day , the players returned to training without incident . As a result of the mutiny , Evra was stripped of the captaincy and benched for the team 's final group stage match against hosts South Africa . France lost 2 – 1 and were knocked out of the competition . 
 Following the competition , former national team captain Lilian Thuram stated that Evra should be banned permanently from playing for the national team . His sentiments were later echoed by sports minister Chantal <unk> who declared " I have nothing against Evra but , as a France player and especially captain , he did not defend the values of sport which are shared by the Republic . I am sure there exist other talents who have not sullied France and are waiting for the chance to write new history " . On 6 August , Evra was one of five players summoned to attend a hearing held by the Disciplinary Committee of the French Football Federation in response to the team 's strike held at the World Cup . On 17 August , he received a five @-@ match international ban for his part in the incident .

 As a result of being captain , Evra bore the brunt of the criticism ; however , despite the public ridicule , Evra maintained his stance regarding his future with the national team stating " I can ’ t see my future without the France team " . On 17 March 2011 , he was called up to the national team by new manager Laurent Blanc for the first time since the 2010 FIFA World Cup . He had been eligible to return to the team since the previous month after serving his five @-@ match suspension , however , he was not called up to the team by Blanc with the manager citing sporting reasons as being why .

 = Harry Randall Truman = 
 Harry Randall Truman ( October 30 , 1896 – May 18 , 1980 ) was a resident of the U.S. state of Washington who lived on Mount St. Helens . He came to brief fame in the months preceding the volcano 's 1980 eruption after he stubbornly refused to leave his home despite evacuation orders , and he is presumed to have been killed in the eruption . He was the owner and caretaker of Mount St. Helens Lodge at Spirit Lake , located at the south end of Spirit Lake at the foot of the mountain in the danger zone at the time of the eruption . 
 After Truman 's death , his family and friends reflected on his love for the mountain . He was commemorated in a book by his niece and a song by Headgear . In 1981 , Art Carney portrayed Truman in the docu @-@ drama film St. Helens . 
 = = Life = = 
 Truman was born in <unk> , Clay County , West Virginia , to Rosa Belle ( née Hardman ; 1873 – 1957 ) and Newberry Truman ( 1874 – 1923 ) . His family settled in Chehalis , Washington several years later , where his father died in a logging camp accident in 1923 , aged 49 . He had one sister , Geraldine ( 1905 – 1987 ) . 
 Truman enlisted in the 100th Aero Squadron – 7th Squad of United States Army as a private on August 4 , 1917 . Several months later , he survived the torpedoing of the Tuscania on February 5 , 1918 , off the coast of Ireland . After the incident , Truman was honorably discharged from military service on June 12 , 1919 . He lived in Riffe , Washington , until 1926 , when he became caretaker of the Mount St. Helens Lodge at the foot of Mount St. Helens beside Spirit Lake . In 1928 Truman bought a half interest in the lodge , later that same year he bought the other half . At the time of his death , Truman had operated the lodge for 52 years . He was also a member of the Tuscania Survivors Association from 1938 until his death . 
 Truman was married three times : to Helen Irene ( née Hughes ) , Marjorie ( née Bennett ) , and Edna O. ( née Henrickson ) . It is not clear when he married or separated from Hughes , but he married Bennett in 1935 and Henrickson in 1947 .

 He became a minor celebrity during the two months of volcanic activity preceding the eruption , giving interviews to reporters and expressing his opinion that the danger from the volcano was exaggerated , saying , " I don 't have any idea whether it will blow [ ... ] But I don 't believe it to the point that I 'm going to pack up . " Truman discarded all of his concerns about the volcano and his situation , stating " If the mountain goes , I 'm going with it . This area is heavily timbered , Spirit Lake is in between me and the mountain , and the mountain is a mile away , the mountain ain 't gonna hurt me ... boy . " According to The Bulletin , he responded to being knocked from his bed by precursor earthquakes by moving his mattress to his basement . At one point , Truman " scoffed " at the public 's concern for his safety . He became something of a " folk hero " and from March until May , was the subject of many songs and poems by children . One group of children from Salem , Oregon , sent him banners inscribed " Harry - We Love You " , while Truman received fan letters including several marriage proposals . 
 = = Death = = 
 Truman was alone at his lodge when he is presumed to have died in the eruption on May 18 . A pyroclastic flow engulfed the Spirit Lake area , destroying the lake and burying the site of his lodge under 150 feet ( 46 m ) of volcanic landslide debris . A new lake eventually formed on a much higher elevation . 
 His sister Geraldine expressed that she found it hard to accept the reality of his death , commenting , " I don 't think he made it . But I thought if they would let me fly over and see for myself that Harry 's lodge is gone , then maybe I 'd believe it for sure . " 
 The 1980 event was the deadliest and most destructive volcanic eruption in the recorded history of the continental United States of America . A total of 57 people are known to have died , and more were left homeless when the ash falls and pyroclastic flows destroyed or buried 200 houses . In addition to Truman , photojournalist Reid Blackburn , volcanologist David A. Johnston and photographer Robert Landsburg were killed . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Truman had already emerged as a " folk hero " for his resistance to the evacuation efforts prior to his death . After his death , his friends and family , including his sister , Geraldine ( Geri ) , reflected on his death . Geri commented , " He was a very opinionated person . " Friend John Garrity added , " The mountain and the lake were his life . If he 'd left and then saw what the mountain did to his lake , it would have killed him anyway . He always said he wanted to die at Spirit Lake . He went the way he wanted to go . " Another friend , John Andersen , said , " Harry 's name and Harry 's presence will always be a part of that ( Spirit Lake ) . There can be no finer memorial . " Truman 's cousin Richard Ice commented that Truman " was not only a fast talker but loud . He had an opinion on all subjects and a definite one . " Ice also added that Truman 's short period of life as a celebrity was " the peak of his life . " 
 Truman was the subject of the book Truman of St. Helens : The Man and His Mountain written by his niece Shirley Rosen and was portrayed by Art Carney in the 1981 docu @-@ drama film St. Helens . He is the subject of the song " Harry Truman " written and recorded by Irish band Headgear , which features the refrain , " You can move the mountain but I 'm never coming down " . Another song about Harry was written by Lula Belle Garland called " The Legend of Harry And The Mountain . " It was recorded in 1980 by Ron Shaw & The Desert Wind Band . 
 More recently , singer @-@ songwriter and family entertainer Billy Jonas included Truman 's story in his song " Old St. Helen " , recorded in 2002 .

 The Spanish American wars of independence were the numerous wars against Spanish rule in Spanish America that took place during the early 19th century , after the French invasion of Spain during Europe 's Napoleonic Wars . These conflicts started in 1809 with short @-@ lived governing juntas established in Chuquisaca and Quito opposing the composition of the Supreme Central Junta of Seville . When the Central Junta fell to the French invasion , in 1810 , numerous new juntas appeared across the Spanish domains in the Americas . The conflicts among these colonies and with Spain eventually resulted in a chain of newly independent countries stretching from Argentina and Chile in the south to Mexico in the north in the first third of the 19th century . Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under Spanish rule until the Spanish – American War in 1898 . 
 The new republics from the beginning abolished the casta system , the Inquisition and nobility , and slavery was ended in all of the new nations within a quarter century . Criollos ( those of Spanish descent born in the New World ) and mestizos ( those of mixed Indian and Spanish blood ) replaced Spanish @-@ born appointees in most political offices . Criollos remained at the top of a social structure which retained some of its traditional features culturally , if not legally . For almost a century thereafter , conservatives and liberals fought to reverse or to deepen the social and political changes unleashed by those rebellions . 
 These conflicts were fought as irregular warfare and conventional warfare , and both wars of national liberation and civil wars , since on the one hand the goal of one group of belligerents was the independence of the Spanish colonies , and on the other the majority of combatants on both sides were Spanish Americans and indigenous people , not Spaniards . Both armies originated from Spanish colonial troops of Americas . While some Spanish Americans believed that independence was necessary , most who initially supported the creation of the new governments saw them as a mean to preserve the region 's autonomy from the French . Over the course of the next decade , the political instability in Spain and the absolutist restoration under Ferdinand VII convinced more and more Spanish Americans of the need to formally establish independence from the mother country . 
 The events in Spanish America were related to the other wars of independence in Haiti and Brazil . Brazil 's independence , in particular , shared a common starting point with Spanish America 's , since both conflicts were triggered by Napoleon 's invasion of the Iberian Peninsula , which forced the Portuguese royal family to resettle in Brazil in 1807 . The process of Latin American independence took place in the general political and intellectual climate that emerged from the Age of Enlightenment and that influenced all of the Atlantic Revolutions , including the earlier revolutions in the United States and France . A more direct cause of the Spanish American wars of independence were the unique developments occurring within the Kingdom of Spain and its monarchy during this period . 
 = = Historical background = = 
 Several factors set the stage for wars of independence . First the Bourbon Reforms of the mid @-@ eighteenth century introduced changes to the relationship of Spanish Americans to the Crown . In an effort to better control the administration and economy of the overseas possessions the Crown reintroduced the practice of appointing outsiders , almost all peninsulars , to the various royal offices throughout the empire . This meant that Spanish Americans lost the gains they had made in holding local offices as a result of the sale of offices during the previous century and a half . In some areas — such as Cuba , Río de la Plata and New Spain — the reforms had positive effects , improving the local economy and the efficiency of the government . 
 In other areas , the changes in crown 's economic and administrative policies led to tensions with locals , which at times erupted into open revolts , such as the Revolt of the Comuneros in New Granada and the Rebellion of Túpac Amaru II in Peru . Neither of these two eighteenth @-@ century developments — the loss of high offices to Criollos and the revolts — were the direct causes of the wars of independence , which took place decades later , but they were important elements of the political background in which the wars took place . 
 Other factors included Enlightenment thinking and the examples of the Atlantic Revolutions . The Enlightenment spurred the desire for social and economic reform to spread throughout Latin America and the Iberian Peninsula . Ideas about free trade and physiocratic economics were raised by the Enlightenment in Spain . The political reforms implemented and the many constitutions written both in Spain and throughout the Spanish world during the wars of independence were influenced by these factors .

 = = = Collapse of the Bourbon dynasty = = = 
 The Peninsular War was the trigger for the wars of independence . The Peninsular War began an extended period of instability in the world @-@ wide Spanish monarchy that lasted until 1823 . Napoleon 's removal of the Bourbon dynasty from the Spanish throne precipitated a political crisis . Although the Spanish world almost uniformly rejected Napoleon 's plan to give the crown to his brother , Joseph , there was no clear solution to the lack of a king . Following traditional Spanish political theories on the contractual nature of the monarchy ( see Philosophy of Law of Francisco Suárez ) , the peninsular provinces responded to the crisis by establishing juntas . The move , however , led to more confusion , since there was no central authority and most juntas did not recognize the presumptuous claim of some juntas to represent the monarchy as a whole . The Junta of Seville , in particular , claimed authority over the overseas empire , because of the province 's historic role as the exclusive entrepôt of the empire . 
 = = = Rebellion against Spanish rule = = = 
 This impasse was resolved through negotiations between the juntas and the Council of Castile , which led to the creation of a " Supreme Central and Governmental Junta of Spain and the Indies " on September 25 , 1808 . It was agreed that the traditional kingdoms of the peninsula would send two representatives to this Central Junta , and that the overseas kingdoms would send one representative each . These " kingdoms " were defined as " the viceroyalties of New Spain , Peru , New Granada , and Buenos Aires , and the independent captaincies general of the island of Cuba , Puerto Rico , Guatemala , Chile , Province of Venezuela , and the Philippines . " 
 This scheme was criticized for providing unequal representation to the overseas territories ; nevertheless , throughout the end of 1808 and early 1809 , the provincial capitals elected candidates , whose names were forwarded to the capitals of the viceroyalties or captaincies general . Several important and large cities were left without direct representation in the Supreme Junta . In particular Quito and Chuquisaca , which saw themselves as the capitals of kingdoms , resented being subsumed in the larger " kingdom " of Peru . This unrest led to the establishment of juntas in these cities in 1809 , which were eventually quashed by the authorities within the year . An unsuccessful attempt at establishing a junta in New Spain was also stopped . In order to establish a more legitimate government , the Supreme Junta called for the convening of an " extraordinary and general Cortes of the Spanish Nation . " The election scheme for the Cortes , based on provinces and not kingdoms , was more equitable and provided more time to determine what would be considered an overseas province . 
 The dissolution of the Supreme Junta on January 29 , 1810 , because of the reverses suffered after the Battle of Ocaña by the Spanish forces paid with Spanish American money , set off another wave of juntas being established in the Americas . French forces had taken over southern Spain and forced the Supreme Junta to seek refuge in the island @-@ city of Cadiz . The Junta replaced itself with a smaller , five @-@ man council , the Council of Regency of Spain and the Indies . Most Spanish Americans saw no reason to recognize a rump government that was under the threat of being captured by the French at any moment , and began to work for the creation of local juntas to preserve the region 's independence from the French . Junta movements were successful in New Granada ( Colombia ) , Venezuela , Chile and Río de la Plata ( Argentina ) . Less successful , though serious movements , also occurred in Central America . Ultimately , Central America , along with most of New Spain , Quito ( Ecuador ) , Peru , Upper Peru ( Bolivia ) , the Caribbean and the Philippine Islands remained in control of royalists for the next decade and participated in the Spanish Cortes effort to establish a liberal government for the Spanish Monarchy . 
 = = Wars for disputed sovereignty , 1810 – 14 = = 
 The creation of juntas in Spanish America , such as the Junta <unk> de Caracas on April 19 , 1810 , set the stage for the fighting that would afflict the region for the next decade and a half . Political fault lines appeared , and were often the causes of military conflict . On the one hand the juntas challenged the authority of all royal officials , whether they recognized the Regency or not . On the other hand , royal officials and Spanish Americans who desired to keep the empire together were split between liberals , who supported the efforts of the Cortes , and conservatives ( often called " <unk> " in the historiography ) , who did not want to see any innovations in government . Finally , although the juntas claimed to carry out their actions in the name of the deposed king , Ferdinand VII , their creation provided an opportunity for people who favored outright independence to publicly and safely promote their agenda . The proponents of independence called themselves patriots , a term which eventually was generally applied to them . 
 The idea that independence was not the initial concern is evidenced by the fact that few areas declared independence in the years after 1810 . The congresses of Venezuela and New Granada did so in 1811 and also Paraguay in same year ( 14 and 15 of May 1811 ) . Some historians explain the reluctance to declare independence as a " mask of Ferdinand VII " : that is , that patriot leaders felt that they needed to claim loyalty to the deposed monarch in order to prepare the masses for the radical change that full independence eventually would entail . Nevertheless , even areas such as Río de la Plata and Chile , which more or less maintained de facto independence from the peninsular authorities , did not declare independence until quite a few years later , in 1816 and 1818 , respectively . Overall , despite achieving formal or de facto independence , many regions of Spanish America were marked by nearly continuous civil wars , which lasted well into the 1820s . In Mexico , where the junta movement had been stopped in its early stages by a coalition of Peninsular merchants and government officials , efforts to establish a government independent of the Regency or the French took the form of popular rebellion , under the leadership of Miguel Hidalgo . Hidalgo was captured and executed in 1811 , but a resistance movement continued , which declared independence from Spain in 1813 . In Central America , attempts at establishing juntas were also put down , but resulted in significantly less violence . The Caribbean islands , like the Philippines on the other side of the world , were relatively peaceful . Any plots to set up juntas were denounced to the authorities early enough to stop them before they gained widespread support . 
 = = = Social tensions = = = 
 Underlying social tensions had a great impact on the nature of the fighting . Rural areas were pitted against urban centers , as grievances against the authorities found an outlet in the political conflict . This was the case with Hidalgo 's peasant revolt , which was fueled as much by discontent over several years of bad harvests as with events in the Peninsular War . Hidalgo was originally part of a circle of liberal urbanites in Querétaro , who sought to establish a junta . After this conspiracy was discovered , Hidalgo turned to the rural people of the Mexican <unk> to build his army , and their interests soon overshadowed those of the urban intellectuals . A similar tension existed in Venezuela , where the Spanish immigrant José Tomás Boves was able to form a nearly invincible , though informal , royalist army out of the Llanero , mixed @-@ race , plains people , by seeking to destroy the white landowning class . Boves and his followers often disregarded the command of Spanish officials and were not concerned with actually reestablishing the toppled royal government , choosing instead to keep real power among themselves . Finally in the backcountry of Upper Peru , the <unk> kept the idea of independence alive by allying with disenfranchised members of rural society and Native groups , but were never able to take the major population centers . This period witnessed increasingly violent confrontations between Spaniards and Spanish Americans , but this tension was often related to class issues or fomented by patriot leaders to create a new sense of nationalism . After being incited to rid the country of the <unk> ( a disparaging term for Peninsulares ) , Hidalgo 's forces indiscriminately massacred hundreds of Criollos and Peninsulares who had taken refuge at the <unk> de <unk> in Guanajuato . In Venezuela during his Admirable Campaign , Simón Bolívar instituted a policy of a war to the death — in which and royalist Spanish Americans would be purposely spared but even neutral Peninsulares would be killed — in order to drive a wedge between the two groups . This policy laid the ground for the violent royalist reaction under Boves . Often though , royalism or patriotism simply provided a banner to organize the aggrieved , and the political causes could be discarded just as quickly as they were picked up . The Venezuelan <unk> switched to the patriot banner once the elites and the urban centers became securely royalist after 1815 , and it was the royal army in Mexico that ultimately brought about that nation 's independence . 
 = = = Regional rivalry = = = 
 Regional rivalry also played an important role in the wars . The disappearance of a central , imperial authority — and in some cases of even a local , viceregal authority ( as in the cases of New Granada and Río de la Plata ) — initiated a prolonged period of <unk> in many regions of Spanish America . It was not clear which political units which should replace the empire , and there were no new national identities to replace the traditional sense of being Spaniards . The original juntas of 1810 appealed first , to sense of being Spanish , which was counterposed to the French threat ; second , to a general American identity , which was counterposed to the Peninsula lost to the French ; and third , to a sense of belonging to the local province , the patria in Spanish . More often than not , juntas sought to maintain a province 's independence from the capital of the former viceroyalty or captaincy general as much as from the Peninsula itself . Armed conflicts broke out between the provinces over the question of whether some provinces were to be subordinate to others as they had been under the crown . This phenomenon was particularly evident in New Granada and Río de la Plata . This rivalry also leads some regions to adopt the opposite political cause to that chosen by their rivals . Peru seems to have remained strongly royalist in large part because of its rivalry with Río de la Plata , to which it had lost control of Upper Peru when the later was elevated to a viceroyalty in 1776 . The creation of juntas in Río de la Plata allowed Peru to regain formal control of Upper Peru for the duration of the wars . 
 = = The king 's war against independence , 1814 – 20 = = 
 By 1815 the general outlines of which areas were controlled by royalists and pro @-@ independence forces were established and a general stalemate set in the war . In areas where royalists controlled the main population centers , most of the fighting by those seeking independence was done by isolated guerrilla bands . In New Spain , the two main guerrilla groups were led by Guadalupe Victoria in Puebla and Vicente Guerrero in Oaxaca . In northern South America , New Granadan and Venezuelan patriots , under leaders such as Francisco de Paula Santander , Simón Bolívar , Santiago Mariño , Manuel Piar and José Antonio Páez , carried out campaigns in the vast Orinoco River basin and along the Caribbean coast , often with material aid coming from Curaçao and Haiti . Also , as mentioned above , in Upper Peru , guerrilla bands controlled the isolated , rural parts of the country . 
 = = = Restoration of Ferdinand VII = = = 
 In March 1814 , following with the collapse of the First French Empire , Ferdinand VII was restored to the Spanish throne . This signified an important change , since most of the political and legal changes made on both sides of the Atlantic — the myriad of juntas , the Cortes in Spain and several of the congresses in the Americas , and many of the constitutions and new legal codes — had been made in his name . Before entering Spanish territory , Ferdinand made loose promises to the Cortes that he would uphold the Spanish Constitution . But once in Spain he realized that he had significant support from conservatives in the general population and the hierarchy of the Spanish Catholic Church ; so , on May 4 , he repudiated the Constitution and ordered the arrest of liberal leaders on May 10 . Ferdinand justified his actions by stating that the Constitution and other changes had been made by a Cortes assembled in his absence and without his consent . He restored the former legal codes and political institutions and promised to convene a new Cortes under its traditional form ( with separate chambers for the clergy and the nobility ) , a promise never fulfilled . News of the events arrived through Spanish America during the next three weeks to nine months , depending on time it took goods and people to travel from Spain . 
 Ferdinand 's actions constituted a definitive de facto break both with the autonomous governments , which had not yet declared formal independence , and with the effort of Spanish liberals to create a representative government that would fully include the overseas possessions . Such a government was seen as an alternative to independence by many in New Spain , Central America , the Caribbean , Quito , Peru , Upper Peru and Chile . Yet the news of the restoration of the " ancien régime " did not initiate a new wave of juntas , as had happened in 1809 and 1810 , with the notable exception of the establishment of a junta in Cuzco demanding the implementation of the Spanish Constitution . Instead most Spanish Americans were moderates who decided to wait and see what would come out of the restoration of normalcy . In fact , in areas of New Spain , Central America and Quito , governors found it expedient to leave the elected constitutional ayuntamientos in place for several years in order to prevent conflict with the local society . Liberals on both sides of the Atlantic , nevertheless , continued to conspire to bring back a constitutional monarchy , ultimately succeeding in 1820 . The most dramatic example of transatlantic collaboration is perhaps Francisco Javier Mina 's expedition to Texas and northern Mexico in 1816 and 1817 . 
 Spanish Americans in royalist areas who were committed to independence had already joined the guerrilla movements . However , Ferdinand 's actions did set areas outside of the control of the crown on the path to full independence . The governments of these regions , which had their origins in the juntas of 1810 , and even moderates there , who had entertained a reconciliation with the crown , now saw the need to separate from Spain if they were to protect the reforms they had enacted . 
 = = = Royalist military = = = 
 During this period , royalist forces made advances into New Granada , which they controlled from 1815 to 1819 , and into Chile , which they controlled from 1814 to 1817 . Except for royalist areas in the northeast and south , the provinces of New Granada had maintained independence from Spain since 1810 , unlike neighboring Venezuela , where royalists and pro @-@ independence forces had exchanged control of the region several times . To pacify Venezuela and to retake New Granada , Spain organized in 1815 the largest armed force it ever sent to the New World , consisting of 10 @,@ 500 troops and nearly sixty ships . ( See , Spanish reconquest of New Granada . ) Although this force was crucial in retaking a solidly pro @-@ independence region like New Granada , its soldiers were eventually spread out throughout Venezuela , New Granada , Quito , and Peru and were lost to tropical diseases , diluting their impact on the war . More importantly , the majority of the royalist forces were composed , not of soldiers sent from the peninsula , but of Spanish Americans . 
 Overall , Europeans formed only about a tenth of the royalist armies in Spanish America , and only about half of the expeditionary units , once they were deployed in the Americas . Since each European soldier casualty was replaced by a Spanish American soldier , over time , there were more and more Spanish American soldiers in the expeditionary units . For example , Pablo Morillo , commander in chief of the expeditionary force sent to South America , reported that he had only 2 @,@ 000 European soldiers under his command in 1820 ; in other words , only half the soldiers of his expeditionary force were European . It is estimated that in the Battle of Maipú only a quarter of the royalist forces were European soldiers , in the Battle of Carabobo about a fifth , and in the Battle of Ayacucho less than 1 % was European . 
 The American militias reflected the racial make @-@ up of the local population . For example , in 1820 the royalist army in Venezuela had 843 white ( español ) , 5 @,@ 378 Casta and 980 Indigenous soldiers . 
 = = = Patriot advances = = = 
 Towards the end of this period the pro @-@ independence forces made two important advances . In the Southern Cone , a veteran of the Spanish army with experience in the Peninsular War , José de San Martín , became the governor of the Province of Cuyo . He used this position to begin organizing an army as early as 1814 in preparation for an invasion of Chile . This was an important change in strategy after three United Provinces campaigns had been defeated in Upper Peru . San Martín 's army became the nucleus of the Army of the Andes , which received crucial political and material support in 1816 when Juan Martín de Pueyrredón became Supreme Director of the United Provinces . In January 1817 , San Martín was finally ready to advance against the royalists in Chile . Ignoring an injunction from the congress of the Río de la Plata not to move against Chile , San Martín together with General Bernardo O 'Higgins Riquelme , later Supreme Director of Chile , led the Army over the Andes in a move that turned the tables on the royalists . By February 10 , San Martín had control of northern and central Chile , and a year later , after a war with no quarter , the south . With the aid of a fleet under the command of former British naval officer Thomas Cochrane , Chile was secured from royalist control and independence was declared that year . San Martín and his allies spent the next two years planning an invasion of Peru , which began in 1820 . 
 In northern South America , after several failed campaigns to take Caracas and other urban centers of Venezuela , Simón Bolívar devised a similar plan in 1819 to cross the Andes and liberate New Granada from the royalists . Like San Martín , Bolívar personally undertook the efforts to create an army to invade a neighboring country , collaborated with pro @-@ independence exiles from that region , and lacked the approval of the Venezuelan congress . Unlike San Martín , however , Bolívar did not have a professionally trained army , but rather a quickly assembled mix of Llanero guerrillas , New Granadan exiles led by Santander and British recruits . From June to July 1819 , using the rainy season as cover , Bolívar led his army across the flooded plains and over the cold , forbidding passes of the Andes , with heavy losses — a quarter of the British Legion perished , as well as many of his Llanero soldiers , who were not prepared for the nearly 4 @,@ 000 @-@ meter altitudes — but the gamble paid off . By August Bolívar was in control of Bogotá and its treasury , and gained the support of many in New Granada , which still resented the harsh reconquest carried out under Morillo . Nevertheless , Santander found it necessary to continue the policy of the " war to the death " and carried out the execution of thirty @-@ eight royalist officers who had surrendered . With the resources of New Granada , Bolívar became the undisputed leader of the patriots in Venezuela and orchestrated the union of the two regions in a new state called Colombia ( Gran Colombia ) . 
 = = Independence consolidated , 1820 – 33 = = 
 To counter the advances the pro @-@ independence forces had made in South America , Spain prepared a second , large , expeditionary force in 1819 . This force , however , never left Spain . Instead , it became the means by which liberals were finally able to reinstate a constitutional regime . On January 1 , 1820 , Rafael Riego , commander of the Asturias Battalion , headed a rebellion among the troops , demanding the return of the 1812 Constitution . His troops marched through the cities of Andalusia with the hope of extending the uprising to the civilian population , but locals were mostly indifferent . An uprising , however , did occur in Galicia in northern Spain , and from there it quickly spread throughout the country . On March 7 , the royal palace in Madrid was surrounded by soldiers under the command of General Francisco Ballesteros , and three days later , on March 10 , the besieged Ferdinand VII , now a virtual prisoner , agreed to restore the Constitution . 
 Riego 's Revolt had two significant effects on the war in the Americas . Militarily , the large numbers of reinforcements , which were especially needed to retake New Granada and defend the Viceroyalty of Peru , would never arrive . Furthermore , as the royalists ' situation became more desperate in region after region , the army experienced wholesale defections of units to the patriot side . Politically , the reinstitution of a liberal regime changed the terms under which the Spanish government sought to engage the insurgents . The new government naively assumed that the insurgents were fighting for Spanish liberalism and that the Spanish Constitution could still be the basis of reconciliation between the two sides . The government implemented the Constitution and held elections in the overseas provinces , just as in Spain . It also ordered military commanders to begin armistice negotiations with the insurgents with the promise that they could participate in the restored representative government . 
 = = = New Spain and Central America = = = 
 In effect , the Spanish Constitution of 1812 adopted by the Cortes de Cadiz served as the basis for independence in New Spain and Central America , since in both regions it was a coalition of conservative and liberal royalist leaders who led the establishment of new states . The restoration of the Spanish Constitution and representative government was enthusiastically welcomed in New Spain and Central America . Elections were held , local governments formed and deputies sent to the Cortes . Among liberals , however , there was fear that the new regime would not last ; and conservatives and the Church worried that the new liberal government would expand its reforms and anti @-@ clerical legislation . This climate of instability created the conditions for the two sides to forge an alliance . This alliance coalesced towards the end of 1820 behind Agustín de Iturbide , a colonel in the royal army , who at the time was assigned to destroy the guerrilla forces led by Vicente Guerrero . In January 1821 , Iturbide began peace negotiations with Guerrero , suggesting they unite to establish an independent New Spain . The simple terms that Iturbide proposed became the basis of the Plan of Iguala : the independence of New Spain ( now to be called the Mexican Empire ) with Ferdinand VII or another Bourbon as emperor ; the retention of the Catholic Church as the official state religion and the protection of its existing privileges ; and the equality of all New Spaniards , whether immigrants or native @-@ born . The following month the other important guerrilla leader , Guadalupe Victoria , joined the alliance , and March 1 Iturbide was proclaimed head of a new Army of the Three Guarantees . The representative of the new Spanish government , Superior Political Chief Juan O 'Donojú , who replaced the previous viceroys , arrived in Veracruz on July 1 ; but he found that royalists the entire country except for Veracruz , Mexico City and Acapulco . Since at the time that O 'Donojú had left Spain , the Cortes was considering greatly expanding the autonomy of the overseas Spanish possessions , O 'Donojú proposed to negotiate a treaty with Iturbide on the terms of the Plan of Iguala . The resulting Treaty of Córdoba , which was signed on August 24 , kept all existing laws , including the 1812 Constitution , in force until a new constitution for Mexico could be written . O 'Donojú became part of the provisional governing junta until his death on October 8 . Both the Spanish Cortes and Ferdinand VII rejected the Treaty of Córdoba , and the final break with the mother country came on May 19 , 1822 , when the Mexican Congress conferred the throne on <unk> . 
 Central America gained its independence along with New Spain . The regional elites supported the terms of the Plan of Iguala and orchestrated the union of Central America with the Mexican Empire in 1821 . Two years later , following Iturbide 's downfall , the region , with the exception of Chiapas , peacefully seceded from Mexico in July 1823 , establishing the Federal Republic of Central America . The new state existed for seventeen years , centrifugal forces pulling the individual provinces apart by 1840 . 
 = = = South America = = = 
 Unlike in New Spain and Central America , in South America independence was spurred by the pro @-@ independence fighters who had held out for the past half decade . José de San Martín and Simón Bolívar inadvertently led a continent @-@ wide pincer movement from southern and northern South America that liberated most of the Spanish American nations on that continent . After securing the independence of Chile in 1818 , San Martín concentrated on building a naval fleet in the Pacific to counter Spanish control of those waters and reach the royalist stronghold of Lima . By mid @-@ 1820 San Martín had assembled a fleet of eight warships and sixteen transport ships under the command of Admiral Cochrane . The fleet set sail from Valparaíso to Paracas in southern Peru . On September 7 , the army landed at Paracas and successfully took Pisco . After this , San Martín , waiting for a generalized Peruvian revolt , chose to avoid direct military confrontation . San Martín hoped that his presence would initiate an authentic Peruvian revolt against Spanish rule , believing that otherwise any liberation would be ephemeral . In the meantime , San Martín engaged in diplomacy with Viceroy Joaquín de la Pezuela , who was under orders from the constitutional government to negotiate on the basis of the 1812 Constitution and to maintain the unity of the Spanish Monarchy . However , these efforts proved fruitless , since independence and unity of the monarchy could not be reconciled , so the army sailed in late October to a better strategic position in <unk> , in northern Peru . During the next few months , successful land and naval campaigns against the royalists secured the new foothold , and it was at <unk> that San Martín learned that Guayaquil ( in Ecuador ) had declared independence on October 9 . 
 Bolívar , learning about the collapse of the Cadiz expedition , spent the year 1820 preparing a liberating campaign in Venezuela . Bolívar was aided by Spain 's new policy of seeking engagement with the insurgents , which Morillo implemented , renouncing to the command in chief , and returning to Spain . Although Bolívar rejected the Spanish proposal that the patriots rejoin Spain under the Spanish Constitution , the two sides established a six @-@ month truce and the regularization of the rules of engagement under the law of nations on November 25 and 26 . The truce did not last six months . It was apparent to all that the royalist cause had been greatly weakened by the lack of reinforcements . Royalist soldiers and whole units began to desert or defect to the patriots in large numbers . On January 28 , 1821 , the ayuntamiento of Maracaibo , declared the province an independent republic that chose to join the new nation state of Gran Colombia . Miguel de la Torre , who had replaced Morillo as head of the army , took this to be a violation of the truce , and although the republicans argued that Maracaibo had switched sides of its own volition , both sides began to prepare for renewed war . The fate of Venezuela was sealed when Bolívar returned there in April leading an army of 7 @,@ 000 from New Granada . At the Battle of Carabobo on June 24 , the Gran Colombian forces decisively defeated the royalist forces , assuring control of Venezuela save for Puerto Cabello and guaranteeing Venezuelan independence . Bolívar could now concentrate on Gran Colombia 's claims to southern New Granada and Quito . 
 In Peru , on January 29 , 1821 , Viceroy Pezuela was deposed in a coup d 'état by José de la Serna , but it would be two months before San Martín moved his army closer to Lima by sailing it to <unk> . During the next few months San Martín once again engaged in negotiations , offering the creation of an independent monarchy ; but La Serna insisted on the unity of the Spanish monarchy , so the negotiations came to nothing . By July La Serna judged his hold on Lima to be weak , and on July 8 the royal army abandoned the coastal city in order to reinforce positions in the highlands , with Cuzco as new capital of viceroyalty . On the 12th San Martín entered Lima , where he was declared " Protector of the Country " on July 28 , an office which allowed him to rule the newly independent state . 
 To ensure that the Presidency of Quito became a part of Gran Colombia and did not remain a collection of small , divided republics , Bolívar sent aid in the form of supplies and an army under Antonio José de Sucre to Guayaquil in February 1821 . For a year Sucre was unable to take Quito , and by November both sides , exhausted , signed a ninety @-@ day armistice . The following year , at Battle of Pichincha on May 24 , 1822 , Sucre 's Venezuelan forces finally conquered Quito ; Gran Colombia 's hold on the territory was secure . The following year , after a Peruvian patriot army was destroyed in the Battle of Ica , San Martín met with Simón Bolívar in Guayaquil on July 26 and 27 . Thereafter San Martín decided to retire from the scene . For the next two years , two armies of <unk> ( Argentinian ) , Chilean , Colombian and Peruvian patriots were destroyed trying to penetrate the royalist bastion in the Andean regions of Peru and Upper Peru . A year later a Peruvian congress resolved to make Bolívar head of the patriot forces in the country . An internecine conflict between La Serna and General Pedro Antonio Olañeta , which was an extension of the Liberal Triennium , proved to be the royalists ' undoing . La Serna lost control of half of his best army by the beginning of 1824 , giving the patriots an opportunity . 
 Under the command of Bolivar and Sucre , the experienced veterans of the combined army , mainly Colombians , destroyed a royalist army under La Serna 's command in the Battle of Ayacucho on December 9 , 1824 . La Serna 's army was numerically superior but consisted of mostly new recruits . The only significant royalist area remaining on the continent was the highland country of Upper Peru . Following the Battle of Ayacucho , the royalist troops of Upper Peru under the command of Olañeta surrendered after he died in <unk> on April 2 , 1825 . Bolívar tended to favor maintaining the unity of Upper Peru with Peru , but the Upper Peruvian leaders — many former royalists , like Casimiro Olañeta , nephew of General Olañeta — gathered in a congress under Sucre 's auspices supported the country 's independence . Bolívar left the decision to Sucre , who went along with the congress . Sucre proclaimed Upper Peru 's independence in the city which now bears his name on August 6 , bringing the main wars of independence to an end . 
 As it became clear that there was to be no reversal of Spanish American independence , several of the new states began to receive international recognition . Early , in 1822 , the United States recognized Chile , the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata , Peru , Gran Colombia , and Mexico . Britain waited until 1825 , after the Battle of Ayacucho , to recognize Mexico , Gran Colombia , and Río de la Plata . Both nations recognized more Spanish American states in the next few years .

 The Spanish coastal fortifications in Veracruz , Callao and Chiloé were the footholds that resisted until 1825 and 1826 respectively . In the following decade , royalist guerrillas continued to operate in several countries and Spain launched a few attempts to retake parts of the Spanish American mainland . In 1827 Colonel José <unk> started an irregular war with Venezuelan guerrillas , and Brigadier Isidro <unk> lead the last attempt with regular troops to reconquer Mexico in 1829 . The <unk> brothers moved to Patagonia and remained there as royalist outlaws until defeated in 1832 . But efforts like these did not reverse the new political situation . 
 The increasing irrelevancy of the Holy Alliance after 1825 and the fall of absolutism in France in 1830 during the July Revolution eliminated the principal support of Ferdinand VII in Europe , but it was not until the king 's death in 1833 that Spain finally abandoned all plans of military re @-@ conquest , and in 1836 its government went so far as to renounce sovereignty over all of continental America . During the course of the 19th century , Spain would recognize each of the new states . Only Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under Spanish rule , until the Spanish – American War in 1898 . 
 = = Effects of independence = = 
 = = = Economics = = = 
 The nearly decade and a half of wars greatly weakened the Spanish American economies and political institutions , which hindered the region 's potential economic development for most of the nineteenth century and resulted in the enduring instability the region experienced . Independence destroyed the de facto trade bloc that was the Spanish Empire - Manila galleons and Spanish treasure fleets in particular . After independence , trade among the new Spanish American nations was less than it had been in the colonial period . Once the ties were broken , the small populations of most of the new nations provided little incentive to entice Spanish American producers to recreate the old trade patterns . In addition , the protection against European competition , which the Spanish monopoly had provided to the manufacturing sectors of the economy , ended . Due to expediency , protective tariffs for these sectors , in particular textile production , were permanently dropped and foreign imports beat out local production . This greatly affected Native communities , which in many parts of Spanish America , specialized in supplying finished products to the urban markets , albeit using pre @-@ industrial techniques . The wars also greatly affected the principal economic sector of the region , mining . Silver production in Bolivia halved after independence and it dropped by three quarters in Mexico . 
 To compensate for the lack of capital , foreign investment , in particular from Great Britain , was courted , but it was not sizable enough to initiate an economic recovery . Finally the new nations entered the world economy after the end of the French Revolutionary and Napoleonic Wars , when the economies of Europe and the United States were recovering and aggressively seeking new markets to sell their products after more than two decades of disruption . Ultimately Spanish America could only connect to the world markets as an exporter of raw materials and a consumer of finished products . 
 = = = Society = = = 
 In addition to improving the economy , the lower social classes also had to be integrated into the new body politic , although they often got few rewards from independence . The political debate seeking answers to these questions was marked by a clash — at times on the battlefield — between liberalism and conservatism . Conservatives sought to maintain the traditional social structures in order to ensure stability ; liberals sought to create a more dynamic society and economy by ending ethnically @-@ based social distinctions and freeing property from economic restrictions . In its quest to transform society , liberals often adopted policies that were not welcome by Native communities , who had benefited from unique protections afforded to them by traditional Spanish law . 
 Independence , however , did initiate the abolition of slavery in Spanish America , as it was seen as part of the independence struggle , since many slaves had gained their manumission by joining the patriot armies . In areas where slavery was not a major source of labor ( Mexico , Central America , Chile ) , emancipation occurred almost immediately after independence was achieved . In areas where slavery was a main labor source ( Colombia , Venezuela , Peru , Argentina ) , emancipation was carried out in steps over the next three decades , usually first with the creation of free @-@ womb laws and programs for compensated emancipation . By the early 1850s , slavery had been abolished in the independent nations of Spanish America . 
 = = = Role of women = = = 
 Women were not simply spectators throughout the Independence Wars of Latin America . Many women took sides on political issues and joined independence movements in order to participate on many different levels . Women could not help but act as caring relatives either as mother , sister , wives or daughters of the men who were fighting . Women created political organizations and organized meetings and groups to donate food and supplies to the soldiers . Some women supported the wars as spies , informants and combatants . Manuela Sáenz was a long term lover of Simón Bolívar and acted as his spy and confidante and was secretary of his archive . She saved his life on two occasions , nursed wounded soldiers and has even been believed some historians to have fought in a few battles . Sáenz followed Bolivar and his army through the independence wars and became to be known in Latin America as the “ mother of feminism and women ’ s emancipation and equal rights . ” Bolivar himself was a supporter of women ’ s rights and suffrage in Latin America . It was Bolivar who allowed for Sáenz to become the great pioneer of women ’ s freedom . He wanted to set the women of Latin America free from the oppression and inferiority of what the Spanish regime had established . Bolivar even made Sáenz a Colonel of the Colombian Army due to her heroics which caused controversy because there were no women in the army at the time . Another woman who gained prominence in the fight for independence was Juana <unk> de Padilla , a mixed @-@ race woman who fought for the independence of in the Rio de la Plata region . Argentine President Cristina Fernández de Kirchner posthumously promoted her to the rank of general . 
 According to gender stereotypes , women were not meant to be soldiers ; only men were supposed to engage in the fighting and conflict . There were still plenty of women presence on the battlefields to help rescue and nurse soldiers . Some women fought alongside their husbands and sons on the battlefield . The majority of women assumed supportive and non @-@ competitive roles such as fund raising and caring for the sick . Revolution for women meant something differently than to men . Women saw revolution as a way to earn equal rights as men , such as voting , and to overcome the suppression of the superiority of men over women . Women were usually identified as victims during the independence wars for the women of Latin America were forced to sacrifice for the cause . The ideals of womanhood meant that women must sacrifice what the situation required such as a mother sacrificing her son or a virgin knowing she might be sacrificing motherhood or being wife due to the loss of many young men . This view meant that women were meant to contribute to independence in a supportive role while leaving the combat and politics in the hands of the men . 
 = = = Government and politics = = = 
 Independence also did not result in stable political regimes , save in a few countries . First , the new nations did not have well @-@ defined identities , but rather the process of creating identities was only beginning . This would be carried out through newspapers and the creation of national symbols , including new names for the countries ( " Mexico " , " Colombia , " " Ecuador , " " Bolivia , " " Argentina " ) , that broke with the past . In addition , the borders were also not firmly established , and the struggle between federalism and centralism , which begun in independence , continued throughout the rest of the century . Two large states that emerged from the wars — Gran Colombia and the Federal Republic of Central America — collapsed after a decade or two , and Argentina would not consolidate politically until the 1860s . 
 The wars destroyed the old civilian bureaucracy that had governed the region for centuries , as institutions such as the <unk> were eliminated and many Peninsular officials fled to Spain . The Catholic Church , which had been an important social and political institution during the colonial period , initially came out weakened by the end of the conflicts . As with government officials , many Peninsular bishops abandoned their dioceses and their posts were not filled for decades until new prelates could be created and relations between the new nations and the Vatican was regularized . Then as the Church recovered , its economic and political power was attacked by liberals . 
 Despite the fact that the period of the wars of independence itself was marked by a rapid expansion of representative government , for several of the new nations the nineteenth century was marked by militarism because of the lack of well @-@ defined political and national institutions . The armies and officers that came into existence during the process of independence wanted to ensure that they got their rewards once the struggle was over . Many of these armies did not fully disband once the wars were over and they proved to be one of the <unk> institutions in the first decades of national existence . These armies and their leaders effectively influenced the course of political development . Out of this new tradition came the caudillos , strongmen who amassed formal and informal economic , military and political power in themselves .

 = Green = 
 Green is the color between blue and yellow on the spectrum of visible light . It is evoked by light with a predominant wavelength of roughly 495 – 570 nm . In the subtractive color system , used in painting and color printing , it is created by a combination of yellow and blue , or yellow and cyan ; in the RGB color model , used on television and computer screens , it is one of the additive primary colors , along with red and blue , which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors . 
 The modern English word green comes from the Middle English and Anglo @-@ Saxon word <unk> , from the same Germanic root as the words " grass " and " grow " . It is the color of living grass and leaves and as a result is the color most associated with springtime , growth and nature . By far the largest contributor to green in nature is chlorophyll , the chemical by which plants photosynthesize and convert sunlight into chemical energy . Many creatures have adapted to their green environments by taking on a green hue themselves as camouflage . Several minerals have a green color , including the emerald , which is colored green by its chromium content . 
 In surveys made in Europe and the United States , green is the color most commonly associated with nature , life , health , youth , spring , hope and envy . In Europe and the U.S. green is sometimes associated with death ( green has several seemingly contrary associations ) , sickness , or the devil , but in China its associations are very positive , as the symbol of fertility and happiness . In the Middle Ages and Renaissance , when the color of clothing showed the owner 's social status , green was worn by merchants , bankers and the gentry , while red was the color of the nobility . The Mona Lisa by Leonardo da Vinci wears green , showing she is not from a noble family ; the benches in the British House of Commons are green , while those in the House of Lords are red . Green is also the traditional color of safety and permission ; a green light means go ahead , a green card permits permanent residence in the United States . It is the most important color in Islam . It was the color of the banner of Muhammad , and is found in the flags of nearly all Islamic countries , and represents the lush vegetation of Paradise . It is also often associated with the culture of Gaelic Ireland , and is a color of the flag of Ireland . Because of its association with nature , it is the color of the environmental movement . Political groups advocating environmental protection and social justice describe themselves as part of the Green movement , some naming themselves Green parties . This has led to similar campaigns in advertising , as companies have sold green , or environmentally friendly , products . 
 = = Etymology and linguistic definitions = = 
 The word green comes from the Middle English and Old English word <unk> , which , like the German word <unk> , has the same root as the words grass and grow . It is from a Common Germanic * <unk> , which is also reflected in Old Norse <unk> , Old High German <unk> ( but unattested in East Germanic ) , ultimately from a PIE root * <unk> " to grow " , and root @-@ cognate with grass and to grow . The first recorded use of the word as a color term in Old English dates to ca . AD 700 . 
 Latin with viridis also has a genuine and widely used term for " green " . Related to <unk> " to grow " and ver " spring " , it gave rise to words in several Romance languages , French vert , Italian verde ( and English vert , verdure etc . ) . Likewise the Slavic languages with <unk> . Ancient Greek also had a term for yellowish , pale green – <unk> , <unk> ( cf. the color of chlorine ) , cognate with <unk> " verdant " and <unk> " the green of new growth " . 
 Thus , the languages mentioned above ( Germanic , Romance , Slavic , Greek ) have old terms for " green " which are derived from words for fresh , sprouting vegetation . However , comparative linguistics makes clear that these terms were coined independently , over the past few millennia , and there is no identifiable single Proto @-@ Indo @-@ European or word for " green " . For example , the Slavic <unk> is cognate with Sanskrit hari " yellow , ochre , golden " . The Turkic languages also have <unk> " green " or " yellowish green " , compared to a Mongolian word for " meadow " . 
 = = = Languages where green and blue are one color = = = 
 In some languages , including old Chinese , Thai , old Japanese , and Vietnamese , the same word can mean either blue or green . The Chinese character 青 ( pronounced <unk> in Mandarin , ao in Japanese , and <unk> in Sino @-@ Vietnamese ) has a meaning that covers both blue and green ; blue and green are traditionally considered shades of " 青 " . In more contemporary terms , they are <unk> ( <unk> , in Mandarin ) and <unk> ( <unk> , in Mandarin ) respectively . Japanese also has two terms that refer specifically to the color green , 緑 ( <unk> , which is derived from the classical Japanese descriptive verb <unk> " to be in leaf , to flourish " in reference to trees ) and <unk> ( <unk> , which is derived from the English word " green " ) . However , in Japan , although the traffic lights have the same colors that other countries have , the green light is described using the same word as for blue , " aoi " , because green is considered a shade of aoi ; similarly , green variants of certain fruits and vegetables such as green apples , green <unk> ( as opposed to red apples and red <unk> ) will be described with the word " aoi " . Vietnamese uses a single word for both blue and green , xanh , with variants such as xanh da <unk> ( azure , lit . " sky blue " ) , lam ( blue ) , and <unk> ( green ; also xanh lá <unk> , lit . " leaf green " ) . 
 " Green " in modern European languages corresponds to about 520 – 570 nm , but many historical and non @-@ European languages make other choices , e.g. using a term for the range of ca . 450 – 530 nm ( " blue / green " ) and another for ca . 530 – 590 nm ( " green / yellow " ) . In the comparative study of color terms in the world 's languages , green is only found as a separate category in languages with the fully developed range of six colors ( white , black , red , green , yellow , and blue ) , or more rarely in systems with five colors ( white , red , yellow , green , and black / blue ) . ( See distinction of green from blue ) These languages have introduced supplementary vocabulary to denote " green " , but these terms are recognizable as recent adoptions that are not in origin color terms ( much like the English adjective orange being in origin not a color term but the name of a fruit ) . Thus , the Thai word <unk> <unk> , besides meaning " green " , also means " rank " and " smelly " and holds other unpleasant associations . 
 The Celtic languages had a term for " blue / green / grey " , Proto @-@ Celtic * <unk> , which gave rise to Old Irish glas " green , grey " and to Welsh glas " blue " . This word is cognate with the Ancient Greek <unk> " bluish green " , contrasting with <unk> " yellowish green " discussed above . 
 In modern Japanese , the term for green is 緑 , while the old term for " blue / green " , blue ( 青 , Ao ) now means " blue " . But in certain contexts , green is still conventionally referred to as 青 , as in blue traffic light ( <unk> , ao <unk> ) and blue leaves ( <unk> , <unk> ) , reflecting the absence of blue @-@ green distinction in old Japanese ( more accurately , the traditional Japanese color terminology grouped some shades of green with blue , and others with yellow tones ) . 
 The Persian language is traditionally lacking a black / blue / green distinction . The Persian word سبز sabz can mean " green " , " black " , or " dark " . Thus , Persian erotic poetry , dark @-@ skinned women are addressed as sabz @-@ eh , as in phrases like سبز <unk> <unk> sabz @-@ eh @-@ <unk> @-@ gun ( literally " dark wheat colored " ) or سبز <unk> sabz @-@ eh @-@ <unk> ( " a dark beauty " ) . Similarly , in Sudanese Arabic , dark @-@ skinned people are described as <unk> <unk> , the term which in Standard Arabic stands unambiguously for " green " .

 In optics , the perception of green is evoked by light having a spectrum dominated by energy with a wavelength of roughly 495 – 570 nm . The sensitivity of the dark @-@ adapted human eye is greatest at about 507 nm , a blue @-@ green color , while the light @-@ adapted eye is most sensitive about 555 nm , a yellow @-@ green ; these are the peak locations of the rod and cone ( <unk> and <unk> , respectively ) luminosity functions . 
 The perception of greenness ( in opposition to redness forming one of the opponent mechanisms in human color vision ) is evoked by light which triggers the medium @-@ wavelength M cone cells in the eye more than the long @-@ wavelength L cones . Light which triggers this greenness response more than the <unk> or blueness of the other color opponent mechanism is called green . A green light source typically has a spectral power distribution dominated by energy with a wavelength of roughly 487 – 570 nm . 
 Human eyes have color receptors known as cone cells , of which there are three types . In some cases , one is missing or faulty , which can cause color blindness , including the common inability to distinguish red and yellow from green , known as <unk> or red – green color blindness . Green is restful to the eye . Studies show that a green environment can reduce fatigue . 
 In the subtractive color system , used in painting and color printing , green is created by a combination of yellow and blue , or yellow and cyan ; in the RGB color model , used on television and computer screens , it is one of the additive primary colors , along with red and blue , which are mixed in different combinations to create all other colors . On the HSV color wheel , also known as the RGB color wheel , the complement of green is magenta ; that is , a color corresponding to an equal mixture of red and blue light ( one of the purples ) . On a traditional color wheel , based on subtractive color , the complementary color to green is considered to be red . 
 In additive color devices such as computer displays and televisions , one of the primary light sources is typically a narrow @-@ spectrum yellowish @-@ green of dominant wavelength ~ 550 nm ; this " green " primary is combined with an orangish @-@ red " red " primary and a purplish @-@ blue " blue " primary to produce any color in between – the RGB color model . A unique green ( green appearing neither yellowish nor bluish ) is produced on such a device by mixing light from the green primary with some light from the blue primary . 
 = = = Lasers = = = 
 Lasers emitting in the green part of the spectrum are widely available to the general public in a wide range of output powers . Green laser pointers outputting at 532 nm ( 563 @.@ 5 THz ) are relatively inexpensive compared to other wavelengths of the same power , and are very popular due to their good beam quality and very high apparent brightness . The most common green lasers use diode pumped solid state ( DPSS ) technology to create the green light . An infrared laser diode at 808 nm is used to pump a crystal of neodymium @-@ doped yttrium vanadium oxide ( Nd : <unk> ) or neodymium @-@ doped yttrium aluminium garnet ( Nd : YAG ) and induces it to emit 281 @.@ 76 THz ( 1064 nm ) . This deeper infrared light is then passed through another crystal containing potassium , titanium and phosphorus ( <unk> ) , whose non @-@ linear properties generate light at a frequency that is twice that of the incident beam ( 563 @.@ 5 THz ) ; in this case corresponding to the wavelength of 532 nm ( " green " ) . Other green wavelengths are also available using DPSS technology ranging from 501 nm to 543 nm . Green wavelengths are also available from gas lasers , including the helium – neon laser ( 543 nm ) , the Argon @-@ ion laser ( 514 nm ) and the Krypton @-@ ion laser ( 521 nm and 531 nm ) , as well as liquid dye lasers . Green lasers have a wide variety of applications , including pointing , illumination , surgery , laser light shows , spectroscopy , interferometry , fluorescence , holography , machine vision , non @-@ lethal weapons and bird control . 
 As of mid @-@ 2011 , direct green laser diodes at 510 nm and 500 nm have become generally available , although the price remains relatively prohibitive for widespread public use . The efficiency of these lasers ( peak 3 % ) compared to that of DPSS green lasers ( peak 35 % ) may also be limiting adoption of the diodes to niche uses . 
 = = = Pigments , food coloring and fireworks = = = 
 Many minerals provide pigments which have been used in green paints and dyes over the centuries . Pigments , in this case , are minerals which reflect the color green , rather that emitting it through luminescent or phosphorescent qualities . The large number of green pigments makes it impossible to mention them all . Among the more notable green minerals , however is the emerald , which is colored green by trace amounts of chromium and sometimes vanadium . Chromium ( III ) oxide ( Cr2O3 ) , is called chrome green , also called <unk> or institutional green when used as a pigment . For many years , the source of <unk> 's color was a mystery . Widely thought to have been due to copper because copper compounds often have blue and green colors , the blue @-@ green color is likely to be derived from small quantities of lead and water in the feldspar . Copper is the source of the green color in malachite pigments , chemically known as basic copper ( II ) carbonate . 
 Verdigris is made by placing a plate or blade of copper , brass or bronze , slightly warmed , into a vat of fermenting wine , leaving it there for several weeks , and then scraping off and drying the green powder that forms on the metal . The process of making verdigris was described in ancient times by Pliny . It was used by the Romans in the murals of Pompeii , and in Celtic medieval manuscripts as early as the 5th century AD . It produced a blue @-@ green which no other pigment could imitate , but it had drawbacks ; it was unstable , it could not resist dampness , it did not mix well with other colors , it could ruin other colors with which it came into contact . , and it was toxic . Leonardo da Vinci , in his treatise on painting , warned artists not to use it . It was widely used in miniature paintings in Europe and Persia in the 16th and 17th centuries . Its use largely ended in the late 19th century , when it was replaced by the safer and more stable chrome green . Viridian , also called chrome green , is a pigment made with chromium oxide dihydrate , was patented in 1859 . It became popular with painters , since , unlike other synthetic greens , it was stable and not toxic . Vincent van Gogh used it , along with Prussian blue , to create a dark blue sky with a greenish tint in his painting Cafe terrace at night . 
 Green earth is a natural pigment used since the time of the Roman Empire . It is composed of clay colored by iron oxide , magnesium , aluminum silicate , or potassium . Large deposits were found in the South of France near Nice , and in Italy around Verona , on Cyprus , and in Bohemia . The clay was crushed , washed to remove impurities , then powdered . It was sometimes called Green of Verona . 
 Mixtures of oxidized cobalt and zinc were also used to create green paints as early as the 18th century . 
 Cobalt green , sometimes known as Rinman 's green or Zinc Green , is a translucent green pigment made by heating a mixture of cobalt ( II ) oxide and zinc oxide . Sven Rinman , a Swedish chemist , discovered this compound in 1780 . Green chrome oxide was a new synthetic green created by a chemist named <unk> in Paris in about 1835 . Emerald green was a synthetic deep green made in the 19th century by hydrating chrome oxide . It was also known as <unk> Green . 
 There is no natural source for green food colorings which has been approved by the US Food and Drug Administration . Chlorophyll , the E numbers <unk> and <unk> , is the most common green chemical found in nature , and only allowed in certain medicines and cosmetic materials . <unk> Yellow ( <unk> ) is a commonly used coloring in the United Kingdom but is banned in Australia , Japan , Norway and the United States . Green S ( <unk> ) is prohibited in many countries , for it is known to cause hyperactivity , asthma , urticaria , and insomnia . 
 To create green sparks , fireworks use barium salts , such as barium chlorate , barium nitrate crystals , or barium chloride , also used for green fireplace logs . Copper salts typically burn blue , but cupric chloride ( also known as " campfire blue " ) can also produce green flames . Green pyrotechnic flares can use a mix ratio 75 : 25 of boron and potassium nitrate . Smoke can be turned green by a mixture : solvent yellow 33 , solvent green 3 , lactose , magnesium carbonate plus sodium carbonate added to potassium chlorate . 
 = = = Biology = = = 
 Green is common in nature , as many plants are green because of a complex chemical known as chlorophyll , which is involved in photosynthesis . Chlorophyll absorbs the long wavelengths of light ( red ) and short wavelengths of light ( blue ) much more efficiently than the wavelengths that appear green to the human eye , so light reflected by plants is enriched in green . Chlorophyll absorbs green light poorly because it first arose in organisms living in oceans where purple <unk> were already exploiting photosynthesis . Their purple color arose because they extracted energy in the green portion of the spectrum using <unk> . The new organisms that then later came to dominate the extraction of light were selected to exploit those portions of the spectrum not used by the <unk> . 
 Animals typically use the color green as camouflage , blending in with the chlorophyll green of the surrounding environment . Green animals include , especially , amphibians , reptiles , and some fish , birds and insects . Most fish , reptiles , amphibians , and birds appear green because of a reflection of blue light coming through an over @-@ layer of yellow pigment . Perception of color can also be affected by the surrounding environment . For example , broadleaf forests typically have a yellow @-@ green light about them as the trees filter the light . <unk> is one chemical which can cause a green hue in birds , especially . Invertebrates such as insects or mollusks often display green colors because of porphyrin pigments , sometimes caused by diet . This can causes their feces to look green as well . Other chemicals which generally contribute to greenness among organisms are flavins ( <unk> ) and <unk> . Humans have imitated this by wearing green clothing as a camouflage in military and other fields . Substances that may impart a greenish hue to one 's skin include <unk> , the green pigment in bile , and ceruloplasmin , a protein that carries copper ions in chelation . 
 The green huntsman spider is green due to the presence of <unk> pigments in the spider 's hemolymph ( circulatory system fluids ) and tissue fluids . It hunts insects in green vegetation , where it is well camouflaged . 
 = = = Green eyes = = = 
 There is no green pigment in green eyes ; like the color of blue eyes , it is an optical illusion ; its appearance is caused by the combination of an amber or light brown pigmentation of the stroma , given by a low or moderate concentration of melanin , with the blue tone imparted by the Rayleigh scattering of the reflected light . Green eyes are most common in Northern and Central Europe . They can also be found in Southern Europe , West Asia , Central Asia , and South Asia . In Iceland , 89 % of women and 87 % of men have either blue or green eye color . A study of Icelandic and Dutch adults found green eyes to be much more prevalent in women than in men . Among European Americans , green eyes are most common among those of recent Celtic and Germanic ancestry , about 16 % .

 In Ancient Egypt green was the symbol of regeneration and rebirth , and of the crops made possible by the annual flooding of the Nile . For painting on the walls of tombs or on papyrus , Egyptian artists used finely @-@ ground malachite , mined in the west Sinai and the eastern <unk> A <unk> with malachite pigment was found inside the tomb of King Tutankhamun . They also used less expensive green earth pigment , or mixed yellow ochre and blue azurite . To dye fabrics green , they first colored them yellow with dye made from saffron and then soaked them in blue dye from the roots of the woad plant . 
 For the ancient Egyptians , green had very positive associations . The hieroglyph for green represented a growing papyrus sprout , showing the close connection between green , vegetation , vigor and growth . In wall paintings , the ruler of the underworld , Osiris , was typically portrayed with a green face , because green was the symbol of good health and rebirth . <unk> of green facial makeup , made with malachite , were found in tombs . It was worn by both the living and dead , particularly around the eyes , to protect them from evil . Tombs also often contained small green amulets in the shape of scarab beetles made of malachite , which would protect and give vigor to the deceased . It also symbolized the sea , which was called the " Very Green . " 
 In Ancient Greece , green and blue were sometimes considered the same color , and the same word sometimes described the color of the sea and the color of trees . The philosopher Democritus described two different greens ; <unk> , or pale green , and <unk> , or leek green . Aristotle considered that green was located midway between black , symbolizing the earth , and white , symbolizing water . However , green was not counted among of the four classic colors of Greek painting ; red , yellow , black and white , and is rarely found in Greek art . 
 The Romans had a greater appreciation for the color green ; it was the color of Venus , the goddess of gardens , vegetables and <unk> Romans made a fine green earth pigment , which was widely used in the wall paintings of Pompeii , Herculaneum , Lyon , <unk> @-@ la @-@ Romaine , and other Roman cities . They also used the pigment verdigris , made by soaking copper plates in fermenting wine . By the Second Century AD , the Romans were using green in paintings , mosaics and glass , and there were ten different words in Latin for varieties of green .

 In the Middle Ages and Renaissance , the color of clothing showed a person 's social rank and profession . Red could only be worn by the nobility , brown and gray by peasants , and green by merchants , bankers and the gentry and their families . The Mona Lisa wears green in her portrait , as does the bride in the Arnolfini portrait by Jan van Eyck . 
 Unfortunately for those who wanted or were required to wear green , there were no good vegetal green dyes which resisted washing and sunlight . Green dyes were made out of the fern , plantain , buckthorn berries , the juice of nettles and of leeks , the digitalis plant , the broom plant , the leaves of the <unk> , or ash tree , and the bark of the alder tree , but they rapidly faded or changed color . Only in the 16th century was a good green dye produced , by first dyeing the cloth blue with woad , and then yellow with <unk> <unk> , also known as yellow @-@ weed . 
 The pigments available to painters were more varied ; monks in monasteries used use of verdigris , made by soaking copper in fermenting wine , to color medieval manuscripts . They also used finely @-@ ground malachite , which made a luminous green . They used green earth colors for backgrounds . 
 During the early Renaissance , painters such as Duccio di <unk> learned to paint faces first with a green undercoat , then with pink , which gave the faces a more realistic hue . Over the centuries the pink has faded , making some of the faces look green .
