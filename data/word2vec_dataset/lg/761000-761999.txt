 The gameplay in Shiny Festa eschews the simulation format of previous Idolmaster games , and instead features a rhythmic gameplay in which the player times the presses of buttons to the rhythm of the songs and a predetermined pattern displayed on the screen . Each game features a different array of characters and songs , and also includes an original video animation episode produced by A @-@ 1 Pictures and directed by Atsushi Nishigori . The games ' story centers on the 765 Production 's participation in a music festival , and is told via the anime episodes and occasional dialogue included in the games . 
 Development of Shiny Festa began as a result of series producer Yōzō Sakagami 's desire to create a video game that has a lighter feel and makes use of the franchise 's songs that had not been featured in video game form . Shiny Festa 's original releases sold a total of 119 @,@ 132 copies in its first week of release in Japan , and together ranked as the best @-@ selling video game in Japan that week . The games were described by reviewers as accessible to the franchise 's new and existing fans , but the iOS releases were criticized by journalists for their prohibitive pricing . The mechanics of Shiny Festa later reappear in The Idolmaster Shiny TV , a high @-@ definition remastered version for the PlayStation 3 .

 Shiny Festa is a series of three rhythm games that feature various characters and songs from The Idolmaster video game franchise . At the beginning of each game , a twenty @-@ three @-@ minute anime episode is played to introduce the games ' story : 765 Production ( 765 Pro ) , the talent agency where the protagonist works as a producer , is invited to participate in a music festival ; however , only a few of its members may attend . The characters who attend the music festival , as well as the songs and episode that correspond to the characters , are dependent on the version of the game . In Harmonic Score and Honey Sound , the selected members are Haruka Amami , Chihaya Kisaragi , and Azusa Miura , and they are joined by Ritsuko Akizuki , who also performs in the festival , as their producer ; in Rhythmic Record and Funky Note , Yayoi Takatsuki , Iori Minase , Hibiki <unk> , and Ami and Mami Futami are chosen to attend the festival with the protagonist Producer ; lastly Miki <unk> , <unk> Hagiwara , Makoto Kikuchi , and Takane <unk> make up the group of idols chosen to attend in Melodic Disc and Groovy Tune . 
 Like other games in the genre , the player plays the main portion of Shiny Festa 's gameplay , Stage mode , as he or she listens to a selected song . Each song 's performance is limited to a predetermined idol or group of idols , unlike the franchise 's previous games . During a song , a predetermined sequence of note icons scroll along several lines , called Melody Lines , toward a central target icon . To complete a song , the player must press buttons that correspond to the direction from which the notes originate from — the buttons on the console 's left and right halves for the PlayStation Portable version , and the left and right halves of the screen for the iOS version — as they pass over the target icon . The player is scored by these presses ' accuracy in timing and direction , for which he or she is given one of four ratings : Perfect , Good , Normal , and Bad . The player 's performance is also represented by the Sparkle Meter , which increases or decreases as the player successfully or fails to hit a note . Throughout the song , new target icons and lines may spawn at predetermined times in different locations of the screen to supersede or accompany old ones . The note sequences may also include Long Icons , which are streaks of notes that need to be continuously held down ; Simultaneous Icons , which are pairs of icons that pass over the target icon simultaneously ; and Shooting Stars , which appears once the Sparkle Meter is filled , and causes a Shining Burst that raises the player 's score and changes the song 's accompanying music video when it is hit . The complexity of the song 's sequence varies based on the player 's selected difficulty for the song ; there are four difficulty levels : Debut , Normal , Pro , and Master from the easiest to the hardest . 
 At the end of each song , a result screen is displayed to player , and his or her performance is rated with a letter grade , a numerical score , and a percentage that represents his or her accuracy . The player is awarded a number of fans and in @-@ game money for his or her performance . The number of fans determine the idols ' ranking , and as the player 's idols increase in ranking , more items become available for purchase . These items can then be used to customize the game 's appearance or adjust gameplay elements , such as straightening the Melody Lines ' shapes or causing the player to gain fans quicker . Finishing a song also earns the player Memories with the idols who perform the song , which can be used in the Star of Festa game mode . 
 Star of Festa is a gameplay mode in which the player 's idol unit participates in a five @-@ day music festival . On each of the five in @-@ game days , the player is required to consecutively play three songs , and for each song , he or she is given a score that represents votes given by the in @-@ game audience . For the third song every day , the player may choose to compete against a computer @-@ controlled opponent , represented as idols from 876 Production , 961 Production 's Jupiter , and characters from The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls and other Shiny Festa games . By defeating his or her opponent , the player gains additional votes and earns the opponent 's Name Card , which are shared across the three Shiny Festa games and passively grants additional votes . In addition to Name Cards , the player can also earn additional votes by using the Memories an idol has earned toward Memory Boosters . The player may choose to use the Memories of any of the idols who sings in the song , and if it is activated , Memory Booster icons appear throughout the song once the player has received a Shining Burst . To successfully complete Star of Festa , the player must accumulate 100 @,@ 000 votes by the end of the last day . 
 = = Development and release = = 
 The Idolmaster series producer Yōzō Sakagami attributed the development of a rhythm game in the series to two reasons . Noting that songs have a strong meaning to the franchise , he had wanted to make the songs that were included in the series ' albums but not in its video games to be accessible in that form . He also wanted to create an Idolmaster video game that , while maintaining a producer 's viewpoint , has a lighter feel and would allow the player to hum along to the idols as he or she plays . He pointed out that the rhythm game genre fell in line with these two desires , and this led to the development of Shiny Festa . The team chose to develop for the PlayStation Portable ( PSP ) as he felt it was simple to play on . At the same time , the team also wanted to create scenes where the series ' thirteen idols would be able to appear together , and chose to use pre @-@ rendered videos to make this possible . Sakagami also noted that the development team deliberately chose to use a gameplay system in which the note icons float toward the screen 's center to attract the player to look at the videos in the background . 
 The games ' anime scenes were directed by Atsushi Nishigori and produced by A @-@ 1 Pictures , who also created The Idolmaster anime adaptation in 2011 . According to Hironori Toba , Aniplex 's producer for the television anime , he was told about the plans of including anime material in Shiny Festa during production of the TV anime 's final episode , and he did not inform Nishigori until later on . Series director Akihiro Ishihara said that each anime episode was initially planned to be about ten minutes long , but Nishigori extended each episode to its current length , feeling that the episodes would not be fun if they were too short . Three teams were formed to create the three episodes , and Nishigori noted that this enticed each team to compete with each other during production . 
 Shiny Festa was first released in Japan on October 25 , 2012 for the PSP in three versions — Honey Sound , Funky Note , Groovy Tune — in both retail and downloadable forms ; the downloadable versions are also playable on the PlayStation Vita . The PSP games ' first printing also included a " backstage pass " that granted access to an online merchandise store , a product code for the song " The World is All One ! " to be used in the games , and a serial number that granted a special Shiny Festa version of Haruka Amami for use in The Idolmaster Cinderella Girls . In conjunction with the release , peripheral manufacturer Hori released a set of accessories with Shiny Festa designs ; the set includes three cases for the games ' Universal Media Discs , a protective casing , and decorative stickers for the PSP 's 3000 model . The games were later released in English for iOS devices on April 22 , 2013 , and became the first games in the series to be localized and released outside Japan . The titles of the English releases were respectively renamed as Harmonic Score , Rhythmic Record , and Melodic Disc , but the games retained the original titles for the Japanese iOS releases . Support for the iOS releases ended on March 15 , 2016 , and the downloadable content was also be made unavailable on that date . The three anime episodes were released on October 8 , 2014 alongside The Idolmaster Movie : Beyond the Brilliant Future ! as a Blu @-@ ray Disc as part of a limited edition bundle . 
 The mechanics of Shiny Festa were later ported to the PlayStation 3 as The Idolmaster Shiny TV as a high @-@ definition remastered rhythm game . Shiny TV was released as part of the <unk> Channel app on October 2 , 2013 . Unlike the Shiny Festa releases , only one song , " We Have a Dream " , was initially available in Shiny TV , and additional songs are added to the game as downloadable content packs called mini albums . Bandai Namco Games released 12 mini albums for the game between October 2 , 2013 — beginning with the releases of mini albums for Haruka Amami and Yayoi Takatsuki — and February 19 , 2014 . 
 = = = Music = = = 
 Across its three versions , Shiny Festa features a total of 48 songs written and composed by a variety of songwriters . Each version is composed of 20 songs , of which six are performed by 765 Pro Allstars and common to all three versions . The majority of the remaining songs in each version are exclusive to that version and performed by its featured idols , although there is also one exclusive song performed by 765 Pro Allstars in each version . An additional song , " The World is All One ! ! " , was available for download to players who purchased a first printing copy of the PSP games . Four songs were originally introduced in Shiny Festa : " Music " appears in all three versions , " Vault That Borderline ! " is featured in Honey Sound and Harmonic Score , " <unk> " is featured in Groovy Tune and Melodic Disc , and " Visionary " ( <unk> ) is featured in Funky Note and Rhythmic Record . 
 Unlike Shiny Festa , only the song " We Have a Dream " is initially playable in Shiny TV , and additional songs must be purchased as downloadable content . In addition to the songs originally contained in the Shiny Festa games , there are 14 extra songs available to download . Out of these , the song " <unk> Prince " ( <unk> ) was first introduced with the game , and it is made available to the player with the purchase of any mini album , while access to the songs " Arcadia " and " Sora " ( 空 ) are granted to players who purchased respectively the first and last six mini albums .

 The original PlayStation Portable ( PSP ) versions of the Shiny Festa games sold 119 @,@ 132 units in their first week of sales , and together ranked as the best @-@ selling video game in Japan that week . The PSP versions received a combined review score of 32 out of 40 from the Japanese video game magazine Famitsu . At the third Newtype Anime Awards in 2013 , Shiny Festa 's anime sequences received first place in the Game Animation category . Critics commonly agree that Shiny Festa , while it appeals to the franchise 's existing fans , is accessible and welcoming to new fans whose first exposure to the franchise is its anime adaptation . Japanator 's Jeff Chuang wrote that the game is " twice the fun " to fans of the franchise 's songs , while Elliot Gay , writing for the same website , argued that the games ' inclusion of anime material pointed to the game 's development as " fanservice for fans " . Reviewers also agreed that despite its simple gameplay , Shiny Festa still provides substantial challenge . Famitsu 's reviewers wrote that while the game has a simpler control scheme compared to other rhythm games , it becomes difficult when played on the Master difficulty . Gay and Chuang both agreed that the simple gameplay becomes appropriately difficult with the higher difficulties , while ASCII Media Works ' Lipton Kumada noted that the game becomes harder as variations such as simultaneous and long icons are added . 
 The iOS version 's improvements over the original PSP version were positively received . The website Famitsu App noted that the iOS version has shorter loading times and greater display resolution compared to the PSP version . Gay wrote that the iPhone 4 's Retina Display made the game look " a whole lot better than it did on the PSP or Vita " , while Kumada said he was stunned to see the iPhone 5 's more vibrant colors and lack of interlacing , despite its smaller screen compared to the PSP . At the same time , reviewers had mixed opinions regarding the iOS ' version 's control scheme . <unk> Matsumoto of 4Gamer appreciated the iOS version 's use of touch screen input , feeling that it simplified the controls and Gay felt the touch controls felt natural . In contrast , Famitsu App 's writer felt that it was easier to hold down notes with the PSP 's buttons , and Chuang said that playing on an iPad Mini felt less precise than on the PSP , but noted that the player can theoretically " hit the notes even faster " with a touch screen . Chuang also noted he occasionally opened the iOS version 's pause menu by accident due to the touch controls , and Matsumoto complained that the use of touch screen input meant that his fingers would be blocking his view . 
 Many journalists , particularly non @-@ Japanese press , reacted negatively toward the iOS version 's pricing in comparison to other games for the platform . Kotaku 's Mike Fahey described the games as " a tough sell " at US $ 54 @.@ 99 each and approximately $ 170 altogether in a market " dominated by free and $ .99 games " . Technology Tell 's Jenni Lada noted that the PSP version would be cheaper when imported , and criticized Bandai Namco Games for " setting [ the release ] up to fail " . Elliot Gay felt the games were expensive , but pointed out that it has " never been cheap to be " a fan of the franchise . Likewise , Kumada felt the iOS games were too expensive as mobile apps , but thought it was a " bit of a bargain " in comparison to the PSP versions ' full retail prices . 
 = Gyeongju = 
 Gyeongju ( Korean pronunciation : [ <unk> ] ) , historically known as " Seorabeol " , is a coastal city in the far southeastern corner of North Gyeongsang Province in South Korea . It is the second largest city by area in the province after Andong , covering 1 @,@ 324 km2 ( 511 sq mi ) with a population of 264 @,@ 091 people ( as of December 2012 . ) Gyeongju is 370 km ( 230 mi ) southeast of Seoul , and 55 km ( 34 mi ) east of the provincial capital , Daegu . The city borders Cheongdo and <unk> to the west , Ulsan to the south and Pohang to the north , while to the east lies the coast of the Sea of Japan ( East Sea ) . Numerous low mountains — outliers of the Taebaek range — are scattered around the city . 
 Gyeongju was the capital of the ancient kingdom of Silla ( 57 BC – 935 AD ) which ruled about two @-@ thirds of the Korean Peninsula between the 7th and 9th centuries . A vast number of archaeological sites and cultural properties from this period remain in the city . Gyeongju is often referred to as " the museum without walls " . Among such historical treasures , Seokguram grotto , Bulguksa temple , Gyeongju Historic Areas and <unk> Folk Village are designated as World Heritage Sites by UNESCO . The many major historical sites have helped Gyeongju become one of the most popular tourist destinations in South Korea . 
 The city of Gyeongju was united with the nearby rural Gyeongju County in 1995 and is now an urban – rural complex . It is similar to 53 other small- and medium @-@ sized cities with a population under 300 @,@ 000 people in South Korea . As well as its rich historical heritage , Gyeongju today is affected by the economic , demographic , and social trends that have shaped modern South Korean culture . Tourism remains the major economic driver , but manufacturing activities have developed due to its proximity to major industrial centers such as Ulsan and Pohang . Gyeongju is connected to the nationwide rail and highway networks , which facilitate industrial and tourist traffic . 
 = = History = = 
 The early history of Gyeongju is closely tied to that of the Silla kingdom , of which it was the capital . While being capital of Silla , Gyeongju was called Seorabeol . Gyeongju first enters non @-@ Korean records as Saro @-@ guk , during the Samhan period in the early Common Era . Korean records , probably based on the dynastic chronicles of Silla , record that Saro @-@ guk was established in 57 BCE , when six small villages in the Gyeongju area united under Bak <unk> . As the kingdom expanded , it changed its name to Silla . During the Silla period , the city was called " Seorabeol " ( lit . Capital ) , " <unk> " ( lit . Rooster 's forest ) or " <unk> " ( lit . City of Gold ) . 
 After the unification of the peninsula up to Taedong River in 668 AD , Gyeongju became the center of Korean political and cultural life . The city was home to the Silla court and the great majority of the kingdom 's elite . Its prosperity became legendary , and was reported as far away as Persia according to the 9th century book , The Book of Roads and Kingdoms . Records of Samguk Yusa give the city 's population in its peak period as 178 @,@ 936 households , suggesting that the total population was almost one million . Many of Gyeongju 's most famous sites date from this Unified Silla period , which ended in the late 9th century by Goryeo ( 918 – 1392 ) . 
 In 940 , the founder of Goryeo , King Taejo , changed the city 's name to " Gyeongju " , which literally means " <unk> district " . In 987 , as Goryeo adopted a system of having three additional capitals in politically important provinces outside <unk> ( nowadays Kaesong ) , Gyeongju was designated as " <unk> " ( " East Capital " ) . However , that title was removed in 1012 , the 3rd year of King <unk> , due to political rivalries at that time , though Gyeongju was later made the seat of Yeongnam Province . It had jurisdiction over a wide area , including much of east @-@ central Yeongnam , although this area was greatly reduced in the 13th century . Under the subsequent Joseon ( 1392 – 1910 ) dynasties , Gyeongju was no longer of national importance , but remained a regional center . In 1601 , the city ceased to be the provincial capital . 
 Over these centuries , the city 's relics suffered numerous assaults . In the 13th century , Mongol forces destroyed a nine @-@ story wooden pagoda at <unk> . During the Japanese invasions of Korea , the Gyeongju area became a heated battlefield , and Japanese forces burned the wooden structures at Bulguksa . Not all damage was due to invasions , however . In the early Joseon period , a great deal of damage was done to Buddhist sculptures on Namsan by Neo @-@ Confucian radicals , who hacked arms and heads off statuary . 
 In the 20th century , the city had remained relatively small , no longer ranking among the major cities of Korea . During the early 20th century , many archaeological excavations were conducted , particularly inside the tombs which had remained largely intact over the centuries . A museum , the forerunner of the present @-@ day Gyeongju National Museum , was inaugurated in 1915 to exhibit the excavated artifacts . 
 Gyeongju emerged as a railroad junction in the later years of the Japanese Occupation , as the Donghae Nambu Line and Jungang Line were established to prepare for Second Sino @-@ Japanese War and to exploit rich resources of the eastern Korean peninsula . Following liberation in 1945 , Korea was plunged into turmoil , and Gyeongju was no exception . Returnees from abroad were numerous ; a village for them was constructed in present @-@ day <unk> @-@ dong . In a period marked by widespread conflict and unrest , the Gyeongju area became particularly notorious for the level of guerrilla activity in the mountains . 
 Although the Korean War broke out in 1950 , most of Gyeongju was spared from the fighting , and remained under South Korean control throughout the conflict . However , for a brief time in late 1950 portions of the city stood on the front lines , as North Korean forces pushed the Pusan Perimeter southward from Pohang . 
 In the 1970s , Korea saw substantial industrial development , much of it centered in the Yeongnam region of which Gyeongju is a part . The <unk> steel mill in neighboring Pohang commenced operations in 1973 , and the chemical manufacturing complex in Ulsan emerged in the same year . These developments helped to support the emergence of Gyeongju 's manufacturing sector . 
 = = Geography and climate = = 
 Gyeongju lies in the southeastern corner of North Gyeongsang Province , and is bounded by the metropolitan city of Ulsan on the south . Within the province , its neighbors include Pohang on the north , Cheongdo County on the southwest , and <unk> on the northwest . Gyeongju is located about 50 kilometers ( 31 mi ) north of Busan . To the east , it has no neighbor but the sea . 
 Most of Gyeongju lies in the Gyeongsang Basin , but a few areas of the city belong to the Pohang Basin , such as <unk> @-@ ri and <unk> @-@ ri in <unk> @-@ myeon , and part of Cheonbuk @-@ myeon . The Gyeongsang Basin areas consist of Bulguksa intrusive rock penetrating layers of sedimentary rocks , mainly granite and porphyry . By contrast , the Pohang Basin areas are made up of stratum that formed in the Tertiary period of the Cenozoic era , which consist of igneous rock , aqueous rock , porphyry , sandstone , and tuff . 
 Low mountains are widespread throughout Gyeongju . The highest of these are the Taebaek Mountains , which run along the city 's western border . Gyeongju 's highest point , <unk> Mountain ( <unk> ) , is 1 @,@ 015 meters ( 3 @,@ 330 ft ) above sea level . This peak lies in <unk> @-@ myeon , on the border with Cheongdo . East of the Taebaek range , other western peaks such as <unk> Mountain lie within the <unk> subrange . The city 's eastern peaks , including <unk> Mountain , belong to the <unk> Mountains and Dongdae Mountains . 
 Gyeongju 's drainage patterns are shaped by these lines of mountains . The Dongdae Mountains divide a narrow foothills area on their east , and various internal river systems to the west . Most of the city 's interior is drained by the small Hyeongsan River , which flows north from Ulsan and meets the sea at Pohang Harbor . The Hyeongsan 's chief tributaries include the <unk> and <unk> , which join it in Gyeongju Basin . The southwestern corner of Gyeongju , on the far side of the Taebaek range , drains into the <unk> River , which then flows into the Nakdong . A small area of the south , just west of the Dongdae range , drains into the <unk> River , which flows into the Bay of Ulsan . 
 The Gyeongju coastline runs for 36 @.@ 1 kilometers ( 22 @.@ 4 mi ) between Pohang in the north and Ulsan in the south . There are no islands or large bays , only the small indentations made by the small streams flowing off the Dongdae ridgeline . Because of this , the city has no significant ports , though there are 12 small harbors . One such harbor in Gyeongju 's southeast corner is home to the Ulsan base of the National Maritime Police . This base is responsible for security over a wide area of South Korea 's east @-@ central coast . 
 = = = Climate = = = 
 Due to its coastal location , Gyeongju has a slightly milder and wetter climate than the more inland regions of Korea . In general , however , the city 's climate is typical of South Korea . It has hot summers and cool winters , with a monsoon season between late June and early August . As on the rest of Korea 's east coast , autumn typhoons are not uncommon . The average annual rainfall is 1 @,@ 091 millimeters ( 43 @.@ 0 in ) , and the average annual high temperatures range from 8 @.@ 6 – 31 @.@ 1 ° C ( 47 – 88 ° F ) . 
 Gyeongju 's historic city center lies on the banks of the Hyeongsan in Gyeongju Basin . This <unk> area has been subject to repeated flooding throughout recorded history , often as a result of typhoons . On average , chronicles report a major flood every 27 @.@ 9 years , beginning in the 1st century . Modern flood control mechanisms brought about a dramatic reduction in flooding in the later 20th century . The last major flood occurred in 1991 , when the <unk> Lake reservoir overflowed due to Typhoon Gladys . 
 = = Government = = 
 The executive branch of the government is headed by a mayor and vice @-@ mayor . As in other South Korean cities and counties , the mayor is elected directly , while the vice @-@ mayor is appointed . As of 2010 , the mayor is Choi Yang @-@ sik , who was appointed to the position on July 1 , 2010 after winning the local election held on June 2 of the same year . He is Gyeongju 's fifth mayor to be directly elected , the sixth to preside over the city in its present form , and the 31st mayor since 1955 . Like most heads of government in the Yeongnam region , he is a member of the conservative Grand National Party . 
 The legislative branch consists of the Gyeongju City Council , with 21 members as of 2009 . The present City Council was formed from the merger of the old Gyeongju City Council with the Wolseong County Council in 1991 . Most subdivisions of Gyeongju elect a single member to represent them in the Council , but Angang @-@ eup is represented by two members because of its large population , and two of the representatives serve combined districts composed of two dong . Like the mayor , the council members were last elected in 2006 , except for a small number elected in more recent by @-@ elections . 
 The central administration is composed of a City Council committee , five departments , two subsidiary organs , a chamber ( the auditor ) , and six business offices . The five departments are the departments of Planning and Culture , Autonomous Administration , Industry and Environment , Construction and Public Works , and the National Enterprise Committee ; these oversee a total of 29 subdivisions . The two subsidiary organs are the Health Care Center and Agro @-@ technology Center ; these belong directly to the central administration and have a total of 4 subdivisions . In addition , there are 23 local administrative subdivisions . Each of these subdivisions has a local office with a small administrative staff . As of December 2008 , the city government employed 1 @,@ 462 people . 
 = = Subdivisions = = 
 The city is divided into 23 administrative districts : 4 eup , 8 myeon , and 11 dong . These are the standard subdivisions of cities and counties in South Korea . The dong or neighborhood units occupy the area of the city center , which was formerly occupied by Gyeongju @-@ eup . <unk> are typically substantial villages , whereas myeon are more rural . 
 The city 's boundaries and designation changed several times in the 20th century . From 1895 to 1955 , the area was known as Gyeongju @-@ gun ( " Gyeongju County " ) . In the first decades of the century , the city center was known as Gyeongju @-@ myeon , signifying a relatively rural rea . In 1931 , the downtown area was designated Gyeongju @-@ eup , in recognition of its increasingly urban nature . In 1955 , Gyeongju @-@ eup became Gyeongju @-@ si ( " Gyeongju City " ) , the same name as today , but with a much smaller area . The remainder of Gyeongju @-@ gun became " Wolseong County . " The county and city were reunited in 1995 , creating Gyeongju City as we know it today . 
 = = Demographics = = 
 When the Silla kingdom reached the peak of its development , Gyeongju was estimated to have a million residents , four times the city 's population in 2008 . In recent years , Gyeongju has followed the same trends that have affected the rest of South Korea . Like the country as a whole , Gyeongju has seen its population age and the size of families shrink . For instance , the mean household size is 2 @.@ 8 people . Because this has fallen in recent years , there are more households in the city as of 2008 ( 105 @,@ 009 ) than there were in 2003 , even though the population has fallen . 
 Like most of South Korea 's smaller cities , Gyeongju has seen a steady drop in population in recent years . From 2002 to 2008 , the city lost 16 @,@ 557 people . This is primarily due to the migration of workers seeking employment in the major South Korean cities . In 2007 , about 1 @,@ 975 more people moved away from the city each year than moved in . During the same period , births exceeded deaths by roughly 450 per year , a significant number but not enough to offset the losses due to migration . 
 Gyeongju has a small but growing population of non @-@ Koreans . In 2007 , there were 4 @,@ 671 foreigners living in Gyeongju . This number corresponds to 1 @.@ 73 % of the total population , more than double the figure from 2003 . The growth was largely in immigrants from other Asian countries , many of whom are employed in the automotive parts industry . Countries of origin whose numbers have risen include the Philippines , China , Taiwan , Indonesia , and Vietnam . The number of residents from Japan , the United States , and Canada fell significantly in the 2003 – 2007 period . 
 = = = Dialect = = = 
 The city has a distinctive dialect which it shares with northern portions of Ulsan . This dialect is similar to the general Gyeongsang dialect , but retains distinctive features of its own . Some linguists have treated the distinctive characteristics of the Gyeongju dialect as vestiges of the Silla language . For instance , the contrast between the local dialect form " <unk> " ( <unk> ) and the standard " <unk> " ( <unk> , meaning " <unk> " ) has been seen as reflecting the ancient phonemic character of the Silla language . 
 = = Culture and people = = 
 = = = Cultural properties = = = 
 Gyeongju is the main destination in South Korea for visitors interested in the cultural heritage of Silla and the architecture of the Joseon Dynasty ( 1392 – 1910 ) . The city has 31 National Treasures , and Gyeongju National Museum houses 16 @,@ 333 artifacts . There are four broad categories of relics and historical sites : tumuli and their artifacts ; Buddhist sites and objects ; fortresses and palace sites ; and ancient architecture . Prehistoric remains including <unk> pottery have been excavated in central Gyeongju , in the Moa @-@ ri and Oya @-@ ri villages of the Cheonbuk @-@ myeon district , and in the <unk> @-@ ri village of the <unk> @-@ eup district . <unk> are found in several places , especially in Gangdong @-@ myeon and Moa @-@ ri . Bronze Age relics found in <unk> @-@ ri village of Gangdong @-@ myeon , <unk> @-@ ri and <unk> @-@ ri villages of <unk> @-@ eup and graveyards in the <unk> @-@ dong district represent the Samhan confederacy period of around the 1st century BC to the 3rd century AD . 
 There are 35 royal tombs and 155 tumuli in central Gyeongju , and 421 tumuli in the outskirts of the city . Silla burial mounds built after the period of the Three Kingdoms are found in central Gyeongju , including tumuli in the districts of <unk> @-@ dong , <unk> @-@ dong , <unk> @-@ dong , <unk> @-@ dong and <unk> @-@ dong . Western Gyeongju has the tomb of King <unk> in <unk> @-@ dong , nearby tumuli in <unk> @-@ dong and the tomb of Kim Yu @-@ sin . The tombs of Queen Seondeok , King Sinmun , King <unk> and King <unk> are at the base of Namsan mountain while the tombs of King <unk> , King <unk> , King <unk> and King <unk> are on the slopes of the mountain . In addition to the tombs , tumuli have been found surrounding Namsan mountain and in the western part of <unk> mountain . Artifacts excavated from the tombs of <unk> ( gold crown tomb ) , <unk> ( western phoenix tomb ) , <unk> ( heavenly horse tomb ) and northern and southern parts of Tomb No. 98 are good examples of Silla culture . 
 = = = Notable people = = = 
 Gyeongju has produced notable individuals throughout its history . As the capital of Silla , Gyeongju was a center of culture in its heyday . Notable Gyeongju residents in the Silla period included most of the kingdom 's leading figures , not only rulers but scholars such as <unk> Chong and Choe Chi @-@ won , and generals like Kim <unk> , the leader of the Hwarang warriors . The city continued to contribute to traditional Korean thought in subsequent dynasties . Relatives of Choe Chi @-@ won such as Choe Eon @-@ <unk> and Choe Hang played an important role in establishing the structures of early Goryeo . In the Joseon period , Gyeongju joined the rest of Gyeongsang in becoming a hotbed of the conservative Sarim faction . Notable Gyeongju members of this faction included the 15th century intellectual Yi Eon @-@ <unk> . He has been enshrined in the <unk> Seowon since 1572 . In modern times , the city produced writers such as Kim Dong @-@ ni and Park Mok @-@ <unk> , both of whom did a great deal to popularize the region 's culture , as well as Choe Jun , a wealthy businessman who established the <unk> University Foundation . 
 Some Korean family clans trace their origins to Gyeongju , often to the ruling elites of Silla . For example , the Gyeongju Kim clan claims descent from the rulers of later Silla . The Gyeongju Park and Gyeongju Seok clans trace their ancestry to Silla 's earlier ruling families . These three royal clans played a strong role in preserving the historical precincts of Gyeongju into modern times . The Gyeongju Choe and Lee clans also trace their ancestry to the Silla elites . Prominent members of the Gyeongju Lee clan include Goryeo period scholar Yi Je @-@ <unk> , and Joseon period scholars Yi Hwang and Yi Hang @-@ bok . A contemporary notable figure from the Gyeongju Lee clan is Lee Byung @-@ <unk> , the founder of Samsung Group . However , not all Gyeongju clans date to the Silla period ; for instance , the Gyeongju Bing clan was founded in the early Joseon Dynasty . 
 = = = Religion = = = 
 The city remains an important centre of Korean Buddhism . East of the downtown area lies Bulguksa , one of South Korea 's largest Buddhist temples ; nearby is Seokguram , a famed Buddhist shrine . Traditional prayer locations are found on mountains throughout Gyeongju . Such mountains include Namsan near the city center , <unk> @-@ san and Obong @-@ san in the west , and the low peak of <unk> @-@ san on the Gyeongju @-@ Pohang border . Namsan in particular is often referred to as " the sacred mountain " due to the Buddhist shrines and statues which cover its slopes . In addition , Gyeongju is the birthplace of <unk> , an indigenous religion to Korea based on Korean shamanism , Taoism and Korean Buddhism , with elements drawn from Christianity . The religion has been evolved from <unk> ( lit . East learning ) disciplines established by Choe Je @-@ u . His birthplace of <unk> , located in <unk> @-@ myeon , is regarded as a sacred place to followers of <unk> . 
 = = = Cuisine = = = 
 The cuisine of Gyeongju is generally typical of the cuisine elsewhere in Gyeongsang province : spicy and salty . However , it has distinctive tastes according to region and several local specialties known nationwide . The most famous of these is " Gyeongju bread " or " <unk> bread " , a red @-@ bean pastry first baked in 1939 and now sold throughout the country . <unk> , made with locally produced glutinous barley , is also a pastry with a filling of red bean paste . Local specialties with a somewhat longer pedigree include <unk> , a traditional Korean liquor produced by the Gyeongju Choe in Gyo @-@ dong . The brewing skill and distill master were designated as Important Intangible Cultural Properties by South Korea government . 
 Other local specialities include <unk> , haejangguk , and <unk> . <unk> refers to a rice dish served with vegetable leaves , various <unk> ( small side dishes ) and condiments such as gochujang ( chili pepper paste ) or <unk> ( a mixture of soybean paste and gochujang ) to wrap them together . Most <unk> restaurants in Gyeongju are gathered in the area of <unk> or Grand <unk> Park . <unk> is a kind of soup eaten as a hangover cure , and means " soup to chase a hangover " . A street dedicated to haejangguk is located near Gyeongju National Museum , where 20 haejangguk restaurants are gathered to serve the Gyeongju @-@ style haejangguk . The soup is made by boiling soybean sprout , sliced <unk> ( buckwheat starch jelly ) , sour kimchi ( pickled vegetables ) and <unk> in a clear broth of dried anchovy and Alaska <unk> . 
 The east district of Gyeongju , Gampo @-@ eup town , is adjacent to the sea , so fresh seafood and <unk> ( fermented salted seafood ) are abundant . There are over 240 seafood restaurants in Gampo Harbor offering various dishes made with seafood caught in the sea , such as hoe ( raw fish dishes ) , <unk> ( an abalone soup ) , grilled seafood and others . 
 = = Sports = = 
 As of 2007 , Gyeongju city had two stadiums , two gymnasiums , two tennis courts , one swimming pool and others as public sport facilities as well as various registered private sports venues . Many of public sport facilities are located in <unk> Park with an area of 1 @,@ 022 @,@ 350 m2 ( 11 @,@ 004 @,@ 500 sq ft ) including a luxuriant pine trees forest . The site was originally the location of the artificial forest of <unk> which was established for feng shui purposes during the Silla period . It was also used as a training ground for <unk> warriors and hunting spot for Silla kings , and was reported to be King <unk> 's favorite location . Since 1975 , <unk> Park has been designated as " city neighborhood park " and currently consists of multi @-@ purposed Gyeongju Public Stadium , Football Park with 7 football fields and one futsal field , and one gymnasium , as well as <unk> field for <unk> or Korean traditional archery and a <unk> wrestling ring . In addition , it contains a <unk> field , an inline skating rink , jogging courses , and cycling roads . The Gyeongju Public Stadium was completed in 1982 and can accommodate 20 @,@ 000 people at capacity . 
 Angang Field Hockey Stadium , located in the district of Angang @-@ eup , is home to Gyeongju City Hockey , which is one of four professional women 's field hockey teams in South Korea . The team was formed in 1994 , and is governed by the Sport and Youth Division of Gyeongju City . Although not an initial successful team , Gyeongju City Hockey won the first trophies both at National Division Hockey Championships and National Sports Festival in 2000 . In 2002 , Gyeongju City Hockey took a first prize and three second prizes , and in 2008 , the team won the first prize at the 51st National Division Hockey Championships . 
 The city plays host to two annual marathon events . The Gyeongju International Marathon , held in October , garners elite level competition while the larger Gyeongju Cherry Blossom Marathon caters more for amateur fun runners . The Cherry Blossom Marathon has been held each year in Gyeongju since 1992 , usually in April , to improve relations with Japan ( a country with a long history of marathon running ) . The race , mainly sponsored by Gyeongju city and the district , attracted 13 @,@ 600 participants in 2009 including about 1 @,@ 600 foreigners . 
 = = Economy = = 
 The economy of Gyeongju is more diverse than the city 's image as a tourist haven would suggest . Although tourism is important to the economy , most residents work in other fields . Over 27 @,@ 000 are employed in manufacturing compared to roughly 13 @,@ 500 in the hospitality industry . The number involved in tourism has remained constant over recent years , while the manufacturing sector added about 6 @,@ 000 jobs from 1999 to 2003 . The manufacturing sector is closely tied to nearby cities , utilizing Gyeongju 's transit links with Ulsan , Pohang , and Daegu . As in Ulsan and Daegu the automotive parts industry plays an important role . Of the 1 @,@ 221 businesses incorporated in Gyeongju almost a third are involved in auto @-@ parts manufacture . 
 Fishing takes place in coastal towns , especially in Gampo @-@ eup in the city 's northeast , with 436 registered fishing craft in the city . Fishing industry in Gyeongju is generally in a declined status due to relatively inconvenient transport conditions and lacks of subordinate facilities . Much of the catch from these boats goes direct from the harbor to Gyeongju 's many seafood restaurants . Mainly , sauries , anchovies , rays are harvested and a small number of abalone and <unk> farming takes place . Local specialties include <unk> ( fermented anchovy ) , abalone , <unk> , and squid . 
 Agriculture is still important , particularly in the outlying regions of Gyeongju . According to the 2006 statistical yearbook of Gyeongju , rice fields occupy an area of 169 @.@ 57 km2 ( 65 @.@ 47 sq mi ) , which is 70 % of the total cultivated acreage of 24 @,@ 359 km2 ( 9 @,@ 405 sq mi ) . The remaining 74 @.@ 02 km2 ( 28 @.@ 58 sq mi ) consists of fields under other crops and farmsteads . Crop production is centered in the fertile river basins near the Hyeongsan River . The main crops are rice , barley , beans and corn . Vegetables such as daikon and <unk> cabbage and fruits are also important crops . Apples are mainly produced in the districts of Geoncheon @-@ eup , Gangdong @-@ myeon and Cheonbuk @-@ myeon and Korean pear are cultivated in Geoncheon @-@ eup and Angang @-@ eup . The city plays a leading role in the domestic production of beef and mushrooms . Button mushrooms harvested in Geoncheon @-@ eup are canned and exported . The cultivated acreage and the number of households engaging in agriculture is however declining . 
 A small amount of quarrying activity takes place in the city , with 46 active mines and quarries in Gyeongju . Most are engaged in the extraction of kaolin , fluorspar and <unk> and <unk> is exported . 
 As the capital of Silla , commerce and trading in Gyeongju developed early on . Samguk Sagi has records on the establishment of <unk> ( capital area market ) in March , 490 during King <unk> 's reign , and <unk> ( East Market ) in 509 , during King <unk> 's reign . In the 1830s , Gyeongju had five five @-@ day markets which remained very active until the late 1920s . Due to its size Gyeongju <unk> ( Gyeongju village market ) was referred to as one of the two leading markets in the Yeongnam area , along with Daegu <unk> . Transportation developed in the late period of the Japanese occupation , as the Jungang Line and the Daegu Line and the connecting route between Pohang and the northwestern part of Japan were set up , leading to increasing population and developing commerce . After the 1960s , traditional periodic markets gradually transformed into regular markets as the city was flourishing . In periodic markets , agricultural and marine products , industrial products , living necessaries , wild edible greens , herbs , and cattle are mainly traded . As of 2006 , Gyeongju had eight regular markets , nine periodic markets and the Gyeongju department store . Traditional periodic markets declined and have become token affairs these days . 
 = = = Tourism = = = 
 Gyeongju is a major tourist destination for South Koreans as well as foreign visitors . It boasts the 1000 years of Silla heritage with vast number of ancient ruins and archaeological sites found throughout the city , which help to attract 6 million visiting tourists including 750 @,@ 000 foreigners per year . The city government has parlayed its historic status into a basis for other tourism @-@ related developments such as conferences , festivals , and resorts . 
 Many Silla sites are located in Gyeongju National Park such as the Royal Tomb Complex , the <unk> observatory that is one of the oldest surviving astronomical observatories in East Asia , the <unk> royal pond garden , and the <unk> forest . Gyeongju National Museum hosts many important artifacts and national treasures that have been excavated from sites within the city and surrounding areas . 
 Much of Gyeongju 's heritage are related to the Silla kingdom 's patronage of Buddhism . The grotto of Seokguram and the temple of Bulguksa were the first Korean sites to be included on the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1995 . In addition , the ruins of the old <unk> temple , said to have been Korean 's largest , are preserved on the slopes of <unk> Mountain . Various Silla @-@ era stone carvings of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas are found on mountainsides throughout the city , particularly on Namsan . 
 A significant portion of Gyeongju 's tourist traffic is due to the city 's promotion of itself as a site for various festivals , conferences , and competitions . Every year since 1962 , the Silla cultural festival has been held in October to celebrate and honour the dynasty 's history and culture . It is one of the major festivals of Korea . It features athletic events , folk games , music , dance , literary contests and Buddhist religious ceremonies . Other festivals include the Cherry Blossom Marathon in April , the Korean Traditional Liquor and Cake festival in March , and memorial ceremonies for the founders of the Silla Dynasty and General Kim Yu @-@ sin . 
 There were 15 hotels including Hilton Hotel , <unk> <unk> Hotel , and 276 lodging facilities , and 2 @,@ 817 restaurants in Gyeongju in 2006 . 
 = = Media = = 
 Gyeongju has two main local newspapers ; the Gyeongju Sinmun and the Seorabeol Sinmun . Both are weekly newspapers providing news via online as well and their headquarters are located in the neighborhood of <unk> @-@ dong . The Gyeongju Sinmun was founded in 1989 and provides various news and critics on anything concerning Gyeongju . Its online newspaper , Digital Gyeongju Sinmun opened in December , 2000 to provide live local news out of the limit as a weekly newspaper and to establish mutual information exchanges from Gyeongju locals . In 2001 , Gyeongju Sinmun started to present Gyeongju Citizen Awards to people who try to develop the local industry and economy , culture and education , and welfare service . Since 2003 , the Wolseong Nuclear Power Plant headquarter co @-@ hosts the awards with Gyeongju Sinmun . 
 The Seorabeol Sinmun was established in 1993 , however , from November 15 , 2000 to November 10 , 2005 , its publication was stopped for financial difficulties after the 1997 Asian economic crisis had left a strong impact on the nationwide economy . Since 2006 , Seorabeol Sinmun presents <unk> Awards to people having devouring to develop Gyeongju . 
 Several major feature films have been filmed in the city , including Kick the Moon , On the Occasion of Remembering the Turning Gate , <unk> , <unk> and others . In 2009 , the filming of the Queen Seondeok , a popular MBC TV series took place in a studio at Silla Millennium Park located in <unk> Lake Resort . 
 = = Education = = 
 Gyeongju is strongly associated with the education tradition of <unk> ( " Way of the Flower of Young Men " ) which was established and flourished during the Silla period . It is a military and philosophical code that offered the basis of training to Hwarang , a military cadet of youths from the aristocratic class . The training equally emphasized practicing academic and martial arts based on Buddhism and patriotism . A number of Silla 's greatest generals and military leaders such as Kim Yu @-@ sin were Hwarang who played a central role in Silla unification of the Korean peninsula . As Silla was integrated into the next ruling dynasty , Goryeo , the system declined and was officially disbanded in the Joseon dynasty . However , the spirit and discipline were revived in the second half of the 20th century as a form of Korean martial arts with the same name . 
 Formal education has a longer history in Gyeongju than anywhere else in South Korea . The <unk> , or national academy , was established here in 682 , at the beginning of the Unified Silla period . Its curriculum focused on the Confucian classics for local officials . After the fall of Silla in the 10th century , the <unk> closed . However , due to Gyeongju 's role as a provincial center under the Goryeo and early Joseon dynasties , the city was home to state @-@ sponsored provincial schools ( <unk> ) under both dynasties such as Gyeongju <unk> . During the later Joseon dynasty there were several <unk> , or private Confucian academies , were set up in the city such as <unk> Seowon and <unk> Seowon . 
 The education system of Gyeongju is the same as elsewhere in the country . Schooling begins with preschools ; there are 65 in the city . This is followed by six years in elementary schools ; Gyeongju has 46 . Subsequently students pass through three years of middle school . There are 19 middle schools in Gyeongju . High school education , which lasts for three years , is not compulsory , but most students attend and graduate from high school . Gyeongju is home to 21 high schools , of which 11 provide specialized technical training . At each of these levels , there is a mix of public and private institutions . All are overseen by the Gyeongju bureau of North Gyeongsang 's Provincial Office of Education . Gyeongju is home to a school for the mentally disabled , which provides education to students from preschool to adult age . 
 Gyeongju is home to four institutions of tertiary education . <unk> College is a technical college in the district of <unk> @-@ dong that offers majors specializing in tourism , leisure , health care and cosmetic treatments . 
 Each of Gyeongju 's three universities reflects the city 's unique role . Dongguk and <unk> universities are Buddhist institutions , reflecting that religion 's link to the city . Gyeongju University , formerly Korea Tourism University , is strongly focused on tourism , reflecting its importance in the region .

 According to the 2008 yearbook of Gyeongju , the total number of medical institutions was 224 with 3 @,@ 345 beds , including two general hospitals , thirteen hospitals , 109 clinics , five nursing homes , forty two dental hospitals , two Korean traditional medicine hospitals and 50 Korean traditional medicine clinics . There are also twenty eight medical institutions related to Gyeongju Health Center affiliated to the Gyeongju City government . 
 The two general hospitals are associated with two major universities in Gyeongju and nearby Daegu . One is the Dongguk University Gyeongju Hospital , located in the district of <unk> @-@ dong , which is affiliated with Dongguk University Medical School and Center . The Gyeongju Hospital was opened in a seven @-@ story building in 1991 to provide Gyeongju locals with a quality medical service and train medical specialists in the region . After various renovations the hospital currently has 24 departments including a radiation oncology center and 438 beds . It is also assigned as a teaching and learning hospital and in partnership with Dongguk University Oriental Hospital . The other general hospital is a branch of <unk> University , <unk> Medical Hospital in Daegu . It is the successor of Gyeongju Christianity Hospital founded in 1962 , and was reborn as the current general hospital in 1991 . The Gyeongju <unk> Hospital is located in the district of <unk> @-@ dong and has 12 departments in a three @-@ story building . 
 = = = Utilities = = = 
 Water supply and sewage disposal are municipal services which are respectively handled by the Water Supply Office and Water Quality and Environment Office . Water comes from the Hyeongsan River , the multi @-@ purpose <unk> Dam and several streams . The city is divided into seven water districts , with eight filtration plants and seven sewage treatment plants . One of the sewage treatment plants , Angang Sewage Disposal Plant began operating in April 2005 by the co @-@ investment of the Government of North Gyeongsang and Gyeongju City with a fund of 44 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 won to install facilities to prevent the pollution of the Hyeongsan River , which is a main water source for Gyeongju and Pohang residents . The plant is located on a spacious site with 39 @,@ 000 m2 ( 420 @,@ 000 sq ft ) in <unk> @-@ ri , Gangdong @-@ myeon in Gyeongju where nature friendly facilities provide recreational venues for the locals . Through 56 @.@ 1 km ( 34 @.@ 9 mi ) of sewer pipes and 14 pumping stations , the plant has a capacity of 18 @,@ 000 tonnes of domestic sewage per day that comes from Angang @-@ eup , and Gangdong @-@ myeon . The facilities have high @-@ powered disposal equipment developed by related industrial companies to maintain the discharged water at the first or second degree in quality , so that it is used as river maintenance flow and agricultural water in case a drought occurs . 
 The city had managed its own recycling service , but privatized it since July 1 , 2009 . 
 Other utilities are provided by private entities or South Korean government @-@ owned companies . Seorabeol City Gas , an affiliate of GS Group , provides gas to the Gyeongju residents , while , electrical power is supplied by the public enterprises , Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power via the Wolseong Nuclear Power Plant . The plant is known for the only nuclear power plant operating PHWRs ( Pressurized Heavy Water Reactor ) in South Korea and supplies about 5 % of South Korea 's electricity . The owner , Korea Hydro & Nuclear Power began to build the Wolseong 1 in the districts of <unk> @-@ myeon , <unk> @-@ myeon and Gampo @-@ eup in 1976 . Since 1983 , the power plant has been providing commercial service and operating with the PHWRs that has a capacity of 678 @,@ 000 kW . As the construction of each Wolseong 2 , 3 and 4 with a capacity of 70 @,@ 000 kW were completed respectively in 1997 , 1998 and 1999 , Wolseong Nuclear Power plant site has been successfully operating the four PHWRs plants .

 The city lies at the junction of two minor lines operated by the Korean National Railroad . The Jungang Line runs from Seoul to Gyeongju and carries trains from the Daegu Line , which originates in <unk> . In Gyeongju , the Jungang line connects to the Donghae Nambu Line which runs between Pohang and Busan . The <unk> Expressway , which runs from Seoul to Busan , passes through Gyeongju , and Provincial highway 68 , aided by the South Korean government , connects <unk> in the South Chungcheong province to Gyeongju . Additionally national highways such as Route 4 , 7 , 14 , 20 , 28 , 31 , and 35 crisscross the city . Since the city is a popular tourist destination , nonstop bus services are available from most major cities in South Korea .

 = AnsaldoBreda Driverless Metro = 
 The AnsaldoBreda <unk> STS Driverless Metro is a class of driverless electric multiple units and corresponding signaling system . Manufactured by AnsaldoBreda and Ansaldo STS in Italy , it is or will be used on the Copenhagen Metro , Princess Nora bint Abdul Rahman University , the Brescia Metro , the Thessaloniki Metro , Line 5 of the Milan Metro , Line C of the Rome Metro and the Yellow Line of the Taipei Rapid Transit System . The first system to use this class of driverless electric multiple units was the Copenhagen Metro which opened in 2002 . 
 The rolling stock consists of two to six articulated cars . All trains are 2 @.@ 65 meters ( 8 @.@ 7 ft ) wide , except those used on the Rome Metro which are 2 @.@ 85 meters ( 9 @.@ 4 ft ) wide . All operate on standard gauge . Each car has a power output of 210 or 256 kilowatts ( 282 or 343 hp ) , fed from a third rail at 750 volts ( except in Rome where it is 1 @,@ 500 V overhead line ) . The systems are fully automated , consisting of automatic train protection ( ATP ) , automatic train operation ( ATO ) and automatic train supervision . 
 = = Rolling stock = = 
 The rolling stock uses standardized car bodies , articulated together . The number of cars varies across the different systems where they are used . The trains used on the Princess Nora bint Abdul Rahman University system are two car units . For the other systems , the units vary between three and six cars , making the trains from 39 to 109 meters ( 128 to 358 ft ) long . They are 2 @.@ 65 meters ( 8 @.@ 7 ft ) wide , except the Rome Metro units , which are 2 @.@ 85 meters ( 9 @.@ 4 ft ) . The units vary from 3 @.@ 4 to 3 @.@ 85 meters ( 11 ft 2 in to 12 ft 8 in ) tall . Each car has two doors on each side , which are 1 @.@ 3 meters ( 4 ft 3 in ) wide and 1 @.@ 945 meters ( 6 ft 4 @.@ 6 in ) tall . The vehicles are designed by Giugiaro Design . 
 The three and four @-@ car trains have six three @-@ phase asynchronous motors per train , with each motor giving a power output of 105 and 128 kilowatts ( 141 and 172 hp ) , giving each train a power output of 630 or 764 kilowatts ( 845 or 1 @,@ 025 hp ) . In each car , the two motors are fed by the car 's own insulated @-@ gate bipolar transistor . They transform the 750 @-@ volt ( 1 @,@ 500 V in Rome ) direct current collected from the third rail shoe to the three @-@ phase alternating current used in the motors . The trains ' top speeds are 80 or 90 km / h ( 50 or 56 mph ) , with an acceleration and deceleration capacity of 1 @.@ 3 m / s2 ( 4 @.@ 3 ft / s2 ) . Trains are fully compatible with platform screen doors , which are found at all stations in Brescia , Rome and Milan , and at underground stations in Copenhagen . 
 = = Automation = = 
 The systems are controlled by a fully automated computer system , located at the control and maintenance center . The automatic train control ( ATC ) consists of three subsystems : automatic train protection ( ATP ) , automatic train operation ( ATO ) and automatic train supervision ( ATS ) . The ATP is responsible for managing the trains ' speed , insuring that doors are closed before departure and insuring that switches are correctly set . The system uses fixed block signaling , except around stations , where moving block signaling is used . The system has been designed and built by Union Switch & Signal . 
 The ATO is the autopilot that drives the trains in line with a pre @-@ defined schedule , ensures that the train stop at stations and operates the doors . The ATS monitors all components of the network , including the rails and all trains on the system , and displays a live schematic at the control center . The ATC is designed so that only the ATP is safety @-@ critical , and will halt trains if the other systems have faults . Other aspects of the system , such a power supply , ventilation , security alarms , cameras and pumps , are controlled by a system called " control , regulating and surveillance " . 
 The most common repairs are the grinding of the wheels ; more complicated repairs are made by replacing entire components that are sent to the manufacturer . By having components in reserve , trains can have shorter maintenance times . The center also has the system 's work trains , including a diesel locomotive that can fetch broken trains . At any time , there are four people working at the control center . Two monitor the ATC system , one monitors passenger information , while the last is responsible for secondary systems , such as power supply . In case of technical problems , there is always a team of technicians who can be sent to perform repairs . Although the trains are not equipped with drivers , there are stewards that help passengers , perform ticket controls and assist in emergency situations .

 20th Century Fox Television and Imagine TV were the production companies for the show that eventually became The Playboy Club . They had previously attempted to produce the concept during the 2010 – 11 television season but the project never came to fruition . After that initial attempt , the companies approached screenwriter Chad Hodge , who became the show 's creator and an executive producer . Imagine co @-@ founder Brian Grazer and president Francie Calfo also served as executive producers , as did Richard Rosenzweig , a longtime executive and consultant with Playboy Enterprises . Alta Loma Entertainment , Playboy 's entertainment production arm , received copies of all the story outlines and scripts for review but , according to Hodge , took a very hands @-@ off approach and did not get heavily involved in the creative process . Likewise , Playboy Enterprises founder Hugh Hefner reviewed each of the scripts personally , but did not provide much direct input or request major changes . The original title of the series was Bunny Tales , then Playboy , before the final title The Playboy Club was chosen . The show 's pilot script was the first new drama series ordered by NBC for the 2011 – 12 television season . 
 = = = Casting = = = 
 The main cast includes Eddie Cibrian , who was cast as Nick Dalton , the central character in the series . In an interview with The Hollywood Reporter , Cibrian stated that Dalton was a " chameleon " and very charismatic . He continued : " On the facade , he seems to have it all . He 's very successful . He 's dating the head Playboy bunny . He 's one of the first <unk> at the Playboy Club , but he has a very mysterious past . " Jeff Hephner was originally approached for the role after performing well in test auditions , but Hephner had no prior experience playing a television lead before , and the producers decided to let him go after the full cast table . Cibrian was cast just a few days before filming began . Amber Heard was approached by producers of the show to portray Bunny Maureen . Although the series premiere started with Nick helping Maureen out of a difficult situation , Heard said of the character , " Don 't underestimate that character and her intelligence , and the journey that she 's going to take to really rise above that . [ ... ] I think Maureen allows herself to be helped when she needs it , and by no means relies on any character , male or female , in this story , and never has . " 
 Producers of the show cast Naturi Naughton as Bunny Brenda . Naughton auditioned four times for the role before getting cast , singing the Nat King Cole song " When I Fall in Love " during one of the auditions . In researching the role , Naughton consulted the black former Playboy Bunny Pat Lacey , watched the documentary film The Bunny Years ( 1999 ) and read the book 50 Years of the Playboy Bunny . Brenda was loosely based on the model Jennifer Jackson , the actual first Black Playmate of the Month , although neither Naughton nor the Playboy Club producers contacted Jackson in preparing the role . Providing the role of the manager of the Playboy Club , Billy Rosen , David Krumholtz exclaimed that he was drawn to the character and wished to play a role different from Charlie Eppes , the character he played for six seasons on the crime drama Numb3rs . Other members of the main cast include Jenna Dewan , Laura Benanti , Leah Renee , Wes Ramsey , and Sean Maher . Hugh Hefner performed a brief voice @-@ over narration during the pilot episode .

 Principal photography for the episode took place in Chicago , Illinois , the same city where the story was set . Filming on the pilot episode began on March 15 , 2011 , with most scenes filmed on a set at Cinespace Studios on West 16th Street . Some scenes were also shot at the former Meigs Field on Northerly Island . 
 The pilot episode was heavily promoted in the weeks leading up to its airing . Laura Benanti appeared on a retro style cover of Playboy magazine released on September 16 , 2011 . The magazine had a 1961 theme , which included an old @-@ fashioned visual style , photos of 1960s Playboy bunnies and clubs , and the same sixty cent price as that time period . Benanti wore a black bunny costume and held a tray with drinks on the cover photo . NBC also entered into a cross @-@ promotional deal with the Bloomingdale 's department store . The Walton Street store in Chicago included display windows inspired by the series , which were unveiled in September 2011 by Benanti , as well as Naturi Naughton and Wes Ramsey . Chosen for the storefronts due to its close proximity to the original Playboy Club , the Walton Street store allowed visitors to take virtual photos with the show 's stars , view photos of the real @-@ life clubs and the show 's set , and enter into a contest to win such prizes as a walk @-@ on role on the show and a $ 5 @,@ 000 Bloomingdale 's shopping spree .

 The series premiere of The Playboy Club was initially broadcast on September 19 , 2011 in the United States on NBC . It was watched by 5 @.@ 02 million viewers , despite airing simultaneously with Hawaii Five @-@ 0 on CBS and Castle on ABC . That was the lowest viewership among the major networks in its 10 p.m. timeslot , with Castle drawing 13 @.@ 28 million households and Hawaii Five @-@ 0 attaining 12 @.@ 19 million households . The episode gradually shed viewers from the first half to the next , with an average of 5 @.@ 36 million households tuning in for the first half @-@ hour and an average of 4 @.@ 69 million households for the second . The debut earned a 1 @.@ 6 rating / 4 share among viewers in the 18 @-@ 49 demographic , according to the Nielson ratings , indicating it was viewed by four percent of those in the demographic who were actively watching television during the broadcast , which represented 1 @.@ 6 percent of the total demographic . This was considered a disappointing result for a coveted demographic . Speculations regarding the possible cancelation of the series immediately surfaced , but NBC officials told Deadline.com that such a decision would not be rushed because NBC Chairman Bob Greenblatt wanted to send a message that the network was willing to give all their new shows the necessary time to find an audience and succeed . Similarly in Canada , the pilot episode was viewed by 485 @,@ 000 viewers . 
 = = = Critical response = = = 
 Critics were generally unimpressed with the series premiere . Mike Hale of the New York Times critically panned the episode , writing , " An interesting drama could be made about Mr. Hefner 's success in fusing sex , privilege and pseudo @-@ cool into a wildly successful commercial empire during a conservative time , but The Playboy Club sets out to do much less , and succeeds . " Similarly , Seth Amitin of IGN gave the episode a 4 @.@ 5 out of ten , signifying a " bad " rating . Amitin stated that he was disappointed with its delivery , opining that while there were some potential in the show , it would " take a lot more work to get this show off the ground . " Meredith Blake of The A.V. Club reacted mildly to the episode , expressing that it was " glossy " but dull and mediocre . Fellow writer Phil Nugent echoed similar sentiments , writing , " The only outrageous thing about The Playboy Club is the scale of its miscalculated reverence for the sanctimonious mythology it 's trying to peddle . " In conclusion , Blake and Nugent gave the episode a ' C ' grade . 
 NPR writer Linda Holmes challenged the show 's assertions of female empowerment . Finding the episode itself " silly and full of bad dialogue " and " cheesy more than offensive " , Holmes questioned how a series about women whose conduct and appearance were micromanaged could simultaneously claim that those regimented women were uniformly empowered by the experience . She opined that " you can shake a Bunny tail and be empowered , no argument . It depends on what 's going on in the rest of your life . But shaking a Bunny tail isn 't enough to demonstrate empowerment if you have to go to Eddie Cibrian or Hugh Hefner for help every time you have a problem , and having the right not to be slapped on the behind when you deliver a cocktail isn 't exactly a societal advance on the order of universal suffrage . " The series , she concluded , might have been better served had those involved positioned it as a camp soap opera and not tried to make a feminist statement . In concurrence , Nancy Franklin of The New Yorker criticized Hefner 's narration , deeming it as delusional and stupid , and criticize the series for its stance on feminism . She wrote , " The show wants things both ways : to glamorize the Playboy ' lifestyle ' from a male point of view and also to try to persuade us that , although <unk> had its hardships and rigors — no gum chewing , constant smiling — wearing an uncomfortable skimpy uniform and putting a <unk> fake tail on your butt meant you held the keys to the universe . " Television Blend 's Kelly West was much more optimistic about the episode , and asserted that " The Playboy Club offers a lot of shiny things to look at , but beyond that , there is a story beginning to develop and characters that , while not quite as original as they are nice to look at , are interesting and charismatic enough to carry the series . " Tim Goodman of The Hollywood Reporter said the Playboy brand and the lifestyle portrayed in the series was dated and <unk> calling it a " bad show , period . The writing was weak , the acting spotty and the sexism too ridiculous and obvious to comment on more than once . " Alan Pergament , former critic for The Buffalo News , said of the show that " the truth is [ The Playboy Club ] should have been a pay @-@ cable series because without the sex it is pretty boring and tame . " 
 Several critics drew comparison to the television series Mad Men . Entertainment Weekly writer Margaret Lyons opined that the episode blatantly mimicked the show 's style , and called Eddie Cibrian 's performance an imitation of Jon Hamm 's Don Draper and even citing specific shots and camera angles similar to those in Mad Men . Lyons wrote , " [ The Playboy Club ] can 't copy the lyricism or narrative potency that make Mad Men what it is , which is more than a collection of artfully arranged period hairdos and moody pairs of people in front of rectangle @-@ patterned backgrounds . [ But ] it 's sure trying ! " TVLine 's Matt Webb Mitovich felt that despite evoking an accurate depiction of the 1960s , it did not succeed as well as Mad Men . He felt the series was too claustrophobic and that Cibrian was not strong enough for his part . 
 = ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron = 
 ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron is a platform video game developed by Johnson Voorsanger Productions and published by Sega in 1993 for the Sega Genesis . The game is the sequel to cult video game ToeJam & Earl , released in 1991 . The game concerns two alien protagonists , ToeJam and Earl , both of whom have escaped from Earth , where they had crash landed . After returning to their home planet of Funkotron , the duo discover a number of antagonistic Earthlings have stowed away on the spacecraft and are wreaking havoc across the planet . The player must hunt down these Earthlings and imprison them in jars before sending them back to Earth . 
 The game 's platform format was a departure from the original ToeJam & Earl , a treasure hunt game with randomly generated levels , inspired by the game Rogue . Creators Greg Johnson and Mark Voorsanger originally began designing a game built on the concepts of the original , but changed to a more generic type of game due to a lack of support for their vision on the part of Sega . The game was critically well received , with reviewers praising the graphics , soundtrack , fluid action and two @-@ player mode . It was also a commercial success , but fans of ToeJam & Earl were disappointed and confused by the radical change in direction . 
 Since its release ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron has been criticized for being too sharp a departure from the first game , and some later reviewers felt that the developers had been more interested in the publisher 's wishes than the fans . Johnson and Voorsanger have stated they regret moving away from their prototype sequel in the vein of ToeJam & Earl . Research has suggested that a significant minority of fans favor ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron as the best in the series . Together with its predecessor , the game comprises one of the Mega Drive 's " key exclusive franchises " , which eventually spawned a third installment in 2002 , albeit a commercial failure with mixed reviews . ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron was re @-@ released in 2007 for the Wii 's Virtual Console , receiving mixed reviews . The game was released on PlayStation Network and Xbox Live Arcade alongside its prequel in November 2012 . In August 2014 , ToeJam Earl 2 was listed on GamesRadar at # 10 on " Best Sega Genesis / Mega Drive games of all time " . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The game follows on the events of the first game , in which funky aliens ToeJam and Earl crash landed on Earth . After managing to rebuild their spaceship and returning safely to their home planet of Funkotron , the duo soon learn that a bunch of Earthlings had stowed away on their craft and have now invaded Funkotron . With the humans spreading panic across the planet 's citizens , even scaring the source of all funk , Lamont the <unk> , away to another dimension , it is up to ToeJam and Earl to clean up the mess they 've made and send all the Earthlings they brought with them back to where they came from . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Unlike its predecessor , Panic on Funkotron is a side @-@ scrolling platform game in which up to two players play as ToeJam and Earl as they travel across Funkotron to capture antagonistic Earthlings that had stowed away . Players accomplish this by using a radar to locate an Earthling 's proximity ( some Earthlings may be hidden in the environment ) and attack them with jars in order to trap and collect them . Once all Earthlings have been found , the player can move on to the next level . Players can collect presents containing various bonuses , such as super jars , radar scans , and teleporting moves . Coins can be used with parking meters to trigger events in the environment or participate in minigames such as Jam Outs and Fungus Olympics . Players can also enter gateways leading to the Hyper Funk Zone , where the player must avoid obstacles in order to earn more presents . Hidden throughout the game are ten objects belonging to Lamont the <unk> ; collecting all of which will earn the player the best ending upon completion .

 The game is the sequel to ToeJam & Earl , a treasure hunt game inspired by computer game Rogue and featuring randomly generated levels . After the success of the original game , Johnson Voorsanger Productions began work on a sequel in 1992 . The developer spent three to four months building on the original mechanics , adding elements such as indoor areas and additional terrain types , though the randomly generated levels were removed . The plot of this prototype would see ToeJam and Earl " return to Earth to stage a rap concert , only to find they 've lost their CDs " which would form the basis of the game 's treasure hunt . According to the Johnson and Voorsanger , the game would feature " more default items " for the characters to " use all the time " , new items and characters , and more detail and secret areas allowed by the fixed ( rather than randomly generated ) levels . The game employed a larger development team than the first installment and was originally projected for a Christmas 1992 release , and titled ToeJam & Earl 2 . Sega however conferred that they did not " understand " the game and though the " decision was still ultimately with Johnson and Voorsanger " , the developer started work on a more generic side @-@ scrolling platform game , a concept to which Sega had been more receptive . The increased size of the game 's cartridge over the original allowed for greater graphical detail . The soundtrack , including the original theme , was remixed and given a more layered quality . 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 The game was met with considerable anticipation , positive reviews and commercial success according to IGN , with GamaSutra also recalling a positive critical reaction . A contemporary review in the Chicago Tribune called it a " beautifully designed game " , as well as praising the Herbie Hancock @-@ inspired soundtrack and non @-@ violent action . The Washington Times also gave a positive verdict , stating : " This is one of the funniest games we 've ever seen . The graphics are superb , and the action and control are flawless . " Business Week wrote that " Sega knows what the kids find cool " with reference to the game . Mega placed the game at # 14 in its Top Mega Drive Games of All Time . Fans of the original ToeJam & Earl however were disappointed and confused by the game 's departure from the original concept to a more generic platforming format , with GameSpot and Shacknews later asserting that the game disappointed upon its initial release . 
 ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron and ToeJam & Earl comprised one of the Mega Drive 's " key exclusive franchises " . However , Sega 's subsequent video game console , the Saturn , performed poorly in the North American market and thus the franchise was neglected . A ToeJam & Earl game for the Sega Dreamcast was canceled , but a third instalment , ToeJam & Earl III : Mission to Earth , was eventually released for Microsoft 's Xbox in 2002 . The game returned to the concepts of the original game , but generated mixed reviews and poor sales . 
 Since its release , ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron " has developed a negative reputation as a selling @-@ out of a daring design " . With hindsight , Johnson and Voorsanger have stated they regret moving from the prototype sequel to a side @-@ scrolling platform game , though Johnson maintains " ToeJam & Earl 2 was a very original side @-@ scrolling game " . Johnson has further asserted that Toyoda Shinobu , who had been Sega 's Vice President of Development " admitted that it was probably a mistake on Sega 's part to jump to a side @-@ scroller " . A survey by IGN found that a majority of the franchise 's fans favored the original ToeJam & Earl as the best game in the series ; however a significant minority of respondents preferred ToeJam & Earl in Panic on Funkotron at 28 % . Research by the game 's developers said that a majority of fans preferred ToeJam & Earl , though the developers also claimed that " Panic on Funkotron was loved and admired by many " . 
 The game was re @-@ released on the Wii 's Virtual Console on June 1 , 2007 in Europe and June 4 , 2007 in North America . IGN felt the original game was superior , but praised the two @-@ player cooperative mode , fluid animations and the " fair number of extras that add a lot of depth " . GameSpot however called the game " mediocre " , " forgettable " and " not much fun " , though it noted the detailed " unique look " and parallax scrolling . Eurogamer , which gave ToeJam and Earl 's re @-@ release a negative review , praised the departure from the predecessor 's concept , saying " it gets some kudos at least for not following the ' more of the same ' game sequel mentality . " The reviewer praised the " forward thinking " environment interaction , but ultimately decided to give the game a middling score , saying " for all its bold ideas , the basic platforming mechanic is pretty shonky " . 
 The game was released alongside its predecessor as part of Sega 's Heritage Collection on Xbox Live Arcade on November 7 , 2012 and individually for PlayStation Network on November 6 , 2012 in North America and November 7 , 2012 in Europe . 
 = Władysław Sikorski = 
 Władysław Eugeniusz Sikorski ( Polish pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> ] ; May 20 , 1881 – July 4 , 1943 ) was a Polish military and political leader . 
 Prior to the First World War , Sikorski established and participated in several underground organizations that promoted the cause of the independence of Poland from the Russian Empire . He fought with distinction in the Polish Legions during the First World War , and later in the newly created Polish Army during the Polish – Soviet War of 1919 to 1921 . In that war he played a prominent role in the decisive Battle of Warsaw ( 1920 ) . In the early years of the Second Polish Republic , Sikorski held government posts , including serving as Prime Minister ( 1922 to 1923 ) and as Minister of Military Affairs ( 1923 to 1924 ) . Following Józef Piłsudski 's May Coup of 1926 and the installation of the Sanacja government , he fell out of favor with the new régime . 
 During the Second World War , Sikorski became Prime Minister of the Polish Government in Exile , Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief of the Polish Armed Forces , and a vigorous advocate of the Polish cause in the diplomatic sphere . He supported the reestablishment of diplomatic relations between Poland and the Soviet Union , which had been severed after the Soviet pact with Germany and the 1939 invasion of Poland — however , Soviet leader Joseph Stalin broke off Soviet @-@ Polish diplomatic relations in April 1943 following Sikorski 's request that the International Red Cross investigate the Katyń Forest massacre . In July 1943 , a plane carrying Sikorski plunged into the sea immediately after takeoff from Gibraltar , killing all on board except the pilot . The exact circumstances of Sikorski 's death have been disputed and have given rise to a number of conspiracy theories surrounding the crash and his death . Sikorski had been the most prestigious leader of the Polish exiles , and his death was a severe setback for the Polish cause . 
 = = Early life and First World War = = 
 Sikorski was born in <unk> Narodowy , Galicia , at the time part of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Empire . He was the third child in his family ; his father was Tomasz Sikorski , a school teacher ; his mother was Emilia <unk> . His grandfather , Tomasz <unk> Sikorski , had fought and been wounded at the Battle of <unk> <unk> in the November Uprising , during which he received the Virtuti Militari medal . 
 Sikorski attended the <unk> in Rzeszów ( now Konarski 's High School in Rzeszów ) from 1893 to 1897 , then transferred for a year to a Rzeszów teachers ' college . In 1899 he attended the Lwów Franciszek Józef Gymnasium , and in 1902 he passed his final high school exam there . Starting that year , young Sikorski studied engineering at the Lwów Polytechnic , specializing in road and bridge construction , and graduated in 1908 with a diploma in hydraulic engineering . In 1906 Sikorski volunteered for a year 's service in the Austro @-@ Hungarian army and attended the Austrian Military School , obtaining an officer 's diploma and becoming an army reserve second lieutenant ( podporucznik <unk> ) . In 1909 he married Helena <unk> , whom he met while at the high school in Lwów . In 1912 they had a daughter , Zofia . After graduation he worked for the Galician administration 's hydraulic engineering department , working on the regulation of the Vistula river , and later was involved in private enterprises related to construction , real estate and petroleum trade . 
 During his studies at the Polytechnic , Sikorski became involved in the People 's School Association ( Towarzystwo <unk> <unk> ) , an organization dedicated to spreading literacy among the rural populace . Around 1904 – 1905 he was briefly involved with the endecja Association of the Polish Youth " Zet " , and then drifted towards paramilitary socialist organizations related to the Polish Socialist Party , which was intent on securing Polish independence . He made contact with the socialist movement around 1905 – 1906 through the Union for the Resurrection of the Polish Nation ( Związek <unk> Narodu Polskiego ) . In 1908 , in Lwów , Sikorski — together with Józef Piłsudski , Marian <unk> , Walery Sławek , Kazimierz Sosnkowski , Witold <unk> @-@ <unk> and Henryk <unk> — organized the secret Union for Active Struggle ( Związek Walki <unk> ) , with the aim of bringing about an uprising against the Russian Empire , one of Poland 's three partitioners . In 1910 , likewise in Lwów , Sikorski helped to organize a Riflemen 's Association ( the Związek Strzelecki ) , became the president of its Lwów chapter , and became responsible for the military arm within the Commission of Confederated Independence Parties ( Komisja <unk> Stronnictwo <unk> , <unk> ) . Having a military education , he lectured other activists on military tactics . 
 Upon the outbreak of the First World War in July 1914 , Sikorski was mobilized , but through <unk> influence he was allowed to participate in the organizing of the Polish military units , rather than being delegated to other duties by the Austro @-@ Hungarian military command . In the first few weeks of the war he became the chief of the Military Department in the Supreme National Committee ( <unk> Komitet Narodowy , <unk> ) and remained in this post until 1916 . He was a commissioner in charge of the recruitment to the Polish Legions in Kraków , choosing this role over the opportunity to serve in the Legions as a frontline commander . On 30 September 1914 he was promoted to <unk> ( lieutenant colonel ) , and soon after that he became the commander of a Legions officer school ( <unk> <unk> ) . The Legions - the army created by Józef Piłsudski to liberate Poland from Russian and , ultimately , Austro @-@ Hungarian and German rule - initially fought in alliance with Austria @-@ Hungary against Russia . From August 1915 there was growing tension between Sikorski , who advocated cooperation with Austria @-@ Hungary , and Piłsudski , who felt that Austria @-@ Hungary and Germany had betrayed the trust of the Polish people . In 1916 Piłsudski actively campaigned to have the Military Department of <unk> disbanded . In July that year , Sikorski was promoted to pułkownik ( colonel ) . Following the Act of 5th November ( 1916 ) , Sikorski became involved with the Legions ' alternatives , the Polish Auxiliary Corps and Polnische Wehrmacht . In June 1917 Piłsudski refused Austro @-@ Hungarian orders to swear loyalty to the Habsburg Emperor ( the " oath crisis " ) and was interned at the fortress of Magdeburg , while Sikorski abandoned Polnische Wehrmacht and returned to the Austro @-@ Hungarian Army . In 1918 , however , following the February Treaty of Brest @-@ Litovsk and the battle of <unk> , Sikorski chose belatedly to side with Piłsudski , announcing solidarity with his actions , protesting against planned separation of Chełm Land from the planned Polish state , and thus soon joined Piłsudski in internment ( he would be held in <unk> ( <unk> ) ) . Nonetheless , this was not enough to smooth the differences between him and Piłsudski , and these two major Polish leaders would drift farther apart in the continuing years .

 In 1918 the Russian , Austro @-@ Hungarian and German empires collapsed , and Poland once again became independent , but the borders of the Second Polish Republic were not fully determined and unstable . In the east they would be formed in the escalating conflicts among Polish , Ukrainian , Lithuanian and Soviet forces in what culminated in the Polish – Soviet War ( 1919 – 1921 ) . Winston Churchill commented : " The war of giants has ended , the wars of the pygmies began . " Bolshevik leaders saw Poland as a bridge that the communist revolution will have to force to bring communism to the West , and Poland 's very existence would soon be at stake . 
 = = = Polish – Soviet war = = = 
 After his release from internment , from 1 May 1918 Sikorski worked for the Regency Council , organizing the new Polish Army . He was soon at the frontlines again , this time in the Polish – Ukrainian War , where troops under his command secured and defended Przemyśl in October – November 1918 . 
 Polish independence came in November 1918 with the formation of the Second Republic of Poland . In the course of the Polish – Ukrainian War , and in the opening phase of the Polish – Soviet War , Sikorski , now a high @-@ ranking officer of the Polish Army was involved in further operations in the Galicia region . In January 1919 he commanded troops defending Gródek <unk> ; in March that year he commanded an infantry division , advancing to <unk> and <unk> . From 1 August 1918 Sikorski commanded the Polesie Group , and the Polish 9th Infantry Division . In order to curtail excesses of the forces under his command , he oversaw trials of 36 officers . His forces took Mozyr and <unk> in March 1920 , and he would command the Polesie Group during Poland 's Kiev offensive in April 1920 , advancing to Dniepr river and Chernobyl region . On April 1 that year he was promoted to brigade general . 
 As the Polish – Soviet War grew in intensity , in late April 1920 the Red Army of Russia 's new Soviet regime pushed back Polish forces and invaded Poland . Subsequently Sikorski successfully defended Mozyr and <unk> until 29 June , but later failed to hold the Brest fortress , although he defended it long enough to allow the Polish forces in the region to retreat in an orderly manner . On 6 August he was named the commander of the newly formed Polish 5th Army , which was tasked with holding the front to the north of Modlin , between Narew and Wkra rivers . He distinguished himself commanding the 5th Army on the Lower Vistula front during the Battle of Warsaw . At that time Soviet forces , expecting an easy final victory , were surprised and crippled by the Polish counter @-@ attack . During that battle ( sometimes referred to as " the Miracle at the Vistula " ) Sikorski stopped the Bolshevik advance north of Warsaw and gave Piłsudski , the Polish commander @-@ in @-@ chief , the time he needed for his counter @-@ offensive ; beginning with the 15 August his forces successfully engaged the Soviet 5th and 15th Armies . After the Battle of Warsaw , from 30 August , Sikorski commanded the 3rd Army . His forces took Pińsk , and fought during the latter stages of the Battle of Lwów and the Battle of Zamość , and then after Battle of Niemen advanced with his forces toward Latvia and deep into Belarus . The Poles defeated the Soviets , and the Polish – Soviet Treaty of Riga ( March 1921 ) gave Poland substantial areas of Belarus and Ukraine 's ( Kresy ) . Sikorski 's fame was enhanced as he became known to the Polish public as one of the heroes of the Polish – Soviet War . He also kept publishing military science articles during the war itself . For his valorous achievements Sikorski was promoted to divisional general on 28 February 1921 , and was awarded Poland 's highest military decoration , the order of Virtuti Militari , on 15 March that year .

 Despite their differences , Piłsudski praised Sikorski in his reports , recommending him for Chief of the General Staff and Minister of War positions ; only generals Kazimierz Sosnkowski and Edward Rydz @-@ Śmigły received better evaluations from him . Sikorski was popular among many soldiers , and in politics , particularly appealing to Polish conservatives and liberals . On 1 April 1921 Sikorski replaced general Tadeusz Jordan @-@ Rozwadowski as the chief of the Polish General Staff . Between 1922 and 1925 he held a number of high government offices . Based on his analysis , the Polish Council of Ministers adopted new foreign policy that would remain roughly unchanged until the late 1930s ( preserving the status quo in Europe , and treating Germany and Russia as equal sources of potential threat ) . On 12 December 1922 he issued a general order , stressing the need for the military to stay out of politics . After the assassination of President of Poland Gabriel Narutowicz on 16 December 1922 , the Marshal of the Sejm ( Sejm being the Polish parliament ) , Maciej Rataj , appointed Sikorski prime minister . From December 18 , 1922 , to May 26 , 1923 , Sikorski served as Prime Minister and also as Minister of Internal Affairs , and was even considered as possible President . During his brief tenure as prime minister , he became popular with the Polish public and carried out essential reforms in addition to guiding the country 's foreign policy in a direction that gained the approval and cooperation of the League of Nations and tightened Polish @-@ French cooperation . He obtained recognition of Poland 's eastern frontiers from the UK , France and the United States during the Conference of Ambassadors on 15 March 1923 He aided Treasury Minister Władysław Grabski 's reforms aiming at curtailing inflation and reforming the currency , and supported ethnic minorities . His government nonetheless lost support in the Sejm and resigned on 26 May 1923 . 
 From 30 September 1923 to 1924 he held the post of Chief Inspector of Infantry ( <unk> <unk> <unk> ) . From 17 February 1924 to 1925 , under Prime Minister Grabski , he was Minister of Military Affairs and guided the modernization of the Polish military ; he also created the <unk> <unk> <unk> . He worked actively to promote the cause of the Polish @-@ French military alliance . His proposal to increase the powers of the Minister of Military Affairs while reducing those of the Chief Inspector of the Armed Forces met with sharp disapproval from Piłsudski , who at that time was gathering many opponents of the current government . From 1925 to 1928 Sikorski commanded Military Corps District ( <unk> <unk> ) VI in Lwów . 
 A democrat and supporter of the Sejm , Sikorski declared his opposition to Józef Piłsudski 's May coup d 'état in 1926 ; however he remained in Lwów , refused to dispatch his forces , and played no significant role in the short struggle surrounding the coup . In 1928 he was relieved by Piłsudski of his command , and while he remained on active service , he received no other posting . That year also saw the publication of his book on the Polish – Soviet War , Nad Wisłą i <unk> . Studium do polsko – <unk> wojny 1920 roku ( At the Vistula and the Wkra Rivers : a Contribution to the Study of the Polish – Soviet War of 1920 ) . He would spend the following years studying military theory , publishing works on military theory , history and foreign policy . His most famous work was his 1934 book <unk> wojna – <unk> <unk> i <unk> oraz <unk> z <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ( lit . War in the Future : Its Capacities and Character and Associated Questions of National Defense , published in English in as Modern warfare . Its character , its problems in 1943 ) , in which he predicted the return of the maneuver warfare . He wrote several other books and many articles , foreseeing , among other things , the rapid militarization of Germany . 
 In due course , soon after he was relieved of his command , and as a semi @-@ dictatorial Sanacja regime was established , Sikorski joined the anti @-@ Piłsudski opposition . Sikorski largely withdrew from politics , spending much of his time in Paris , France , and working with the French Ecole Superieure de Guerre ( war college ) . Even after the death of Piłsudski in 1935 , he was still marginalized , politically and militarily , by Piłsudski 's successors . In February next year , together with several prominent Polish politicians ( Wincenty Witos , Ignacy Paderewski , and General Józef Haller ) he joined the Front <unk> , an anti @-@ Sanacja political grouping . 
 = = Prime Minister in exile = = 
 In the days before Poland was invaded by Germany in September 1939 , and during the invasion itself , Sikorski 's request for a military command continued to be denied by the Polish Commander in Chief , Marshal Edward Rydz @-@ Śmigły . Sikorski escaped through Romania to Paris , where on 28 September he joined Władysław Raczkiewicz and Stanisław Mikołajczyk in a Polish government @-@ in @-@ exile , taking command of the newly formed Polish Armed Forces in France . Two days later , on September 30 , president Raczkiewicz called him to serve as the first Polish prime minister in exile . On 7 November he became Commander in Chief and General Inspector of the Armed Forces ( <unk> <unk> i <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> ) , following Rydz @-@ Śmigły 's resignation . Sikorski would also hold the position of the Polish Minister of Military Affairs , thus uniting in his person all control over the Polish military in war time . 
 During his years as prime minister in exile , Sikorski personified the hopes and dreams of millions of Poles , as reflected in the saying , " When the sun is higher , Sikorski is nearer " ( Polish : " <unk> <unk> <unk> , to Sikorski <unk> " ) . At the same time , from early on he had to work to reconcile the pro- and anti @-@ Piłsudski 's factions . 
 His government was recognized by the western Allies . Nonetheless Sikorski 's government struggled to get its point of view heard by France and the United Kingdom . The western Allies refused to recognize the Soviet Union as an aggressor , despite the Soviet invasion of Poland on 17 September 1939 . Furthermore , he struggled to secure resources needed to recreate the Polish Army in exile . 
 Poland , even with its territories occupied , still commanded substantial armed forces : the Polish Navy had sailed to Britain , and many thousands of Polish troops had escaped via Romania and Hungary or across the Baltic Sea . Those routes would be used until the end of the war by both interned soldiers and volunteers from Poland , who jocularly called themselves " Sikorski 's tourists " and embarked on their dangerous journeys , braving death or imprisonment in concentration camps if caught by the Germans or their allies . With the steady flow of recruits , the new Polish Army was soon reassembled in France and in French @-@ mandated Syria . In addition to that , Poland had a large resistance movement , and Sikorski 's policies included founding of the Związek Walki Zbrojnej ( Union of Armed Struggle ) , later transformed into Armia Krajowa ( Home Army ) , and creation of the Government Delegation for Poland position , to supervise the Polish Underground State in occupied Poland . 
 In 1940 the Polish Highland Brigade took part in the Battle of Narvik ( Norway ) , and two Polish divisions participated in the defense of France , while a Polish motorized brigade and two infantry divisions were in process of forming . A Polish Independent Carpathian Brigade was created in French @-@ mandated Syria . The Polish Air Force in France had 86 aircraft with one and a half of the squadrons fully operational , and the remaining two and a half in various stages of training . Although many Polish personnel had died in the fighting or had been interned in Switzerland following the fall of France , General Sikorski refused French Marshal Philippe Pétain 's proposal of a Polish capitulation to Germany . On June 19 , 1940 , Sikorski met with British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and promised that Polish forces would fight alongside the British until final victory . Sikorski and his government moved to London and were able to evacuate many Polish troops to Britain . After the signing of a Polish @-@ British Military Agreement on August 5 , 1940 , they proceeded to build up and train the Polish Armed Forces in the West . Experienced Polish pilots took part in the Battle of Britain , where the Polish 303 Fighter Squadron achieved the highest number of kills of any Allied squadron . Sikorski 's Polish forces would form one of the most significant Allied contingents . 
 The Fall of France weakened Sikorski 's position , and his proposal to consider building a new Polish army in the Soviet @-@ occupied territories led to much criticism from within the Polish community in exile . On 19 July Raczkiewicz dismissed him from his position as the Prime Minister , replacing him with August Zaleski , however within days pressure from Sikorski 's sympathizers , including the British government , made Raczkiewicz reconsider his decision , and Sikorski was reinstated as the Prime Minister on 25 July . 
 One of Sikorski 's political goals was the creation of a Central and Eastern European federation , starting with the Polish @-@ Czechoslovakian confederation . He saw such an organization as necessary if smaller states were to stand up to traditional German and Russian imperialism . That concept , although ultimately futile , gained some traction around that time , as Sikorski and Edvard Beneš from the Czechoslovak government @-@ in @-@ exile , signed an agreement declaring the intent to pursue closer cooperation on 10 November that year . On 24 December 1940 Sikorski was promoted to generał broni . In March 1941 he visited the United States ; he would visit USA again in March and December 1942 . 
 Following the German invasion of the Soviet Union ( " Operation Barbarossa " ) in June 1941 , Sikorski opened negotiations with the Soviet ambassador to London , Ivan Maisky , to re @-@ establish diplomatic relations between Poland and the Soviet Union , which had been broken off after the Soviet invasion of Poland in September 1939 . In December that year , Sikorski went to Moscow with a diplomatic mission . The Polish Government reached an agreement with the Soviet Union ( the Sikorski @-@ Maisky Pact of 17 August 1941 ) , confirmed by Joseph Stalin in December of that year . Stalin agreed to invalidate the September 1939 Soviet @-@ German partition of Poland , declare the Russo @-@ German Molotov @-@ Ribbentrop Pact of August 1939 null and void , and release tens of thousands of Polish prisoners @-@ of @-@ war held in Soviet camps . Pursuant to an agreement between the Polish government @-@ in @-@ exile and Stalin , the Soviets granted " amnesty " to many Polish citizens , from whom a new army ( the Polish II Corps ) was formed under General Władysław Anders and later evacuated to the Middle East , where Britain faced a dire shortage of military forces . The whereabouts of thousands more Polish officers , however , would remain unknown for two more years , and this would weigh heavily on both Polish – Soviet relations and on Sikorski 's fate . 
 Initially , Sikorski supported the Polish – Soviet rapprochement , which reignited criticism of his person from some Polish factions . Nonetheless , Sikorski soon realized that the Soviet Union had plans for Polish territories , which would be unacceptable to Polish public . The Soviets began their diplomatic offensive after their first major military victory in the Battle of Moscow , and intensified this policy after the battle of Stalingrad , showing less and less regard for their deals with Poland . In January 1942 British diplomat Stafford Cripps informed General Sikorski that while Stalin planned to extend Polish borders to the west , by giving Poland Germany 's East Prussia , he also wanted to considerably push Poland 's eastern frontier westwards , along the lines of the Versailles concept of the Curzon Line , and acquire Lwów and Wilno , if not both . <unk> 's stance on eastern borders was not inflexible ; he noted in some documents that some concessions might be acceptable , however , giving up both Lwów and Wilno was not . 
 = = Katyn revelation and death = = 
 In 1943 the fragile relations between the Soviet Union and the Polish government @-@ in @-@ exile finally reached their breaking point when , on April 13 , the Germans announced via the Katyn Commission the discovery of the bodies of 20 @,@ 000 Polish officers who had been murdered by the Soviets and buried in Katyn Forest , near Smolensk , Russia . Stalin claimed that the atrocity had been carried out by the Germans , while Nazi propaganda orchestrated by Joseph Goebbels successfully exploited the Katyn massacre to drive a wedge between Poland , the Western Allies and the Soviet Union . The Soviet Union , and subsequently Russia , did not acknowledge responsibility for this and similar massacres of Polish officers until the 1990s . 
 When Sikorski refused to accept the Soviet explanation and requested an investigation by the International Red Cross on April 16 , the Soviets accused the government @-@ in @-@ exile of cooperating with Nazi Germany and broke off diplomatic relations on April 25 . 
 Beginning in late May 1943 , Sikorski began visiting Polish forces stationed in the Middle East . In addition to inspecting the forces and raising morale , Sikorski was also occupied with political matters ; around that time , a conflict was growing between him and General Władysław Anders , as Sikorski was still open to some normalization of Polish – Soviet relations , to which Anders was vehemently opposed . On 4 July 1943 , while Sikorski was returning from an inspection of Polish forces deployed in the Middle East , he was killed , together with his daughter , his Chief of Staff , Tadeusz <unk> , and seven others , when his plane , a Liberator II , serial <unk> , crashed into the sea 16 seconds after takeoff from Gibraltar Airport at 23 : 07 hours . The crash was attributed to cargo on the plane shifting to the back upon takeoff . Only the pilot , Eduard <unk> ( 1911 – 1984 ) , survived the crash . Sikorski was subsequently buried in a brick @-@ lined grave at the Polish War Cemetery in Newark @-@ on @-@ Trent , England on 16 July that year . Winston Churchill delivered a eulogy at his funeral . On 14 September 1993 , his remains were exhumed and transferred via Polish Air Force TU @-@ 154M , and escorted by RAF 56 Sqn Tornado F3 jets , to the royal crypts at Wawel Castle in Kraków , Poland . 
 = = Aftermath and remembrance = = 
 Immediately after the crash , a Polish officer who had witnessed the event from the airstrip began sobbing quietly and repeating : " This is the end of Poland . This is the end of Poland . " ( " To Polska <unk> ! " ) General Sikorski 's death marked a turning point for Polish influence amongst the Anglo @-@ American allies . No Pole after him would have much sway with the Allied politicians . Sikorski had been the most prestigious leader of the Polish exiles and his death was a severe setback for the Polish cause . After the Soviets had broken off diplomatic relations with Sikorski 's government in April 1943 , in May and June Stalin had recalled several Soviet ambassadors for " consultations " : Maxim Litvinov from Washington , Fyodor Gusev from Montreal , and Ivan Maisky from London . While Churchill had been publicly supportive of Sikorski 's government , reminding Stalin of his pact with Nazi Germany in 1939 and their joint attack on Poland , in secret consultations with Roosevelt he admitted that some concessions would have to be made by Poland to appease the powerful Soviets . The Polish – Soviet crisis was beginning to threaten cooperation between the western Allies and the Soviet Union at a time when the Poles ' importance to the western Allies , essential in the first years of the war , was beginning to fade with the entry into the conflict of the military and industrial giants , the Soviet Union and the United States . 
 The Allies had no intention of allowing Sikorski 's successor , Stanisław Mikołajczyk , to threaten the alliance with the Soviets . No representative of the Polish government was invited to the Tehran Conference ( 28 November – 1 December 1943 ) or the Yalta Conference ( 4 – 11 February 1945 ) , the two crucial events in which the Western Allies and the Soviet Union discussed the shape of the post @-@ war world and decided on the fate of Poland . Only four months after Sikorski 's death , in November 1943 , at Tehran , Churchill and Roosevelt agreed with Stalin that the whole of Poland east of the Curzon Line would be ceded to the Soviets . In Teheran , neither Churchill nor Roosevelt objected to Stalin 's suggestion that the Polish government in exile in London was not representing Polish interests ; as historian Anita <unk> noted , " this spelled the end of that government 's tenuous influence and raison d 'être . " After the Teheran Conference , Stalin decided to create his own puppet government for Poland , and a Committee of National Liberation ( PKWN ) was proclaimed in the summer of 1944 . The Committee was recognized by the Soviet Government as the only legitimate authority in Poland , while Mikołajczyk 's Government in London , was termed by the Soviets an " illegal and self @-@ styled authority . " Mikołajczyk would serve in the Prime Minister 's role until 24 November 1944 , when , realizing the increasing powerlessness of the government in exile , he resigned and was succeeded by Tomasz Arciszewski , " whose obscurity " , in the words of historian Mieczysław B. <unk> , " signaled the arrival of the government in exile at total inconsequentiality . " Stalin soon began a campaign for recognition by the Western Allies of a Soviet @-@ backed Polish government led by Wanda Wasilewska , a dedicated communist with a seat in the Supreme Soviet , with General Zygmunt Berling , commander of the 1st Polish Army in Russia , as commander @-@ in @-@ chief of all Polish armed forces . By the time of the Potsdam conference in 1945 , Poland has been relegated to the Soviet sphere of influence ; an abandonment of the Polish government in exile that has led to the rise of the Western betrayal concept . 
 A number of poems dedicated to Sikorski have been written by Polish authors during the war . In its aftermath , in the People 's Republic of Poland , Sikorski 's historic role , like that of all the adherents of the London government , would be minimized and distorted by propaganda , and those loyal to the government @-@ in @-@ exile would be liable to imprisonment and even execution . In time , restrictions on discussing Sikorski began to ease ; on a centennial anniversary of his birth in 1981 , commemorative events were held on the Rzeszów Voivodeship , including an academic conference , and revealing of plaques in Nisko and <unk> . Ryszard Zieliński published a novel on him , <unk> w <unk> ( 1971 ) , and in 1983 a movie , <unk> w <unk> by Bohdan <unk> , was made . The Polish government @-@ in @-@ exile , of which Sikorski was the first Prime Minister , would continue in existence until the end of communist rule in Poland in 1990 , when Lech Wałęsa became the first post @-@ communist President of Poland . On 17 September 1993 a statue of Sikorski , sculpted by <unk> <unk> , was revealed in Rzeszów . In 1995 , Sikorski became the patron of the newly formed Polish 9th Mechanized Brigade . In 2003 , the Polish parliament ( Sejm ) declared the year ( 60th anniversary of Sikorski 's death ) to be the " Year of General Sikorski " . A number of streets and schools in Poland bear Sikorski 's name . 
 Memory of General Sikorski was also preserved both in Poland and abroad , by organizations like the Sikorski Institute in London . In the UK , Sikorski received honoris causa degrees from the University of Liverpool and University of St Andrews . In 1981 , a commemorative plaque was revealed at Hotel Rubens in London , where during the war Polish Military Headquarters , including Sikorski 's office , were located . He is commemorated in London 's Portland Place , near the Embassy of Poland , with a larger than life statue , unveiled in 2000 . A propeller from the plane in which he died is the centrepiece of a new memorial to Sikorski at Europa Point , Gibraltar . 
 = = Controversy surrounding his death = = 
 A British Court of Inquiry convened on July 7 that year investigated the crash of Sikorski 's Liberator II serial AL 523 , but was unable to determine the cause , finding only that it was an accident and " due to jamming of elevator controls " , noting that " it has not been possible to determine how the jamming occurred but it has been established that there was no sabotage . " . The Polish government refused to endorse this report , due to the contradiction about the cause not being determined but sabotage being ruled out . 
 The political context of the event , coupled with a variety of curious circumstances , immediately gave rise to numerous speculation that Sikorski 's death had been no accident , and may have been the direct result of a Soviet , British , or even Polish conspiracy . Some modern sources still note that the accident is not fully explained ; for example Jerzy Jan <unk> in his Historical Dictionary of Poland ( 1996 ) , entry on the " Gibraltar , Catastrophe of " , notes that " there are several theories explaining the event , but the mystery was never fully solved . " However , as Roman Wapiński noted in his biographical entry on Sikorski in the Polish Biographical Dictionary in 1997 , no conclusive evidence of any wrongdoing has been found , and Sikorski 's official cause of death is listed as an accident . 
 In 2008 Sikorski was exhumed and his remains were examined by Polish scientists , who in 2009 concluded that he died due to injuries consistent with an air crash , and that there was no evidence that Sikorski was murdered , ruling out theories that he was shot or strangled before the incident ; however they did not rule out the possibility of sabotage , which is still being investigated by the Polish Institute of National Remembrance . As of 2012 , the investigation continues .

 = Little Athletics = 
 Little Athletics is an Australian activity program that involves modified athletics events for children aged 5 to 15 ( or 16 in ACT , NSW , Qld and SA ) . More than 100 @,@ 000 young Australians competed in the sport in the 2013 / 14 season . 
 The competitions were founded by Trevor Billingham , a young Australian athletics enthusiast from Geelong , Victoria , in 1964 . By 1967 , there were more than 35 Little Athletics clubs in Victoria , and the decision was made to start the Victorian Little Athletics Association ( VLAA ) . 
 Soon after the formation of the VLAA , other states expressed interest in Little Athletics . In February 1968 , a year after the formation of the VLAA , Western Australia held its first Little Athletics meet at Perry Lakes Stadium . In 1972 , the states of Victoria , New South Wales , Northern Territory and Western Australia became the founding members of The Australian Little Athletics Union ( ALAU ) , which was formed in Perth . By 1974 , Tasmania , Australian Capital Territory , South Australia and Queensland had all joined the ALAU .

 Available Little Athletics events vary between age groups and from state to state . The following represents the range of events available .

 Under the independent governing body Little Athletics Australia ( LAA ) , each mainland state and territory has its own association , responsible for running Little Athletics in that state . Each state body controls the relevant centres and events in their state or territory . Clubs are the lowest level of the Little Athletics structure . Clubs are sections of centres , often have separate training sections and inform athletes of upcoming events . 
 = = History = = 
 In October 1963 , three young boys turned up at a senior athletics meet in Geelong , Victoria . They approached official Trevor Billingham , but Billingham turned them away citing their youth as a reason for them not to be allowed to compete . A few months later , Billingham held a coaching camp for secondary school students . His camp had a lot of primary school students in attendance . 
 Billingham decided to set up a Saturday competition for younger children . The first competition was on 3 October 1964 , in Geelong . Billingham had advertised the event in the Geelong Advertiser by saying : 
 " Also starting this Saturday , will be the special morning meeting for boys and girls . These will commence at 10 : 30 a.m. each Saturday and will be open to any school age competitor . It is intended that boys and girls not old enough to compete in the afternoon will take part in these special meetings . Anyone interested in the sport may attend , including parents , while the one @-@ hour of athletics is conducted . All of the standard athletic events will be conducted and boys and girls will be graded in each event . " 
 After the event , he wrote a one @-@ page article titled " Junior Athletics in Wet Conditions " , which appeared in the Geelong Advertiser on 5 October 1964 . He wrote that more than 80 boys and girls attended . He also wrote that there was a considerable need for such junior athletic competitions at the time , that the event was a success , and more events of the same type were to be held in the future . 
 By 1965 , Billingham had still not convinced the Geelong branch of the Victorian Amateur Athletics Association ( VAAA ) . In January 1965 , Billingham acquired lights for the Geelong senior athletics oval , Landy Field , which was also where the Little Athletics competition were . The lights were originally erected at <unk> Park for the 1956 Olympics ; Billingham asked the Geelong Football Club if he could use the lights , and they allowed him . Billingham invited Ron Clarke to the now lighted Landy Field to break the 20 @,@ 000 meters and one hour run world records , and Clarke accepted . In January 1965 , Billingham also thought up the name " Little Athletics " ; previously the events had been called " Junior Athletics " . He took his two proposals to the VAAA , and both were accepted . 
 On 9 October 1965 , the 1965 / 66 Geelong Little Athletics season started . 14 meets were held , with a fee of three shillings for the season . 
 Billingham was the sole <unk> for the Ron Clarke visit . When Clarke came , he broke both world records and brought fame to the Geelong Centre of the VAAA at Landy Field . 
 Despite his success with Clarke , Billingham still could not get support for Little Athletics from VAAA ; instead , they suggested he drop the junior competition and focus on the rapidly expanding senior one . One of the delegates , Jack Frewin , encouraged him to push through with his idea , so he published a notice in the Geelong Advertiser announcing that he needed to start a formation of Little Athletics clubs . There was a meeting of interested parents , and Billingham told them that he thought an organisation should be set up based on his experience from the seniors competitions but he need some parents to help him . On 27 November 1965 , six clubs were formed . They were run by parents with Billingham as an overall manager . By the end of the 1965 / 66 season , more than 200 boys and girls were competing regularly across nine clubs , and more than 500 had tried out at least once . The first Geelong championships were held in March 1966 over the long weekend . 
 There was another meeting in March 1966 . John McGlynn , an executive from the Ford Motor Company , suggested that there was a need to encourage other clubs from areas outside Geelong to start up . By September 1966 , there were clubs in Geelong , Belmont , Newtown , Lara , Corio YMCA and St Thomas . They were all based around local high schools . 
 In May 1967 , the Victorian Little Athletics Association ( VLAA ) was formed . By 1969 , there were 39 clubs in the VLAA . The first Western Australian meet was in February 1968 at Perry Lakes Stadium . In March 1968 , a Western Australian association was formed . Competitions in New South Wales started in October 1968 . In 1972 , the Australian Little Athletics Union ( ALAU ) was formed in Perth . Victoria , New South Wales , Northern Territory and Western Australia were the founding members . Tasmania , South Australia , Australian Capital Territory and Queensland joined shortly afterwards .

Boucaud was pursued by Premier League club Arsenal although he stayed with Reading as they gave him a three @-@ year contract . He was loaned out to Second Division side Peterborough United until the end of the 2002 – 03 season on 27 March 2003 and he made his debut two days later as an 85th minute substitute in a 5 – 1 victory at Mansfield Town . He finished the season with six appearances for Peterborough . 
 Reading agreed to allow Boucaud to rejoin Peterborough on loan in June 2003 , and Reading manager Alan Pardew said " he 's done enough to convince me that I shouldn 't keep him there for too long " . His return to Peterborough was completed on an initial one @-@ month loan on 8 August 2003 . His first appearance after returning was in a 4 – 3 defeat to Hartlepool United the following day , and in September 2003 Peterborough manager Barry Fry said he wanted to extend Boucaud 's stay at the club . Having made nine appearances and scored one goal for Peterborough in two months , he returned to Reading on 7 October 2003 .

 = Yesterday 's Enterprise = 
 " Yesterday 's Enterprise " is the 63rd episode of the television series Star Trek : The Next Generation . It was the 15th episode of the third season . The episode first aired in syndication the week of February 19 , 1990 . In the plot , the crew of the USS Enterprise @-@ D must decide whether to send the time @-@ travelling Enterprise @-@ C back through a temporal rift to its certain destruction in order to prevent their own disastrous timeline from ever occurring . 
 The plot for " Yesterday 's Enterprise " came from the uniting of two story ideas ; one which featured the crew of the time @-@ travelling Enterprise @-@ C , and another episode which featured the return of Denise Crosby , whose character had been killed in the show 's first season . Trent Christopher Ganino and Eric A. Stillwell rewrote the story to more prominently feature the character of Guinan , and the script was completed by a team of five writers . 
 Filming of the episode lasted a week ; some planned elements , including death scenes for many of the characters , were either too time @-@ intensive or costly to film . In syndication , " Yesterday 's Enterprise " outperformed most of the third season 's episodes with a 13 @.@ 1 ranking , the third @-@ highest number for the series at the time . The episode is cited as a favorite by members of the cast and by reviewers . 
 In December 2015 , writer / director Quentin Tarantino cited this episode as one he feels could be expanded into a feature film ( on Podcast " The Nerdist " hosted by Chris Hardwick on December 18 , 2015 ) . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The Enterprise @-@ D encounters a rift in space @-@ time while on a routine mission . As they monitor the anomaly , the heavily damaged USS Enterprise @-@ C , a ship believed destroyed more than two decades earlier , emerges . Instantly , the Enterprise @-@ D undergoes a sudden and radical change : it is now a warship and the Federation is at war with the Klingons . Neither Worf nor Counselor Troi are seen or referred to , and Tasha Yar runs the tactical station . None of the crew notice the change , but Guinan senses that reality has changed , and has a meeting with Captain Picard . She says , for example , that there are supposed to be children on the ship , which of course is completely impractical on a warship . She suggests that the Enterprise @-@ C does not belong in their time and should return to the past . Picard , who knows that this would be a suicide mission , refuses to give such an order on Guinan 's intuition alone . 
 Captain Rachel Garrett of the Enterprise @-@ C and her crew learn they have travelled into the future . Garrett explains that they were responding to a distress call from the Klingon outpost on Narendra III , and were attacked by Romulan warbirds . While the crew works to repair the Enterprise @-@ C and tend to the crew 's injuries , Picard and his command staff discuss whether or not the ship should return to the past . Riker argues that their deaths would be meaningless , but Data suggests that it would be considered an honorable act by the Klingons . Picard discusses the situation with Garrett , who tells him that her crew will serve the Federation in the present . Picard quietly reveals to her that the Federation is on the verge of defeat and the presence of one ship will make no difference , but if the Enterprise @-@ C were to return to the past they might prevent the war from ever starting . Garrett agrees and announces to her crew that they will return through the anomaly , but at that moment , the two ships are ambushed by a Klingon Bird of Prey . Garrett is killed , and her helmsman , Richard Castillo , takes command . 
 During the repair efforts , Yar has become close to Castillo , but is unnerved by tense interactions with Guinan . Guinan reveals to Yar that she knows that Yar dies a meaningless death in the alternate timeline , and the two never should have met . Yar requests a transfer to the Enterprise @-@ C based on Guinan 's advice , to which Picard agrees . 
 As the Enterprise @-@ C prepares to return through the anomaly , three Klingon battlecruisers attack . With the anomaly becoming unstable , Picard orders the Enterprise @-@ D to cover the Enterprise @-@ C 's withdrawal . The Enterprise @-@ D suffers major crew losses under the Klingon barrage , including the death of Commander Riker , forcing Picard to man tactical himself . With the Enterprise @-@ D on the brink of destruction , the Enterprise @-@ C traverses the anomaly . 
 In the restored timeline , Guinan , still subtly aware of these events , asks La Forge to tell her more about Yar .

 At the beginning of Star Trek : The Next Generation 's third season , Michael Piller became the series ' head writer . Among the changes he implemented was to open the submission process for stories to non @-@ professional writers , or those not represented by agents ; though the studio resisted the effort , The Next Generation became the first show in Hollywood to allow such writers to submit their scripts . As soon as word got out , the studio was swamped with scripts — more than 5 @,@ 000 would arrive in a single year . 
 Among the scripts submitted by freelance or aspiring writers was one by Trent Christopher Ganino . Ganino completed a third draft of his speculative script in April 1989 and submitted it to the office of pre @-@ production associate Eric A. Stillwell . Ganino 's script , titled " Yesterday 's Enterprise " , ran 106 pages , far longer than the usual 65 @-@ page submission guideline , but a special allowance was made since the script was double @-@ spaced . The story involved the Enterprise @-@ D 's response to a crisis in the <unk> sector and the discovery of the Enterprise @-@ C , which had been destroyed 18 years before . The crew of the Enterprise @-@ C is in awe of the newer ship 's technology , but Picard is confronted with revealing to their guests their ultimate fate . An Enterprise @-@ C ensign accidentally discovers the fate of his vessel and panics ; Worf and Riker must capture him after he attempts to escape . When <unk> warships attack , Picard defends the Enterprise @-@ C using the same maneuver that caused the vessel 's destruction in the past . The ensign is hypnotized and returned to his ship , which returns to the past to its certain destruction . 
 Due to the backlog of scripts , processing all the drafts could take anywhere from weeks to a year . Ganino 's script was " logged " on May 2 and first read later that month by Richard Manning , a co @-@ producer on the writing staff . Manning commented that the draft was " not horrible , not particularly original , but good in spots , lousy in others " ; while not the review Ganino had hoped for , it was enough to keep the script in circulation . 
 Meanwhile , Ganino and Stillwell had struck up a friendship and began to develop ideas for other episodes . Gene Roddenberry had distributed a memo that suggested that though it would be unlikely to feature Leonard Nimoy as Spock on the series due to financial considerations , he suggested a reasonable alternative would be to feature Mark Lenard , who played Spock 's father , Sarek . Stillwell also met Denise Crosby , who had played Tasha Yar in the show 's first season , at a 1989 fan convention in San Jose . Over dinner , Crosby admitted she missed being part of the show and suggested that Stillwell could write a script to bring back her character , who had been killed off in the episode " Skin of Evil " . Ganino and Stillwell began to work on script ideas that would involve both Yar and Sarek . 
 In the meantime , executive story editor Melinda Snodgrass read Ganino 's spec script for " Yesterday 's Enterprise " in June and attached a post @-@ it note that declared that the story was an " interesting idea " . A " coverage " of the script , which outlined the plot and provided creative feedback , was written in August . The coverage 's analysis called the script a " good effort by an unrepresented writer " , and considered the script 's weak characterization and plot issues correctable . The main issue was whether the producers wanted to do a show with time travel . 
 Ganino and Stillwell were particular fans of two episodes from the original Star Trek series , " Mirror , Mirror " and " The City on the Edge of Forever " , and wanted to combine elements from them for a Next Generation episode . The foundation of their episode involved a team of Vulcans investigating the Guardian of Forever . In the past , the founder of modern Vulcan logic , Surak , is killed , causing massive changes to the timeline . The Romulans and Vulcans joined forces to attack the Federation ; Worf is no longer a crewmember on the Enterprise and Tasha Yar remains alive . Sarek and the Vulcans on the surface are the only people not affected by the timeline change , and in the end Sarek returns to the past to take Surak 's place and restore the timeline . Satisfied with the story , the writers decided to pitch the idea to Piller . 
 Piller read " Yesterday 's Enterprise " and suggested to producer Rick Berman that the story , not the script , be bought from Ganino . In a meeting , Piller told Ganino that he wanted to make changes to the story , which included the addition of Tasha Yar . Fearing that what they considered a better story was to be lost if the changes to " Yesterday 's Enterprise " were undertaken , Stillwell talked to Piller and pitched their Guardian of Forever story . While intrigued by elements , Piller felt the use of the Guardian was a " gimmick " and wanted The Next Generation to stand on its own . Instead , Piller suggested that they merge the two stories , with Stillwell and Ganino to share a writing credit . In meetings with the writers , Piller suggested that the Enterprise crew immediately undergo changes due to the presence of the older Enterprise , and that Guinan be integral to the realization that something was wrong . Ganino and Stillwell were ultimately given two weeks to complete their new story . 
 = = = Writing = = = 
 Ganino and Stillwell managed to complete their new combined story in slightly over a week ; the two writers spent hours each day at Stillwell 's apartment working over every detail . They were under pressure to write a story Piller would find acceptable , as they wanted to have the opportunity to write the teleplay . The story treatment was turned in on October 10 . Piller immediately decided to purchase the story , and distributed the treatment to the writing staff while he discussed changes . Piller felt Data 's romantic feelings for Tasha Yar were over @-@ the @-@ top , and that the alien probe that served as a central part of the story felt like a cheat in terms of resolving Picard 's dilemma . The writer wanted Ganino and Stillwell to beef up Guinan 's role and find another character arc for Tasha Yar . A revised treatment was submitted on October 29 , which incorporated Piller 's changes , but the writers learned that they would not be involved in development of the teleplay ; each was paid the Writers Guild minimum of $ 2400 . 
 Meanwhile , production of the episode was moved up from January 1990 to December 1989 , as this was the only time both Crosby and Whoopi Goldberg would be available for filming . The task of writing and polishing the new treatment in half the time fell upon writer Ronald D. Moore , who submitted his first draft on November 9 . Moore 's script made the alternate universe militaristic , with the Federation at war with the Klingons , and the alien probe was removed . The writing staff sat down in mid @-@ November to " break " the story , and turn the treatment into a rough script outline . Some characters , such as Troi , appeared only briefly at the beginning of the episode in order to offer more screen time to the guest characters of Guinan , Yar , Garrett , and Castillo . The beat sheet for the episode , which detailed characters and scenes , was distributed on November 27 . 
 Because of the lack of time before production needed to start , a team of writers was assigned to the task of writing the teleplay . In addition to the story credit to Ganino and Stillwell , Moore , Ira Steven Behr , Hans Beimler and Richard Manning would work on the teleplay with Piller to provide a final polish — a total of seven writers . Some of the staff were convinced that with so many writers , the script would be a disaster . Because the Writers Guild would not allow more than three staff writers to appear in the credits ( four after a special waiver was granted ) , Piller agreed not to feature his name in the credits . A partial first draft was turned in on November 30 so that preproduction for the episode could commence . The altered timeline provided the chance to show the Enterprise crew in a much more dramatic and human light than would be allowable in a normal episode ; since the original timeline was to be restored , Behr explained , the writers had the freedom to include more action . " Even though it was an alternate universe , [ Moore ] and I got all excited because we realized we were going to kill everyone on screen ! " he said . Michael Okuda and Rick Sternbach submitted technical memos on what kind of anomaly might drag the Enterprise @-@ C through time , and suggested interstellar , super @-@ dense strings as a possibility . The first draft teleplay was completed by December 4 , and a preproduction meeting was held the same day ; the various departments argued over costs and what items could be cut to reduce the budget . The final draft was finished and turned in on December 8 . 
 = = = Design = = = 
 After everyone had read the script , the studio decided to spend a little more on the episode than average ( at that time , Daily Variety estimated an average cost of $ 1 @.@ 2 million . ) This gave the production departments added liberties beyond what had been expected in the script . Among the reasons for the increase in budget was that " Yesterday 's Enterprise " would air during February sweeps , an important time for the studio to attract solid ratings . As The Next Generation was syndicated directly by the studio , the episode 's performance would impact advertising revenue for the future . 
 The script called for the creation of the Enterprise @-@ C. In the first season , illustrator Andrew Probert , who had designed the Enterprise @-@ D , was interested in a display of the design lineage of the ship from James T. Kirk 's Enterprises to The Next Generation 's much larger ship ( realized as a wall relief in the conference lounge behind the command bridge ) . Like most others , Probert assumed that the Enterprise @-@ B was an Excelsior @-@ class vessel and reasoned that the C would share design elements with its Excelsior @-@ class predecessor and its Galaxy @-@ class successor , Picard 's ship . The artist also produced a small color sketch of his version of Enterprise @-@ C , but left at the end of the season ; with his absence , no one knew what the drawing was intended to be . 
 When Rick Sternbach took over Probert 's duties , he believed the sketch was a rejected concept for the Enterprise @-@ D , but the ship 's design stayed with him . When he learned about the ship requirement for " Yesterday 's Enterprise " , he followed a thought process similar to Probert and built off the old sketch . Probert 's version had a highly curved engineering hull reminiscent of a sailing ship , but Sternbach was worried a design with so many compound curves would prove difficult to fabricate in the available time , so he made the hull entirely circular . A set of orthographic views was created and sent to Greg Jein , who fabricated the shooting model ; the model cost more than $ 10 @,@ 000 to produce . 
 The crew took several steps to differentiate the alternate universe from the original one . A " military log " is substituted for a captain 's log , " combat date " rather than stardate , and the absence of a counselor . The expanded budget allowed the bridge to be entirely redressed , something that would normally be infeasible . Steps replaced the bridge 's ramps , and the captain 's chair was elevated and made more throne @-@ like . Longer , more military @-@ looking tables were substituted for the usual decor in the Ten @-@ Forward lounge . While enlisted crew aboard the darker Enterprise wore variations of the Season 1 – 2 uniforms , the senior officers wore slightly modified versions of the uniforms added that season . The Enterprise @-@ C officers wore feature film costumes due to the expense and time @-@ consuming nature of creating more than a half @-@ dozen or so new uniforms for the episode . Costume designer Robert Blackman 's solution to change their appearance was to remove the turtleneck collars underneath the red tunics , as well as the belts , although the rear belt loop remained . 
 = = = Filming and casting = = = 
 Filming began on Monday , December 11 , 1989 and lasted for seven days . The episode was directed by David Carson , who had only helmed one other episode before " Yesterday 's Enterprise " was shot . Carson felt that his relative lack of experience helped because he had no preconceptions about how things should be done . Since much of the episode took place in the darker alternate universe , Carson wanted to emphasize the effect decades of war had on the crew and the bridge . " Picard really looked tired and worn and like a battle @-@ weary commander , and that 's what we wanted the bridge to look <unk> battle weary bridge . I had lots of thoughts about making it as strong as possible using a lot of low lights , a lot of dark blues , making it very much more moody , " he said . In order to heighten the impact of the physical set changes , Carson took a different approach to how he constructed shots . " It was my intention to make it as much like a submarine as possible and to use low @-@ angle lighting ; basically , to do everything the opposite way that the Enterprise was normally shot . " The cameras were equipped with longer lenses than usual in order to reduce the depth of the scenes and provide a grittier feel . The use of low angles forced the lighting to be modified in order to prevent the scene from looking " like a hotel lobby " , in Carson 's words . 
 Two new roles needed to be filled for the production : Garrett and Castillo . The actors selected were both Star Trek fans . Christopher McDonald was picked for Castillo . " What impressed me about [ McDonald ] , " Carson remembers , " was that he wasn 't just your romantic leading man ; he was actually a very impressive actor . " Tricia O 'Neil was cast for similar reasons ; the actress was not the normal Star Trek commander type . Carson was also pleased to work with Crosby and Goldberg . The main cast enjoyed the opportunity to play their characters differently . The result was an unusual degree of friction between characters . This provoked some concern with the producers ; Berman was afraid that the episode was pushing the timeline too far . 
 Ganino and Stillwell visited the set frequently during filming . Members of the main cast approached Stillwell with questions about the nature of the altered universe and if they were still the same character . Goldberg asked Ganino about changing a piece of dialogue on set ; since Ganino was not the author of the teleplay , he deferred to Stillwell , who notified the production office . When Berman found out that Ganino and Stillwell were on set and talking to the actors , he banned them from setting foot on the sets again . Due to time constraints many planned elements were never filmed ; Moore had hoped for an extended battle scene in which Data would be electrocuted , and Wesley blown up in an explosion . Production of the episode wrapped on December 19 .

 = The Rejected = 
 The Rejected ( 1961 ) is a made @-@ for @-@ television documentary film about homosexuality , produced for KQED in San Francisco by John W. Reavis . The Rejected was the first documentary program on homosexuality broadcast on American television . It initially ran on KQED on September 11 , 1961 , and was later syndicated to National Educational Television ( NET ) stations across the country . The Rejected received positive critical reviews upon airing . 
 = = Production = = 
 Reavis , an independent producer who was apparently unconnected to the homophile movement , wrote up his idea for The Rejected in 1960 . Reavis originally titled the documentary The Gay Ones . He explained his goals for the program in his proposal : 
 The object of the program will be to present as objective analysis of the subject as possible , without being overly clinical . The questions will be basic ones : who are the gay ones , how did they become gay , how do they live in a heterosexual society , what treatment is there by medicine or psychotherapy , how are they treated by society , and how would they like to be treated ? 
 Thus , Reavis approached the topic from the standpoint of homosexuality being a social problem akin to alcoholism or prostitution . This echoed how many earlier programs , often produced as episodes of local talk shows , addressed homosexuality with shows bearing such titles as " Homosexuals and the Problems They Present " and " Homosexuality : A Psychological Approach " . The Rejected focused exclusively on gay men , with no representation of lesbians . Reavis expressed his reluctance to include lesbians in his proposal : 
 First , the repugnance — or desire not to think about the problem — is even greater in society than that towards the problem of Gay men . Second , the number of persons involved is much smaller .... Third , the problems are vastly different , as are the solutions . For example , promiscuity is much less , relationships apt to be bilateral , economic and social sanctions are less , and the ability to carry on a relationship of this sort is greatly simplified . 
 Commercial stations turned down the program , as did sponsors . KQED bought the project in early 1961 under the new title . The documentary was shot entirely in the KQED studio except for one segment on location at the Black Cat Bar , a San Francisco gay bar that had been fighting state and police harassment since 1948 . Reavis and co @-@ producer Irving Saraf filmed The Rejected on a budget of less than $ 100 . 
 Reavis and director Richard Christian utilized the talk show format , breaking down the subject matter into a series of smaller topics . Each segment included one or more subject matter experts discussing homosexuality from a different perspective . Within each segment , Reavis presented a stereotype about homosexuality and then challenged the validity of that stereotype through the expert interviews . His goal , as he noted in his original proposal , was to give the viewer " a feeling he is confused and that society as a whole is confused about homosexuality " . Experts interviewed for the program included : 
 Margaret Mead speaking from an anthropological standpoint . Mead spoke of the positive roles that homosexuality had played in the cultures of Ancient Greece and the South Sea Islands and in Inuit and Native American societies . Mead noted that it is society and not the individual that determines how homosexuality and homosexual behaviour are viewed . 
 Psychiatrist Karl Bowman of the Langley Porter Psychiatric Institute , who explained the Kinsey scale of human sexuality and who spoke against a punitive approach to treating homosexual patients . Medical doctor Erwin Braff also addressed medical issues . 
 Episcopal Bishop of San Francisco James Pike and rabbi Alvin Fine addressed religious topics . Each man espoused his belief that sodomy laws should be repealed because in his opinion homosexuality was a mental illness . Pike specifically compared homosexuality to chronic alcoholism , but called for homosexuals to be treated with " love and concern and interest " and for not condemning them as " evil " . 
 The city 's district attorney , Thomas C. Lynch , covered legal issues along with lawyers J. Albert Hutchinson , Al <unk> , and Morris Lowenthal ( who had previously defended the Black Cat Bar during its 15 @-@ year legal battle against police and government harassment ) . 
 Openly gay Mattachine Society president Hal Call , Mattachine executive secretary Donald Lucas and Mattachine treasurer Les Fisher spoke for gay men . The Rejected was unusual for its time in that it included actual gay people as opposed to only presenting ostensibly heterosexual experts . 
 KQED station manager James Day opened the documentary by reading a statement from California 's then @-@ Attorney General Stanley Mosk : 
 With all the revulsion that some people feel toward homosexuality , it cannot be dismissed by simply ignoring its presence . It is a subject that deserves discussion . We might just as well refuse to discuss alcoholism or narcotics addiction as to refuse to discuss this subject . It cannot be swept under the rug . It will not just go away . 
 = = Critical and popular response = = 
 The Rejected was critically and popularly well @-@ received upon its initial airing . Variety described it as handling the topic in a " matter @-@ of @-@ fact down @-@ the @-@ middle manner , covering it quite thoroughly and , for the most part , interestingly " . Terrence O 'Flaherty , critic for the San Francisco Chronicle , concurred , praising KQED for its courage in addressing the subject matter , as did the San Francisco Examiner , which said the program " handled [ the topic ] soberly , calmly and in great depth " . Of the letters KQED received , which numbered in the hundreds , 97 % were positive and many of the writers encouraged the station to make more programs like it . Dorian Book Service out of San Francisco published a transcript of The Rejected , and close to 400 people ordered copies . KQED syndicated The Rejected to NET channels across the country ; it aired on as many of 40 of the 55 NET stations and was repeated on educational stations in 1963 and 1964 . Conservative members of the gay community were pleased with how the Mattachine members presented themselves as ordinary people , an image that differed from the perception held by many outside the community . Some more radical activists , including Frank Kameny and Randy Wicker , found the program wanting for the apologetic tone it took toward homosexuality . 
 In 2002 , the Gay & Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation presented KQED with the first Pioneer Award , in recognition of its production of The Rejected as the beginning of a long history of LGBT @-@ related programming . 
 = = Availability = = 
 KQED , after airing The Rejected , did not archive a hard copy of the documentary , and for many years , the full documentary was considered lost , with only transcripts available . Robert <unk> , an archivist for KQED , and Alex <unk> , an archivist for the J. Paul Leonard Library at San Francisco State University , searched for any remaining hard copy for up to six years . Eventually , the two found that the film was owned by WNET , which funded the film , and a single 2 @-@ inch quad videotape was archived in the Library of Congress . The Library 's Recording Laboratory had already remastered the film onto a digital format and provided the San Francisco Bay Area Television Archive with a copy , for the purpose of making it available online . The 60 @-@ minute film was released by the TV Archive online on May 22 , 2015 . 
 The co @-@ producer of the film , Irving Saraf , also alluded to 30 extra minutes of unaired footage , including content filmed in the Black Cat Bar . This extra footage has not been recovered . Production correspondence written from March to July 1961 between KQED 's Program Manager Jonathan Rice and NET 's Director of TV Programming Donley F. Feddersen refer to scenes featuring the bar and its owner Sol <unk> that had been shot but were probably going to be cut from the final edit . These documents were preserved by the Wisconsin Historical Society . 
 = The Carpet from Bagdad = 
 The Carpet from Bagdad is a 1915 American silent adventure film directed by Colin Campbell and based on Harold MacGrath 's 1911 eponymous novel . In the story , Horace Wadsworth ( played by Guy Oliver ) , one of a gang of criminals also planning a bank robbery in New York , steals the titular prayer rug from its Baghdad mosque . He sells the carpet to antique dealer George Jones ( Wheeler Oakman ) to fund the robbery scheme . But the theft places both men and Fortune Chedsoye ( Kathlyn Williams ) , the innocent daughter of another conspirator , in danger from the carpet 's guardian . 
 Marketing for the film included a media tour of part of the set and an invitation @-@ only screening sponsored by the publisher of MacGrath 's book . The Carpet from Bagdad was released on 3 May 1915 to mostly positive reviews . Many praised the tinted desert scenes and realistic Middle East imagery , although some felt the scenery overshadowed the characters . The film is now mostly lost , although one badly damaged reel was salvaged from the RMS Lusitania in 1982 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Horace Wadsworth , disinherited brother of New York banker Arthur Wadsworth , joins a gang of international criminals . He plots to rob his brother 's bank by constructing a tunnel from the nearby home of antique dealer George Jones , who is currently on a trip to Cairo to purchase antique rugs . Horace follows him there , and , learning of the Sacred Carpet of Bagdad , joins the caravan of its sworn guardian , Mohamed . Meanwhile , Horace 's confederates Major Callahan and Mrs. Chedsoye arrive in Cairo along with Mrs. Chedsoye 's daughter , Fortune , who is unaware of her mother 's illicit activities . 
 When the criminals meet with Jones in Cairo , Jones becomes enamored of Fortune . Horace steals the Sacred Carpet from Mohamed 's mosque and sells it to Jones to fund the robbery plan . Fortune , becoming suspicious of her mother and the surrounding events , steals the prayer rug from Jones and hides it in her mother 's effects . Unable to locate the stolen carpet , Mohamed kidnaps Horace , Jones , and Fortune . Meanwhile , Mrs. Chedsoye and Major Callahan return to New York , where a fourth member of the conspiracy , Wallace , has acquired forged paperwork to gain access to the Jones residence . 
 The captives escape from Mohamed 's planned torture and flee to Damascus . Horace immediately returns to New York to rejoin his compatriots . Fortune and Jones , who have fallen in love , also travel back to New York . Once there , Jones learns of the forgery , and returns home to confront the gang , who still have the Sacred Carpet and who have completed their tunnel into the vaults of Arthur Wadsworth 's bank . Sympathetic to Horace after their shared experiences , Jones offers the robbers a two @-@ hour lead before he notifies the police , but keeps the prayer rug . Meanwhile , Mohamed resigns himself to the loss of the carpet .

 The Carpet from Bagdad is a film adaptation of Harold MacGrath 's 1911 novel of the same name . MacGrath was a well @-@ traveled , successful author of over a dozen novels . Stories with Asian settings were in vogue at the time , and both The Carpet from Bagdad and the Selig Polyscope Company 's previous adaptation of MacGrath 's work , the popular serial The Adventures of Kathlyn , are set in part in the Near East . 
 Director Colin Campbell was concerned with the film 's realism . He had sets constructed to represent the streets of Cairo , Baghdad , and Damascus , and used animals from the Selig Zoo . Scenes set in the Arabian and Sahara Deserts were filmed in the deserts of California . The Arab characters ' clothing was genuine , and the actors portraying those roles were required to remain dressed in @-@ character throughout the several days of desert filming to ensure they would appear more natural in the imported garments . Much of the film , including the desert scenes , was hand tinted . Production costs exceeded $ 35 @,@ 000 , the equivalent of over $ 800 @,@ 000 in present @-@ day terms . 
 William Selig aggressively promoted his studio and its films . One such promotion , a March 1915 media tour of the unfinished Selig Zoo , allowed reporters a visit to The Carpet from Bagdad 's bazaar set . This was the first film distributed by V @-@ L @-@ S @-@ E , a conglomerate created by Vitagraph Studios , Lubin Manufacturing Company , Selig Polyscope Company , and Essanay Studios . The film was also screened in a special invitation @-@ only showing at the art gallery of the Bobbs @-@ Merrill Company , publisher of MacGrath 's novel , an early example of a sponsored exhibition of a feature film in a location other than a theater . 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 The Carpet from Bagdad was released on 3 May 1915 , to generally positive reviews . Variety described it as a more interesting film than its title might imply , with " perfect direction and faultless acting " . Peter Milne of Motion Picture News approved of Campbell 's attention to detail and realism . The Moving Picture World 's James McQuade praised the film 's acting and special effects . Although he believed an unfilmed Cairo scene made Mohamed 's motivations easier to understand in the novel , he considered the film a " close second " to Campbell 's 1914 The Spoilers . Clarence Caine 's review in Motography also compared the The Carpet from Bagdad favorably to The Spoilers , but he viewed the film 's color as its best feature , especially the closing scene of a desert sunset . Several newspaper reviews also complimented the tinted desert scenes , with New Zealand 's The Levin Chronicle describing the film as " a gem of the cinematographer 's art " for its use of color . The Chicago Daily Tribune offered a more mixed opinion on the film ; reviewer Kitty Kelly found it difficult to care about characters " overshadowed by environment " , and considered the 35 @-@ year @-@ old Williams unconvincing as an ingenue . 
 Despite the acclaim from many contemporary reviewers , modern scholars of the silent film era would not consider The Carpet from Bagdad a masterpiece , according to the British Film Institute 's Clyde <unk> . 
 = = = Partial rediscovery = = = 
 Like many films from the silent era , The Carpet from Bagdad was believed completely lost , but in 1982 an Oceaneering International diving expedition salvaged a number of artifacts from the wreck of the RMS Lusitania , including one reel of film . With the assistance of BBC technical advisor Laurie Ward , the BFI National Archive was able to recover images from several feet of the film , sufficient to identify the title , but not to restore any of the film to <unk> condition . Although there was a theater on the Lusitania , this print of The Carpet from Bagdad was probably being taken to London as a film distributor 's preview , as was the case for several other films known to have been on board .

 The Central African Republic sent three competitors to the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing , China . Béranger Bosse and Mireille Derebona represented the nation in track events , while Bruno Bongongo participated on the Central African Republic 's behalf in boxing . Of those athletes , none progressed past the first rounds of their events . The appearance of the Central African delegation at the Beijing Olympics marked its eighth appearance since the nation 's debut at the 1968 Summer Olympics in Mexico City and its seventh consecutive appearance at the Summer Olympics . At the ceremonies , Derebona was the nation 's flag bearer .

 The Central African Republic is a former French colony of approximately 5 million people situated in the heart of Africa . The nation borders the Democratic Republic of the Congo for most of its southern border , the coastal nation of Cameroon to its west , South Sudan to its east , and Chad to its north . The nation declared its independence from France in 1960 . Some eight years after its independence at the Mexico City 1968 Summer Olympics , the first Central African delegation debuted in the Olympic games . It sent a single male athlete to participate at those games , and did not send another delegation again for another three Olympics . The nation returned at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles , and sent its largest delegations ( 15 athletes ) at the 1988 Summer Olympics in Seoul and the 1992 Summer Olympics in Barcelona , and sent its first female athletes to the Barcelona games . In total , the Central African Republic competed at eight games between its 1968 debut and its appearance at the 2008 Beijing Olympics . In its history up to Beijing , the Central African Republic has not sent an athlete that has won a medal . 
 Three athletes represented the Central African Republic . Two men and one woman participated across two different sports ( boxing and track and field ) and three distinct events . Mireille Derebona @-@ Ngaisset was the nation 's flag bearer at the ceremonies .

 = Holden Commodore = 
 The Holden Commodore is a car manufactured since 1978 by Holden in Australia and , formerly , in New Zealand . 
 For the original model , Holden replaced the long @-@ serving Kingswood and Premier large cars developed in Australia , with another rear wheel drive ( RWD ) platform that was , however , based on a smaller European design by Opel , re @-@ engineered for Australian conditions . Subsequent series became larger , culminating with the fourth generation Commodore , fully developed in Australia and based on the GM Zeta platform . 
 Initially introduced as a single sedan body style , the range expanded in 1979 to include a station wagon . From 1984 , Holden began branding the flagship Commodore model as Holden Calais , with the Commodore Berlina introduced in 1984 gaining independent Holden Berlina nomenclature in 1988 . Long @-@ wheelbase Statesman / Caprice derivatives and Commodore utility body variants followed in 1990 . The third generation architecture spawned the most body styles , with a new Holden utility launched in 2000 ( now officially as the Holden Ute ) , reborn Monaro coupé in 2001 , four @-@ door Holden Crewman utility and all @-@ wheel drive ( AWD ) Holden Adventra crossover in 2003 . Holden Special Vehicles ( HSV ) in 1987 began official modification of high performance variants of the Commodore and its derivatives , under its own nameplate . 
 Rivalry came predominantly from the Ford Falcon — also locally built . Prior to the second generation Commodore of 1988 , the Holden was positioned a full class below the full @-@ size Falcon . To varying degrees , competition also came from mid @-@ size offerings from Toyota Australia as well as Chrysler Australia , which morphed into Mitsubishi Motors Australia . Moreover , between 1989 and 1997 , Australian federal government policy saw the launch of the Toyota Lexcen , which was a rebadged version of the second generation Commodore . With the introduction of the third generation in 1997 , Holden implemented its largest export programs involving Commodore and its derivatives . In the Middle East , South Africa and Brazil , the Commodore sold as a Chevrolet . High @-@ performance export versions followed in North America , sold as Pontiac and later Chevrolet . HSV also exported to the United Kingdom as Vauxhall , in the Middle East as Chevrolet Special Vehicles ( CSV ) and in New Zealand and Singapore as HSV . 
 In December 2013 , Holden announced that it would cease its local production by 2017 committing , however , to use long @-@ standing Commodore nameplate on its fifth @-@ generation fully imported replacement , moving to a front @-@ wheel drive ( FWD ) platform . 
 = = First generation = = 
 = = = VB ( 1978 – 1980 ) = = = 
 Introduced in October 1978 , the VB Commodore development covered a period with the effects of the 1973 oil crisis still being felt . Hence , when Holden decided to replace the successful full @-@ size HZ Kingswood with a new model line , they wanted the new car to be smaller and more fuel efficient . Originally , Holden looked at developing a new WA Kingswood , however , this project was later dismissed . With no replacement in development , Holden looked towards Opel for providing the foundations of the VB , basing it loosely on the four @-@ cylinder Rekord E <unk> with the front grafted on from the Opel Senator A , both constructed using GM 's V @-@ body platform . This change was necessitated to accommodate the larger Holden six- and eight @-@ cylinder engines . Holden also adopted the name " Commodore " from Opel , which had been using the name since 1967 . Opel went on to use Holden 's Rekord @-@ Senator hybrid as a foundation for its new generation Commodore C , slotting in between the two donor models . 
 The VB series retained 96 percent of the preceding HZ Kingswood 's interior space , despite being 14 percent smaller in overall dimensions , although five percent larger than the Torana . With the Commodore dropping a full class below the Kingswood and its Ford Falcon competitor , the smaller Commodore was predictably more fuel @-@ efficient . This downsizing was first seen as a major disadvantage for Holden , as they had effectively relinquished the potential of selling Commodores to the fleet and taxi industries . These sales losses were thought to be unrecoverable ; however , the 1979 energy crisis saw Australian oil prices rise by 140 percent , putting substantial strain on the automotive industry to collectively downsize , a change that Holden had already done . 
 During the VB 's development , Holden realised that when driven at speed over harsh Australian roads , the Rekord would effectively break in half at the firewall . This forced Holden to rework the entire car for local conditions , resulting in only 35 percent commonality with the Opel . The Rekord 's MacPherson strut front suspension was accordingly modified , and the recirculating ball steering was replaced with a rack and pinion type . These modifications blew development costs beyond expectations to a reported A $ 110 million — a figure close to the cost of developing a new model independently . With such a large sum consumed by the VB development programme , Holden was left with insufficient finances to resource the development of a wagon variant . Added that the Commodore architecture was considered an unsuitable base for utility and long @-@ wheelbase models , Holden was left with only a sedan , albeit one in three levels of luxury : a base , SL , and SL / E. Desperate measures forced Holden to shape the Commodore front @-@ end to the rear of the Rekord wagon . As the wagon @-@ specific sheet metal had to be imported from Germany , the wagon , introduced in July 1979 , suffered from inevitable component differences from the sedan . Although infrequently criticised in the early years , quality problems were evident , with poor trim and panel fit problematic for all first generation Commodores . This coupled with mechanical dilemmas such as water pump failure and steering rack rattle ensured warranty claims were high in the first year . In face of these issues , VB was praised for its value for money and sophistication , especially in regards to the steering , ride quality , handling and brakes , thus securing the Wheels Car of the Year award for 1978 . 
 = = = VC ( 1980 – 1981 ) = = = 
 The most significant change to the VC Commodore of March 1980 was the engine upgrading to " XT5 " specification . Now painted blue and thus known as the Blue straight @-@ sixes and Holden V8s , these replaced the Red units fitted to the VB and earlier cars . Changes included a new twelve @-@ port cylinder head , re @-@ designed combustion chambers , inlet and exhaust manifolds , a new two @-@ barrel carburettor and a Bosch electronic ignition system for the inline sixes . <unk> and changes to the V8s surrounded the implementation of electronic ignition , revised cylinder head and inlet manifold design and the fitment of a four @-@ barrel carburettor on the 4 @.@ 2 @-@ litre variant . These changes brought improved efficiency , increased outputs and aided driveability . In response to increasing oil prices , a four @-@ cylinder variant was spawned in June 1980 . Displacing 1 @.@ 9 @-@ litres , this powerplant known as Starfire was effectively Holden 's existing straight @-@ six with two cylinders removed . The four 's peak power output of 58 kilowatts ( 78 hp ) and torque rated at 140 newton metres ( 100 ft · lbf ) meant its performance was compromised . Reports indicate that the need to push the engine hard to extract performance led to real @-@ world fuel consumption similar to the straight @-@ sixes . 
 Holden 's emphasis on fuel economy extended beyond powertrains , with a fuel consumption vacuum gauge replacing the tachometer throughout the range , although this could be optioned back with the sports instrumentation package . Visual changes were limited : the relocation of the corporate crest to the centre of the redesigned grille , black @-@ coloured trim applied to the tail lamp surrounds on sedans , and the <unk> of model badging into the side rubbing strips . The previously undesignated base car , was now the Commodore L , opening up the range for a new <unk> sub @-@ level car . This delete option model , was de @-@ specified and available only to fleet customers . On the premium Commodore SL / E , a resurrected " <unk> " exterior paint option became available in a limited range of dark @-@ over @-@ light colour combinations . According to contemporary reviews , changes made to the VC 's steering produced a heavier feel and inclined understeer , while the revised suspension gave a softer ride and addressed concerns raised while riding fully laden . 
 = = = VH ( 1981 – 1984 ) = = = 
 The VH series Commodore introduced in September 1981 brought moderately updated frontal bodywork , with a new bonnet and front guards to facilitate the reshaped headlamps and a horizontally slatted grille . These front @-@ end design changes worked to produce a longer , yet wider look . At the rear , sedans featured redesigned tail light clusters , the design of which borrowed from Mercedes @-@ Benz models of the day , using a louvered design . At the same time , the nomenclature of the range was rationalised . The SL superseded the L as the base model , with the old SL level becoming the mid @-@ range SL / X , and the SL / E remaining as the top @-@ of @-@ the @-@ line variant . Wagons were restricted to the SL and SL / X trims . <unk> pentagonal alloy wheels — replacing the original SL / E type used since 1978 — along with a black painted B @-@ pillar , wrap @-@ around chrome rear bumper extensions to the wheel arches , and extended tail lamps that converged with the license plate alcove — distinguished the range @-@ topping SL / E from other variants . The new pentagonal wheels were initially in short supply , such that only <unk> option SL / E sedans received them during 1981 production . 
 Mechanical specifications carried over , except for a new five @-@ speed manual transmission , optional on the 1 @.@ 9 @-@ litre four @-@ cylinder and 2 @.@ 85 @-@ litre six @-@ cylinder versions . In an attempt to improve sales figures of the inline @-@ four engine , Holden spent considerable time improving its performance and efficiency . Modifications were also made to the 2 @.@ 85 @-@ litre six to lift economy , and the powerplants managed to reduce fuel consumption by as much as 12 @.@ 5 and 14 percent , correspondingly . Holden released the sports @-@ oriented Commodore SS sedan in September 1982 — reintroducing a nameplate used briefly ten years prior with the HQ series . <unk> with a choice of <unk> or optional 5 @.@ 0 @-@ litre V8 engines , both versions of the VH SS were teamed with a four @-@ speed manual transmission . Racing driver Peter Brock 's Holden Dealer Team ( <unk> ) high performance outfit produced three upgraded versions , known as Group One , Group Two and Group Three , the latter version available in either 4 @.@ 2 @-@ litre or more commonly 5 @.@ 0 @-@ litre V8 configuration . 
 By the time of the VH series , Commodore sales were beginning to decline . Holden 's six @-@ cylinder engine , which was carried over from the Kingswood , could trace its roots back to 1963 and was no longer competitive . Continual improvements made to Commodore 's Ford Falcon rival meant the VH was not significantly more fuel @-@ efficient or better performing despite the smaller size . This was curtailed by the absence of any major powertrain revisions by the time of the VH and the lack of visual departure from the original VB . Holden also had to deal with the influx of their own mid @-@ size Camira from 1982 , which presented comparable interior volume with lower fuel consumption , and for less than the Commodore pricing point . Camira sales were strong initially , but as fuel prices had stabilised , buyers gravitated away from Camira and Commodore towards the larger Falcon , which overtook the Commodore as Australia 's bestselling car for the first time in 1982 . 
 = = = VK ( 1984 – 1986 ) = = = 
 Representing the first major change since the VB original , the VK model of 1984 introduced a six @-@ window glasshouse , as opposed to the previous four @-@ window design , to make the Commodore appear larger . The revised design helped stimulate sales , which totalled 135 @,@ 000 in two years . This did not put an end to Holden 's monetary woes . Sales of the initially popular Camira slumped due to unforeseen quality issues , while the Holden WB series commercial vehicle range and the Statesman WB luxury models were starting to show their age ; their 1971 origins compared unfavourably with Ford 's more modern Falcon and Fairlane models . 
 New names for the trim levels were also introduced , such as Commodore Executive ( an SL with air conditioning and automatic transmission ) , Commodore Berlina ( replacing SL / X ) and Calais ( replacing SL / E ) . The 3 @.@ 3 @-@ litre Blue straight @-@ six engine was replaced by the Black specification , gaining computer @-@ controlled ignition system on the carburettor versions and optional electronic fuel injection boosting power output to 106 kilowatts ( 142 hp ) . The 5 @.@ 0 @-@ litre V8 engine continued to power high specification variants , but was shrunk from <unk> cc to <unk> cc in 1985 due to new Group A racing homologation rules . The new unit cut its predecessor 's weight by 75 kilograms ( 165 lb ) and models were fitted with an upgraded braking system . As high oil prices became a thing of the past , Holden decided to drop the <unk> six and 4 @.@ 2 @-@ litre V8 , while the 1 @.@ 9 @-@ litre four @-@ cylinder was limited to New Zealand . 
 = = = VL ( 1986 – 1988 ) = = = 
 Marking a high point in terms of sales , the last @-@ of @-@ the @-@ series VL Commodore sold in record numbers , finally managing to outsell the Ford Falcon in the private sector . The 1986 VL represented a substantial makeover of the VK and would be the last of the mid @-@ size Commodores . Designers distanced the Commodore further away from its Opel origins , by smoothing the lines of the outer body and incorporating a subtle tail spoiler . A thorough redesign of the nose saw the Commodore gain sleek , narrow headlamps and a shallower grille , while the Calais specification employed unique partially concealed headlamps . 
 By this stage , Holden 's 24 ‑ year ‑ old six @-@ cylinder was thoroughly outmoded and would have been difficult to re @-@ engineer to comply with pending emission standards and the introduction of unleaded fuel . This led Holden to sign a deal with Nissan of Japan to import their <unk> engine . This seemed a good idea in 1983 when the Australian dollar was strong ; however by 1986 the once viable prospect became rather expensive . The public quickly accepted what was at first a controversial move , as reports emerged of the improvements in refinement , 33 percent gain in power and 15 percent better economy over the carburettor version of the VK 's Black straight @-@ six . An optional turbocharger appeared six months later and lifted power output to 150 kilowatts ( 200 hp ) . In October 1986 , an unleaded edition of Holden ’ s <unk> V8 engine was publicised . Holden had originally planned to discontinue the V8 to spare the engineering expense of converting to unleaded . However , public outcry persuaded them to relent . <unk> in New Zealand were also available with the 2 @.@ 0 @-@ litre six @-@ cylinder <unk> engine . 
 The VL suffered from some common build quality problems , such as poor windshield sealing , that can lead to water leakages and corrosion . Awkward packaging under the low bonnet coupled with Holden 's decision to utilise a cross @-@ flow radiator ( as opposed to the up @-@ down flow radiator installed to the equivalent Nissan Skyline ) meant the six @-@ cylinder engine was especially susceptible to cracked cylinder heads , a problem not displayed on the Nissan Skyline with which it shares the <unk> engine . The Used Car Safety Ratings , published in 2008 by the Monash University Accident Research Centre , found that first generation Commodores ( VB – VL ) provide a " worse than average " level of occupant safety protection in the event of an accident . 
 = = Second generation = = 
 = = = VN ( 1988 – 1991 ) = = = 
 The VN Commodore of 1988 and subsequent second generation models took their bodywork from the larger Opel Senator B and new Opel Omega A. However , this time , the floor plan was widened and stretched ; now matching the rival Ford Falcon for size . Continuing financial woes at Holden meant the wider VN body was underpinned by narrow , carry @-@ over VL chassis components in a bid to save development costs . In the VN and succeeding models , the Commodore Berlina became known simply as the Berlina . The range expanded in 1990 to include a utility variant , given the model designation VG . This was built on a longer @-@ wheelbase platform that it shared with the station wagon and luxury <unk> Statesman sedans released earlier in the year . During this time , the rival Ford EA Falcon was plagued with initial quality issues which tarnished its reputation . Buyers embraced the VN Commodore , helping Holden to recover and post an operating profit of A $ 157 @.@ 3 million for 1989 . The team at Wheels magazine awarded the VN Car of the Year in 1988 : the second Commodore model to receive this award . 
 Changes in the relative values of the Australian dollar and Japanese yen made it financially impractical to continue with the well @-@ regarded Nissan engine of the VL . Instead , Holden manufactured their own 3 @.@ 8 @-@ litre V6 engine based on a Buick design , adapted from FWD to RWD . The 5 @.@ 0 @-@ litre V8 remained optional and received a power boost to 165 kilowatts ( 221 hp ) courtesy of multi @-@ point fuel injection . Although not known for its refinement , the new V6 was nevertheless praised for its performance and fuel efficiency at the time . A 2 @.@ 0 @-@ litre Family II engine was also offered for some export markets including New Zealand and Singapore where it was sold as the Holden Berlina . Accompanying the changes to engines , the VL 's four @-@ speed automatic transmission was replaced by the Turbo @-@ <unk> and a Borg @-@ Warner five @-@ speed manual . A Series II update of the VN appeared in September 1989 , featuring a revised V6 engine known internally as the <unk> . With the update came a power hike of rising to 127 kilowatts ( 170 hp ) from 125 kilowatts ( 168 hp ) . 
 Under an unsuccessful model sharing arrangement that was part of the Hawke Labor government reforms in 1989 , which saw the formation of the United Australian Automobile Industries alliance between Holden and Toyota Australia , the latter began selling badge engineered versions of the VN Commodore manufactured by Holden . The rebadged Commodores were sold as the Toyota Lexcen , named after Ben Lexcen who was the designer of Australia II yacht that won the 1983 America 's Cup . The original T1 Lexcen offered sedan and station wagon body forms in three levels of trim : base , GL and <unk> . Moreover , they were only available with 3 @.@ 8 @-@ litre V6 engine and automatic transmission combination . 
 = = = VP ( 1991 – 1993 ) = = = 
 The VP update of 1991 featured cosmetic changes and mechanical however most were not visible unless you were to pull the motor down ; and a very similar revised 3 @.@ 8 @-@ litre V6 and 5 @.@ 0 @-@ litre V8 engines from the VN were carried over . The 2 @.@ 0 @-@ litre straight @-@ four engine previously available in New Zealand was discontinued . Exterior cosmetic changes included a translucent acrylic grille on the base level Executive and Berlina , with a colour @-@ coded grille for the S and SS , and a chrome grille for Calais . Updated tail lights and boot garnishes were also a part of the changes , which were different for each model , with the Berlina having grey stripes and the Calais chrome stripes . Semi @-@ trailing arm independent rear suspension became standard on the Calais and SS , but was made an option on lower @-@ end models in lieu of the live rear axle , improving ride and handling . 
 A new wider front track was introduced to address issues with the previous carried @-@ over VL chassis components . In August 1992 , anti @-@ lock brakes were introduced as an option on the Calais and SS trim levels , later becoming optional on all Series II variants . This January 1993 update also included a colour @-@ coded grille for the Executive and alloy wheels for the Commodore S. 
 Toyota 's pattern of updating their Lexcen model tended to follow Commodore 's model cycle . The T2 ( VP ) Lexcen from 1991 pioneered new specification designations : <unk> , <unk> and Newport . All future updates ( T3 ( VR ) , T4 ( VS ) and T5 ( VS II ) Lexcens ) made use of the new naming system until 1997 , when the badge engineering scheme ceased . To give further differentiation to the Lexcen from the Commodore , the Lexcens from the VP model onwards had unique front @-@ end styling treatments . 
 = = = VR ( 1993 – 1995 ) = = = 
 The 1993 VR Commodore represented a major facelift of the second generation architecture leaving only the doors and roof untouched . Approximately 80 percent of car was new in comparison to the preceding model . Exterior changes brought an overall smoother body , semicircular wheel arches and the " twin @-@ kidney " grille — a Commodore styling trait which remained until the VY model of 2002 and remains a permanent staple on the HSV variants to this day . The rear @-@ end treatment saw raised tail lights , implemented for safety reasons , and a driver 's side airbag was introduced as an option : a first for an Australian @-@ built car . Other safety features such as anti @-@ lock brakes and independent rear suspension were only available with the new electronic GM 4L60 @-@ E automatic transmission . Along with a driver 's airbag and cruise control , these features were packaged into a new Acclaim specification level : a family @-@ oriented safety spec above the entry @-@ level Executive . Holden 's strong focus on safety can be seen in the Used Car Safety Ratings . The findings show that in an accident , VN / VP Commodores provide a " worse than average " level of occupant protection . However , the updated VR / VS models were found to provide a " better than average " level of safety protection . Holden issued a Series II revision in September 1994 bringing audible warning chimes for the handbrake and fuel level among other changes . 
 The latest revision of the Buick 3 @.@ 8 @-@ litre V6 engine was fitted to the VR Commodore , featuring rolling @-@ element bearings in the valve rocker arms and increased compression ratios . These changes combined to deliver an increase in power to 130 kilowatts ( 170 hp ) and further improvement in noise , vibration , and harshness levels . Wheels magazine awarded the VR Commodore Car of the Year in 1993 . 
 = = = VS ( 1995 – 1997 ) = = = 
 The 1995 VS Commodore served as a mechanical update of the VR , destined to maintain sales momentum before the arrival of an all @-@ new VT model . The extent of exterior changes amounted to little more than a redesigned Holden logo and wheel trims . An overhauled Ecotec ( Emissions and Consumption <unk> through <unk> ) version of the Buick V6 engine coincided with changes to the engine in the United States . The Ecotec engine packed 13 percent more power for a total of 147 kilowatts ( 197 hp ) , cut fuel consumption by 5 percent , increased the compression ratio from 9 @.@ 0 : 1 to 9 @.@ 4 : 1 and improved on the engine 's previous rough characteristics . Holden mated the new engine with a modified version of the GM 4L60 @-@ E automatic transmission , improving throttle response and smoothing gear changes . The Series II update of June 1996 included elliptical side turn signals , interior tweaks and the introduction of a supercharged V6 engine for selected trim levels , and the introduction of a new <unk> manual transmission . The new supercharged engine slotted between the existing V6 and V8 engines in the lineup and was officially rated at 165 kilowatts ( 221 hp ) , just 3 kilowatts ( 4 @.@ 0 hp ) below the V8 . 
 The VS Commodore was the last of which to be sold as Toyota Lexcens , as Holden and Toyota ended their model @-@ sharing scheme . The last Lexcens were built during 1997 . This model was also sold as the VS Commodore Royale in New Zealand . Similar in specification to the Calais also sold in New Zealand , the Royale featured a standard VS Commodore body with the front end from the VS Caprice and an Opel 2 @.@ 6 @-@ litre 54 @-@ Degree V6 engine . The Royale was also sold between 1995 and 1997 in small numbers to Malaysia and Singapore as the Opel Calais . 
 = = Third generation = = 
 = = = VT ( 1997 – 2000 ) = = = 
 With the VT Commodore of 1997 , Holden looked again to Opel in Germany for a donor platform . The proposal was to take the Opel Omega B and broaden the vehicle 's width and mechanical setup for local conditions . In the early days , Holden considered adopting the Omega as is , save for the engines and transmissions , and even investigated <unk> the existing VR / VS architecture . Later on , the VT bodywork spawned a new generation of Statesman and Caprice ( again based on the long @-@ wheelbase wagons ) , and even went as far as resurrecting the iconic Monaro coupé of the 1960s and 1970s via a prototype presented at the 1998 Sydney Motor Show . 
 The VT heralded the fitment of semi @-@ trailing arm independent rear suspension as standard across the range , a significant selling point over the rival Falcon , along with increased electronics such as Traction Control . However , in terms of suspension , the original Opel design was simplified by removing the toe control links that was standard equipment on the European Omega since 1987 . Consequently , this afflicted the VT with excessive tyre wear due to distortions to the suspension camber angle and toe under heavy load , such as heavy towing or when travelling over undulated surfaces . 
 Notably , Holden 's performance arm HSV re @-@ added the toe control link on the flagship GTS 300 model . The 1999 Series II update replaced the venerable Holden 5 @.@ 0 @-@ litre V8 engine with a new 5 @.@ 7 @-@ litre Generation III V8 sourced from the United States . The V8 was detuned to 220 kilowatts ( 300 hp ) from the original US version , but would receive incremental power upgrades to 250 kilowatts ( 340 hp ) throughout its time in the Commodore , before finally being replaced by the related Generation 4 in the VZ . The supercharged V6 was uprated to 171 kilowatts ( 229 hp ) from the VS . Safety wise , side airbags became an option for the Acclaim and higher models , a first for Holden . 
 From the onset , parent company General Motors was interested in incorporating a left @-@ hand drive Commodore in its Buick lineup , as manifested by the unveiling of the Buick <unk> concept car in 1996 . Although this idea was ultimately abandoned ( due to pressures by the North American automotive trade unions to retain local production ) , the GM @-@ funded project allowed Holden to enter into a range of left @-@ hand export markets . Thus began the Commodore 's rapid expansion into parts of Indochina , the Middle East and South Africa badged as the Chevrolet Lumina and Brazil as the Chevrolet Omega 3 @.@ 8 V6 . In its home market , the VT series was awarded the 1997 Wheels Car of the Year award , the fourth such award in Commodore 's history . It found ready acceptance in the market as many buyers steered away from the slow selling Ford AU Falcon , becoming the best selling Commodore to date and cementing its place as number one in Australian sales . 
 The sedan and wagon range comprised : Commodore Executive ( base and fleet package ) ; Commodore Acclaim ( family and safety package ) ; Berlina ( luxury package ) and Calais ( sedan @-@ only sport luxury package ) . Limited editions included a " Sydney 2000 " Olympic version and Holden 50th Anniversary based on better equipped Executive models ( e.g. Berlina alloy wheels on the former but no climate control ) . 
 = = = VX ( 2000 – 2002 ) = = = 
 The VX update from 2000 featured a revised headlamp design . The VT 's rear tail lamp panel was replaced by two separate light assemblies . Conversely , the luxury @-@ oriented Berlina and Calais sedans continued using a full @-@ width boot @-@ lid panel incorporating the registration plate and tail lamps . 
 The VX series also formed the basis for a new Holden Ute , designated the VU @-@ series . Earlier utility models were instead entitled " Commodore utility " . An updated Series II was launched in early 2002 , featuring revised rear suspension system now equipped with toe control links to address the VT 's issues . The VX series also spawned the production version of the re @-@ launched Holden Monaro ( allowing Holden to commence exports to the United States , with this coupé sold as the Pontiac GTO ) . 
 Safety played a substantial role in the development of the VX model . Bosch 5 @.@ 3 anti @-@ lock brakes were made standard on all variants , a first for an Australian manufactured car ; and traction control was made available on vehicles equipped with manual transmission . Extensive research was undertaken to reduce the effects from a side @-@ impact collision through modification of the B @-@ pillars . The risk presented by a side @-@ impact collision in a VX fitted without side airbags is reduced by 50 percent when compared to a similarly specified VT model . 
 = = = VY ( 2002 – 2004 ) = = = 
 The A $ 250 million VY mid @-@ cycle update of 2002 represented the first major styling shift since the 1997 VT . Designers discarded the rounded front and rear styling of the VT and VX models , adopting more aggressive , angular lines . The same approach was applied to the interior , whereby the curvaceous dashboard design was orphaned in favour of an angular , symmetrical design . Satin chrome plastic now dominated the façade of the centre console stack , and high @-@ end models received fold @-@ out cup holders borrowed from fellow GM subsidiary Saab . Leaving <unk> behind , Holden turned towards German electronics manufacturer Blaupunkt to source audio systems — an arrangement that remains in place today . 
 Engineering wise , Holden kept the changes low key . A revised steering system and tweaked suspension tuning were among some of the changes to sharpen handling precision . Further improvements were made to the Generation III V8 engine to produce peak power of 235 kilowatts ( 315 hp ) for sports variants . In a bid to recapture the market for low @-@ cost , high @-@ performance cars , Holden created a new SV8 specification level . Based on the entry @-@ level Executive , the SV8 inherited the V8 mechanical package from the SS but made do without the luxury appointments and was sold at a correspondingly lower price . Holden also experimented by releasing a limited edition wagon version of its high @-@ performance SS variant , of which only 850 were built . The Series II update added a front strut bar as standard to the SS , which was claimed to increase rigidity and hence handling . As became the trend , the update raised V8 power , now up 10 kilowatts ( 13 hp ) . Amendments in the remaining models were confined to new wheels , trims and decals , however , the Calais has taken on a sports @-@ luxury persona as opposed to the discrete luxury character seen in previous models . This repositioning in turn affected the Berlina 's standing . The once second @-@ tier model now became the sole luxury model , only overshadowed by the more expensive Calais . Coinciding with the VY II models was the first four @-@ door utility model dubbed the Holden Crewman . Crewman 's underpinnings and body structure while somewhat unique , shared a fair amount in common with the Statesman / Caprice , One <unk> and the two @-@ door Ute . 
 In 2003 , Holden launched an AWD system that it developed for the VY platform dubbed Cross <unk> , at a cost of A $ 125 million . Unveiled after the Series II updates , the first application of this electronically controlled system was the Holden Adventra , a raised VY wagon crossover . The system was only available in combination with the V8 and automatic transmission . Holden chose not to spend extra engineering resources on adapting the AWD system to the 3 @.@ 8 @-@ litre V6 , due to be replaced in the upcoming VZ model . Unfortunately for Holden , the Adventra fell well short of expected sales , despite modest targets . 
 = = = VZ ( 2004 – 2006 ) = = = 
 The final chapter of the third generation series was the VZ Commodore . Debuting in 2004 with a new series of V6 engines known as the Alloytec V6 , both 175 kilowatts ( 235 hp ) and 190 kilowatts ( 250 hp ) versions of the 3 @.@ 6 @-@ litre engine were offered . These were later upgraded to 180 and 195 kilowatts ( 241 and 261 hp ) respectively in the VE model . When compared to the previous Ecotec engines , the Alloytec benefits from increased power output , responsiveness and fuel efficiency . The new engines were mated to a new five @-@ speed <unk> automatic transmission on the luxury V6 variants , and a new six @-@ speed Aisin <unk> manual transmission on the six @-@ cylinder SV6 sports variant . However , the long serving four @-@ speed automatic carried on in other variants , albeit with further tweaks in an attempt to address complaints about refinement . A new 6 @.@ 0 @-@ litre Generation 4 V8 engine was added to the range in January 2006 to comply with Euro III emission standards . Compared to the American version , both Active Fuel Management and variable valve timing were removed . The Alloytec V6 was also affected by the new standards , which saw the peak output reduced to 172 kilowatts ( 231 hp ) . 
 Along with the new powertrain , Holden also introduced new safety features such as electronic stability control and brake assist . The Used Car Safety Ratings evaluation found that VT / VX Commodores provide a " better than average " level of occupant protection in the event of an accident , with VY / VZ models uprated to " significantly better than average " . Interestingly , ANCAP crash test results rate the fourth generation VE lower in the offset frontal impact test than the third generation VY / VZ Commodore . The overall crash score was marginally higher than the outgoing model due to improved side impact protection .

 Launched in 2006 after GM 's 2003 abandonment of their last European rear @-@ drive sedan , the Opel Omega , the VE is the first Commodore model designed entirely in Australia , as opposed to being based on an adapted Opel @-@ sourced platform . Given this and high public expectations of quality , the budget in developing the car reportedly exceeded A $ 1 billion . <unk> by the new Holden developed GM Zeta platform , the VE features more sophisticated independent suspension all round and near @-@ even 50 : 50 weight distribution , leading to improved handling . Engines and transmissions are largely carried over from the previous VZ model . However , a new six @-@ speed GM <unk> @-@ E automatic transmission was introduced for V8 variants , replacing the old four @-@ speed automatic now relegated to base models . The design of this new model included innovative features to help minimise export costs , such as a symmetrical centre console that houses a flush @-@ fitting hand brake lever to facilitate its conversion to left @-@ hand drive . Internationally , the Commodore is again badge engineered as the Chevrolet Lumina and Chevrolet Omega , along with its new export market in the United States as the Pontiac G8 ( discontinued as of 2010 along with the Pontiac brand ) . 
 Variants by Holden 's performance arm , HSV , were released soon after the sedan 's debut , followed by the long @-@ wheelbase WM Statesman / Caprice models . The VE Ute did not enter production until 2007 whilst the Sportwagon began production in July 2008 . Since its release , the VE has been awarded Wheels Car of the Year , being the fifth Commodore model to do so . 
 In late 2008 Holden made changes to the VE Commodore , including the addition of a passenger seatbelt @-@ reminder system . The rollout of such modifications allowed the VE range to be upgraded in stages ( dependent on model ) to the five @-@ star ANCAP safety rating during 2008 and 2009 . 
 The September 2009 MY10 update to the VE Commodore platform introduces a new standard engine – a 3 @.@ 0 @-@ litre Spark Ignition Direct Injection ( SIDI ) V6 on the Omega and Berlina , with a 3 @.@ 6 @-@ litre version of the same reserved for all other V6 variants . The standard transmission is now a six @-@ speed GM <unk> automatic , replacing the four @-@ speed in Omega and Berlina models and the five @-@ speed in higher luxury levels . A six @-@ speed manual is still available in sport models . Holden claims the new powertrains will provide better fuel economy than some smaller four @-@ cylinder cars ; the 3 @.@ 0 @-@ litre version is rated at 9 @.@ 3 L / 100 km ( 25 mpg @-@ US ; 30 mpg @-@ imp ) . However , economy tests performed by various motoring organisations have yielded varying results . 
 In mid @-@ 2010 Holden released the VE Series 2 ( <unk> ) . The major difference saw the introduction of the Holden iQ system , a centre @-@ mounted LCD display that provides navigation , bluetooth , and controls to the stereo . There were also small alterations to the styling and other minor changes . 
 = = = VF ( 2013 – present ) = = = 
 The VF Commodore , a major overhaul of the VE , was officially revealed on 10 February 2013 in Melbourne . 
 The body shell , suspension and electrics of the GM Zeta platform have been thoroughly reworked to reduce weight , improving handling and fuel efficiency . Changes to the model line @-@ up see the deletion of the Berlina nameplate ( which was merged with the standard Calais variant , represented the smallest share of sales in Commodore 's line @-@ up ) and the base model renamed from Omega to Evoke . 
 Standard features across the Commodore range includes front and rear parking sensors , reverse camera and auto park assist , whereas high specifications models such as the Calais @-@ V and SS @-@ V redline models also feature , as standard , forward and reverse collision alert system and a colour heads @-@ up display - all possible thanks to the VF 's electronics now being compatible with those of more developed GM cars , resulting in the new Commodore being cheaper to manufacture . Indeed , recommended retail pricing have been reduced across the range , from A $ 5 @,@ 000 for the base model and up to A $ 10 @,@ 000 for the Calais V V8 and SS V Redline . 
 A day after the Australian range reveal and in the lead up to the Daytona 500 weekend , a more powerful and better equipped export version of the VF Commodore SS also made its debut in Daytona , Florida , as the <unk> Chevrolet SS . To maximise the SS 's profile in the United States , GM also replaced in NASCAR the silhouette of the Chevrolet Impala with that of the SS . 
 A Series II update ( VF II ) was launched in late 2015 , introducing minor styling revisions at the front , while the biggest change was the arrival of a 304 kW ( 408 hp ) LS3 across the entire V8 range . In addition , the SS Redline V 's gear ratios and the Redline 's suspension tune were also revised . 
 = = Fifth generation = = 
 Initial speculation in 2013 — which followed Holden 's announcement of its intention to cease local Australian production — suggested that Commodore 's fully imported FWD replacement would be based on a GM vehicle designed by Holden and built in China for the Chinese market . In January 2015 , however , automotive journalists claimed the Commodore replacement would be a local adaptation of the next generation Opel Insignia imported from Europe . 
 Also in January 2015 , Holden confirmed that the Commodore badge will be inherited by the fully imported replacement . This decision was made on the basis of a survey revealing that a majority of customers were in favour of retaining the long @-@ standing Australian badge introduced in 1978 . 
 By November 2015 , the fifth @-@ generation Commodore was now believed to be a rebadged version of the third @-@ generation Buick <unk> , which was presented at that month 's Los Angeles <unk> . 
 = = Australian export models = = 
 Since the late 1990s , Commodores have been sent abroad as the Chevrolet Lumina in the Middle East until 2011 and South Africa until 2012 , and as the Chevrolet Omega in Brazil until 2008 and , then again , in 2010 . Vauxhall VXR8 sales began in 2007 . Versions have also been previously exported in the mid @-@ 1990s to Southeast Asia as the Opel Calais and to North America from 2007 to 2009 as the Pontiac G8 . As of June 2014 , the VF Commodore is sold in North America as the Chevrolet SS . 
 = = = Chevrolet Lumina = = = 
 Since 1998 , the Holden Commodore has been sold as the Chevrolet Lumina in the Middle East and South Africa , and previously in South East Asia . 
 A coupe version based on the Holden Monaro was also sold in the Middle East as the Chevrolet Lumina Coupe . In Arabia , the Lumina was offered in four different trims : LS ( Omega ) , LTZ ( Berlina ) , S ( SV6 ) and SS ( SS ) . The LTZ and S comes standard with a <unk> Alloytec V6 and a 6 @-@ speed automatic transmission for the S and 4 @-@ speed for the LTZ , while the SS comes standard with <unk> Alloytec V8 with the option of Active Fuel management . A 6 @-@ speed manual is standard with the option of a 6 @-@ speed Automatic on SS . The LTZ was the luxury model , while the S and SS models focused on <unk> . Exports to the Middle East ceased in 2011 . 
 Lumina models sold in South Africa received updates for the 2011 model year . These changes were introduced to coincide with the release of the VE Series II Commodore . Changes include revised bumpers , there is a chrome moulding above the number plate on the boot lid , refreshed alloy wheel designs and the Holden IQ system . Also the SSV model was introduced . The Holden Ute is sold as the Lumina Ute in South Africa . 
 = = Australian production = = 
 Australian production of the first Commodore launched in 1978 was initially spread between Holden 's Pagewood ( NSW ) and Dandenong ( Vic ) plants . In August 1978 , Holden announced a $ 6 @.@ 7 million program to enable assembly of the Commodore range at the Elizabeth ( SA ) plant , which resulted in the closure of the Pagewood plant a year later . The Australian production of the Commodore was consolidated at Elizabeth in 1988 , coinciding with the launch of the then new VN Commodore . 
 The Commodore and its derivatives have been the basis of modified variants by companies separate to Holden . Officially , Holden 's performance partner is HSV , although other prominent high performance brands include <unk> Special Vehicles , Corsa Specialized Vehicles ( CSV ) and Walkinshaw Performance ( WP ) , since the first , third and fourth generation Commodore , respectively . 
 In December 2013 , Holden announced that it will cease production of the Commodore in Australia in 2017 . This was followed , in December 2015 , by " Project Erich " involving Belgian entrepreneur Guido Dumarey . His plans involve buying the Holden production facilities , with a view to continue producing in Australia a rebadged range of RWD and AWD premium vehicles based on the GM Zeta platform , for local and export sales . Dumarey 's company , Punch Powerglide , already supplies automatic transmissions for Holden 's V6 @-@ powered models made in Australia .

 Queen Anne 's War ( 1702 – 1713 ) , as the North American theater of the War of the Spanish Succession was known in the British colonies , was the second in a series of French and Indian Wars fought between France and England , later Great Britain , in North America for control of the continent . The War of the Spanish Succession was primarily fought in Europe . In addition to the two main combatants , the war also involved numerous Native American tribes allied with each nation , and Spain , which was allied with France . It was also known as the Third Indian War or in French as the Second Intercontinental War . 
 The war was fought on three fronts : 
 Spanish Florida and the English Province of Carolina were each subjected to attacks from the other , and the English engaged the French based at Mobile in what was essentially a proxy war involving primarily allied Native Americans on both sides . The southern war , although it did not result in significant territorial changes , had the effect of nearly wiping out the Native population of Spanish Florida , including parts of present @-@ day southern Georgia , and destroying Spain 's network of missions in the area . 
 The English colonies of New England fought with French and Native American forces based in Acadia and Canada . Quebec City was repeatedly targeted ( but never successfully reached ) by British expeditions , and the Acadian capital Port Royal was taken in 1710 . The French and Wabanaki Confederacy sought to thwart New England expansion into Acadia , whose border New France defined as the Kennebec River in southern Maine . Toward this end , they executed raids against targets in Massachusetts ( including present @-@ day Maine ) , most famously raiding Deerfield in 1704 . 
 On Newfoundland , English colonists based at St. John 's disputed control of the island with the French based at Plaisance . Most of the conflict consisted of economically destructive raids against the other side 's settlements . The French successfully captured St. John 's in 1709 , but the British quickly reoccupied it after the French abandoned it . 
 Following a preliminary peace in 1712 , the Treaty of Utrecht ended the war in 1713 . It resulted in the French cession of claims to the territories of Hudson Bay , Acadia , and Newfoundland to Britain , while retaining Cape Breton and other islands in the Gulf of St. Lawrence . Some of its terms were ambiguous , and concerns of various Native American tribes were not included in the treaty , setting the stage for future conflicts .

 In 1701 , following the death in late 1700 of King Charles II , war broke out over who should succeed him to the Spanish throne . Although the war was at first restricted to a few powers in Europe , in May 1702 it widened when England declared war on Spain and France . The hostilities in North America were further encouraged by existing frictions along the frontier areas separating the colonies of these powers . This dis @-@ harmony was most pronounced along the northern and southwestern frontiers of the English colonies , which then stretched from the Province of Carolina in the south to the Province of Massachusetts Bay in the north , with additional colonial settlements or trading outposts on Newfoundland and at Hudson Bay . 
 The total population of the English colonies at the time has been estimated at 250 @,@ 000 , with Virginia and New England dominating . The population centers of these colonies were concentrated along the coast , with small settlements inland , sometimes reaching as far as the Appalachian Mountains . Most European colonists knew very little of the interior of the continent , to the west of the Appalachians and south of the Great Lakes . This area was dominated by native tribes , although French and English traders had penetrated the area . Spanish missionaries in La Florida had established a network of missions to convert the indigenous inhabitants to Roman Catholicism . The Spanish population was relatively small ( about 1 @,@ 500 ) , and the native population they ministered to has been estimated to number 20 @,@ 000 . French explorers had located the mouth of the Mississippi River , near which they established a small colonial presence in 1699 at Fort Maurepas ( near present @-@ day Biloxi , Mississippi ) . From there they began to establish trade routes into the interior , establishing friendly relations with the Choctaw , a large tribe whose natural enemies included the British @-@ allied Chickasaw . All of these populations had suffered to some degree from the introduction of Eurasian infectious diseases like smallpox by early explorers and traders . 
 The arrival of the French in the South threatened existing trade links that Carolina colonists had established into the interior , and Spanish territorial claims , creating tension among all three powers . France and Spain , allies in this conflict , had been on opposite sides of the recently ended Nine Years ' War . Conflicting territorial claims between Carolina and Florida south of the Savannah River were overlaid by animosity over religious divisions between the Roman Catholic Spanish and the Protestant English along the coast . 
 To the north , the conflict held a strong economic component in addition to territorial disputes . Newfoundland was the site of a British colony based at St. John 's , and the French colonial base was at Plaisance , with both sides also holding a number of smaller permanent settlements . The island also had many seasonal settlements used by fishermen from Europe . These colonists , numbering fewer than 2 @,@ 000 English and 1 @,@ 000 French permanent settlers ( and many more seasonal visitors ) , competed with one another for the fisheries of the Grand Banks , which were also used by fishermen from Acadia ( then encompassing all of present @-@ day Nova Scotia and New Brunswick ) and Massachusetts . 
 The border area between Acadia and New England remained uncertain despite battles along the border throughout King William 's War . New France defined the border of Acadia as the Kennebec River in southern Maine . There were Catholic missions at Norridgewock and Penobscot and a French settlement in Penobscot Bay near the site of modern Castine , Maine , which had all been bases for attacks on New England settlers migrating toward Acadia during King William 's War . The frontier areas between the Saint Lawrence River and the primarily coastal settlements of Massachusetts and New York were still dominated by natives ( primarily Abenaki and Iroquois ) , and the Hudson River – Lake Champlain corridor had also been used for raiding expeditions in both directions in earlier conflicts . Although the threat of natives had receded somewhat because of reductions in the population as a result of disease and the last war , they were still seen to pose a potent threat to outlying settlements . 
 The Hudson Bay territories ( known to the English as Prince Rupert 's Land ) were not significantly fought over in this war . Although they had been a scene of much dispute by competing French and English companies starting in the 1680s , the 1697 Treaty of Ryswick left France in control of all but one outpost on the bay . The only incident of note was a French attack on that outpost , Fort Albany , in 1709 . The Hudson 's Bay Company , unhappy that Ryswick had not returned its territories , successfully lobbied for the return of its territories in the negotiations that ended this war . 
 = = Technology and organization = = 
 Military technology used in North America was not as developed as it was in Europe . Only a few colonial settlements had stone fortifications ( among them St. Augustine , Boston , Quebec , and St. John 's ) at the start of the war , although Port Royal 's fortifications were completed early in the war . Some frontier villages were protected by wooden palisades , but many had little more than fortified wooden houses with gun ports through which defenders could fire , and overhanging second floors from which they might fire down on attackers trying to break in below . Europeans were typically armed with smooth @-@ bore muskets that had a maximum range of about 100 yards ( 91 m ) , but were inaccurate at ranges beyond half that distance . Some colonists also carried pikes , while tribal warriors were either supplied with European arms , or were armed with more primitive weapons like tomahawks and bows and arrows . A small number of colonists had training in the operation of cannon and other types of artillery ; these were the only effective weapons for attacking significant stone or wooden defenses . 
 English colonists were generally organized into militia companies , and their colonies had no regular military presence beyond a small number in some of the communities of Newfoundland . The French colonists were also organized into militias , but they also had a standing defense force called the troupes de la marine . This force consisted of some experienced officers , and was manned by recruits sent over from France . Numbering between 500 and 1 @,@ 200 , they were spread throughout the territories of New France , with concentrations in the major population centers . Spanish Florida was defended by a few hundred regular troops ; Spanish policy was to pacify the natives in their territory and not to provide them with weapons . This policy had devastating consequences : before the war , Florida held an estimated 8 @,@ 000 natives , but this was reduced to 200 after English raids made early in the war .

 Prominent French and English colonists understood at the turn of the 18th century that control of the Mississippi River would have a significant role in future development and trade , and each developed visionary plans to thwart the other 's activities . The French Canadian explorer Pierre Le Moyne d 'Iberville had , in the aftermath of the last war , developed a " Project sur la Caroline " that called for establishing relationships with natives in the Mississippi watershed and then leveraging those relationships to push the English off the continent , or at least limit them to coastal areas . In pursuit of this grand strategy he rediscovered the mouth of the Mississippi ( which had first been found by La Salle in 1670 ) , and established Fort Maurepas in 1699 . From this base , and Fort Louis de la Mobile ( founded in 1702 ) , he began to establish relationships with the local Choctaw , Chickasaw , Natchez , and other tribes . 
 English traders and explorers from Carolina had , since its founding in 1670 , already established a substantial trading network across the southeastern part of the continent that extended all the way to the Mississippi . Its leaders , who had little respect for the Spanish in Florida , understood the threat posed by the French arrival on the coast . Both Joseph Blake , Carolina 's governor until his death in 1700 , and James Moore , who succeeded Blake in 1702 , articulated visions of expansion to the south and west at the expense of French and Spanish interests . 
 In January 1702 , before the war broke out in Europe , Iberville had approached the Spanish with the recommendation that the Apalachee warriors be armed and sent against the English and their allies . The Spanish organized an expedition under Francisco Romo de Uriza that left Pensacola in August for the trading centers of the Carolina backcountry . The English , with advance warning of the expedition , organized a defense at the head of the Flint River and routed the Spanish @-@ led force , with upwards of 500 Spanish @-@ led natives killed or captured . 
 When formal notification of hostilities arrived , Governor Moore organized and led a force against Spanish Florida . In the 1702 Siege of St. Augustine , 500 English soldiers and militia along with 300 Indians captured and burned the town of St. Augustine . The English were unable to take the main fortress , and withdrew when a Spanish fleet arrived from Havana . In 1706 Carolina successfully repulsed an attack on Charles Town by a combined Spanish and French amphibious force sent from Havana . 
 The Apalachee and Timucua of Spanish Florida were virtually wiped out in a raiding expedition by Moore that became known as the Apalachee Massacre of 1704 . Many of the survivors of these raids were relocated to the Savannah River , where they were confined to reservations . Raids consisting of large native forces , sometimes including a small number of white men , continued in the following years , including major expeditions directed at Pensacola in 1707 and Mobile in 1709 . The Muscogee ( Creek ) , Yamasee , and Chickasaw , armed and led by Englishmen , dominated these conflicts at the expense of the Choctaw , Timucua , and Apalachee , the latter being somewhat more pacific in nature than the Creek and Chickasaw . 
 = = = New England and Acadia = = = 
 Throughout the war , New France and the Wabanaki Confederacy were able to thwart New England expansion into Acadia , whose border New France defined as the Kennebec River in southern Maine . In 1703 , Michel <unk> de la Vallière de Beaubassin , who commanded a few French Canadians and 500 of the natives in the Wabanaki Confederacy , led attacks against New England settlements from Wells to Falmouth ( present @-@ day Portland , Maine ) in the Northeast Coast Campaign . They killed or took prisoner more than 300 settlers . 
 In February 1704 , Jean @-@ Baptiste Hertel de Rouville led 250 Abenaki and Caughnawaga Indians and 50 French Canadians in a raid on Deerfield in the Province of Massachusetts Bay , and destroyed the settlement , killing and capturing many colonists . More than 100 captives were taken on an overland journey hundreds of miles north to the Caughnawaga mission village near Montreal , where most of the children who survived were adopted by the Mohawk people . Several adults were later redeemed or released in negotiated prisoner exchanges , including the minister , who tried for years without success to ransom his daughter . She became fully assimilated , marrying a Mohawk man . There was an active market in colonists during these years , and communities raised funds to ransom their citizens from Native American captivity . 
 Unable to effectively combat these raids , New England colonists retaliated by launching an expedition against Acadia . Led by the famous Native American fighter Benjamin Church , the expedition raided Grand Pré , Chignecto , and other settlements . Although French accounts claim that Church attempted an attack on Acadia 's capital , Port Royal , Church 's account of the expedition describes a war council in which the expedition decided against making an attack . 
 Father Sébastien Rale was widely suspected of inciting the Norridgewock tribe against the New Englanders . Massachusetts Governor Joseph Dudley put a price on his head . In the winter of 1705 , 275 British soldiers under the command of Colonel Winthrop Hilton were dispatched to seize Rale and sack the village . Warned in time , the priest escaped into the woods with his papers , but the militia burned the village and church . 
 French and Wabanaki Confederacy raiding activity continued in northern Massachusetts in 1705 , against which the English colonists were unable to mount an effective defense . The raids happened too quickly for defensive forces to organize , and reprisal raids usually found tribal camps and settlements empty . There was a lull in the raiding while the French and English leaders negotiated — with only limited success — the exchange of prisoners . Raids by Indians , sometimes with French participation , persisted until the end of the war . 
 In May 1707 , Governor Dudley organized an expedition to take Port Royal . Led by John March , 1 @,@ 600 men failed to take the fort by siege ; a follow @-@ up expedition in August was also repulsed . In response , the French developed an ambitious plan to raid most of the New Hampshire settlements on the Piscataqua River . However , much of the Native American support needed never materialized , and the Massachusetts town of Haverhill was raided instead . In 1709 , Philippe de Rigaud Vaudreuil , governor of New France , reported that two @-@ thirds of the fields north of Boston were untended because of French and Native American raids . French @-@ Native American war parties were returning without prisoners because the New England colonists stayed in their forts and would not come out . 
 In September 1710 , 3 @,@ 600 British and colonial forces led by Francis Nicholson finally captured Port Royal after a siege of one week . This ended official French control of the peninsular portion of Acadia ( present @-@ day mainland Nova Scotia ) , although resistance continued until the end of the war . Resistance by the Wabanaki Confederation continued in the Battle of Bloody Creek ( 1711 ) and raids along the Maine frontier . The remainder of Acadia , present @-@ day eastern Maine and New Brunswick , remained disputed territory between New England and New France . 
 = = = Expeditions against New France = = = 
 The French in New France 's heartland , Canada , opposed attacking the Province of New York . They were reluctant to arouse the Iroquois , who they feared more than they did the British , and with whom they had made the Great Peace of Montreal in 1701 . New York merchants were opposed to attacking New France , because it would interrupt the lucrative Native American fur trade , much of which came through New France . Despite the efforts of Peter Schuyler , the Albany commissioner of Indians , to interest them in the war , the Iroquois maintained their neutrality throughout the conflict . 
 Francis Nicholson and Samuel Vetch , with some financial and logistical support from the queen , organized an ambitious assault against New France in 1709 . The plan involved an overland assault on Montreal via Lake Champlain and a sea @-@ based assault by naval forces against Quebec . The land expedition reached the southern end of Lake Champlain , but was called off when the promised naval support for the attack on Quebec never materialized . ( Those forces were diverted to support Portugal . ) The Iroquois had made vague promises of support for this effort , but successfully delayed sending support until it seemed clear the expedition was going to fail . After this failure , Nicholson and Schuyler traveled to London accompanied by King Hendrick and other sachems to arouse interest in the North American frontier war . The Indian delegation caused a sensation in London , and Queen Anne granted them an audience . Nicholson and Schuyler were successful in their endeavour — the queen gave support for Nicholson 's successful capture of Port Royal in 1710 . With that success under his belt , Nicholson again returned to England , and gained support for a renewed attempt on Quebec in 1711 . 
 The plan for 1711 again called for land and sea @-@ based attacks ; its execution was a disaster . A fleet of 15 ships of the line and transports carrying 5 @,@ 000 troops led by Admiral Hovenden Walker arrived at Boston in June , doubling the town 's population and greatly straining the colony 's ability to provide necessary provisions . Sailing for Quebec at the end of July , the expedition entered the Gulf of Saint Lawrence , and a number of its ships foundered on the rocky shores near the mouth of the Saint Lawrence in the fog . More than 700 troops were lost , and Walker called the expedition off . In the meantime , Nicholson had departed for Montreal overland , but had only reached Lake George when word of Walker 's disaster reached him ; he also turned back . In this expedition , the Iroquois provided several hundred warriors to fight with the English , but they also sent warnings of the expedition to the French . 
 = = = Newfoundland = = = 
 Newfoundland 's coast was dotted with small French and English communities , with some fishing stations occupied seasonally by fishermen from Europe . Both sides had fortified their principal towns , the French at Plaisance on the western side of the Avalon Peninsula , the English at St. John 's on Conception Bay . During King William 's War , d 'Iberville had destroyed most of the English communities in 1696 – 7 ; the island again became a battleground in 1702 . In August of that year , an English fleet under the command of Commodore John Leake descended on the outlying French communities but made no attempts on Plaisance . During the winter of 1705 Daniel d 'Auger de Subercase , the French governor at Plaisance , retaliated , leading a combined French and Mi 'kmaq expedition that destroyed several English settlements and unsuccessfully besieged Fort William at St. John 's . The French and their Native American allies continued to harry the English throughout the summer , and did damages claimed at £ 188 @,@ 000 to the English establishments . The English sent a fleet in 1706 that destroyed French fishing outposts on the island 's northern coasts . In December 1708 a combined force of French , Canadian , and Mi 'kmaq volunteers captured St. John 's and destroyed the fortifications . Lacking the resources to hold the prize , they abandoned it , and St. John 's was reoccupied and refortified by the English in 1709 . ( The same French expedition also tried to take Ferryland , but it successfully resisted . ) 
 English fleet commanders contemplated , but did not make , attacks on Plaisance in 1703 and 1711 ( the latter by Admiral Walker in the aftermath of the disaster at the mouth of the St. Lawrence ) . 
 = = = Peace = = = 
 In 1712 , Britain and France declared an armistice , and a final peace agreement was signed the following year . Under terms of the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht , Britain gained Acadia ( which they renamed Nova Scotia ) , sovereignty over Newfoundland , the Hudson Bay region , and the Caribbean island of St. Kitts . France recognized British suzerainty over the Iroquois , and agreed that commerce with Native Americans further inland would be open to all nations . It retained all of the islands in the Gulf of Saint Lawrence , including Cape Breton Island , and retained fishing rights in the area , including rights to dry fish on the northern shore of Newfoundland . 
 By the later years of the war many Abenakis had tired of the conflict despite French pressures to continue raids against New England targets . The peace of Utrecht , however , had ignored Native American interests , and some Abenaki expressed willingness to negotiate a peace with the New Englanders . Governor Dudley organized a major peace conference at Portsmouth , New Hampshire ( of which he was also governor ) . In negotiations there and at Casco Bay , the Abenakis orally objected to British assertions that the French had ceded their territory ( present @-@ day eastern Maine and New Brunswick ) to Britain , and agreed to a confirmation of boundaries at the Kennebec River and the establishment of government @-@ run trading posts in their territory . The Treaty of Portsmouth , ratified on July 13 , 1713 , by eight representatives of some of the tribes of the Wabanaki Confederacy , however , included language asserting British sovereignty over their territory . Over the next year other Abenaki tribal leaders also signed the treaty , but no Mi 'kmaq ever signed it or any other treaty until 1726 . 
 = = Consequences = = 
 = = = Southern colonies = = = 
 Spanish Florida never really recovered its economy or population from the effects of the war , and was ceded to Britain following the Seven Years ' War in the 1763 Treaty of Paris . Native Americans that had been resettled along the Atlantic coast chafed under British rule , as did those allied to the British in this war . This discontent flared into the 1715 Yamasee War that posed a major threat to South Carolina 's viability . The loss of population in the Spanish territories contributed to the 1732 founding of the Province of Georgia , which was , like Carolina , granted on territory Spain had originally claimed . Following military action by James Moore against the Tuscaroras of North Carolina ( part of the Tuscarora War begun in 1711 ) , many of them fled north as refugees to join their linguistic cousins , the Iroquois . 
 The economic costs of the war were high in some of the southern English colonies , including those that saw little military activity . Virginia , Maryland , and Pennsylvania to a lesser extent , were hit hard by the cost of shipping their export products ( primarily tobacco ) to European markets , and also suffered because of several particularly bad harvests . South Carolina accumulated a significant debt burden to finance military operations . 
 = = = New England = = = 
 Although Massachusetts and New Hampshire were on the front line of the war , the New England colonies suffered less economic damage than other areas . The importance of Boston as a center of shipbuilding and trade , combined with a financial windfall caused by the crown 's military spending on the 1711 Quebec expedition , offset some of the costs of waging the war . 
 = = = Newfoundland and Acadia = = = 
 The loss of Newfoundland and Acadia restricted the French presence on the Atlantic to Cape Breton Island . French settlers from Newfoundland were resettled there , creating the colony of Île @-@ Royale , and France constructed the Fortress of Louisbourg in the following years . This presence , combined with the rights to use the Newfoundland shore , resulted in continued friction between French and British fishing interests , which was not fully resolved until late in the 18th century . The economic effects of the war were severe in Newfoundland , with the fishing fleets plying its waters significantly reduced . The British fishing fleet began to recover immediately after the peace was finalized . The British attempted to prevent Spanish ships from fishing in Newfoundland waters , as they previously had . However , many Spanish ships were simply reflagged with English straw owners to evade British controls . 
 The British capture of Acadia had long @-@ term consequences for the Acadians and Mi 'kmaq living there . Britain 's hold on Nova Scotia was initially quite tenuous , a situation that French and Mi 'kmaq resistance leaders capitalized on . British relations with the Mi 'kmaq after the war developed in the context of British expansion not just in Nova Scotia , but also along the Maine coast , where New Englanders began moving into Abenaki lands , often in violation of previous treaties . Since neither the Abenakis nor the Mi 'kmaq were recognized in the Treaty of Utrecht and the 1713 Portsmouth treaty was interpreted differently by them than by the New England signatories , the Mi 'kmaq and Abenakis resisted these incursions into their lands . This conflict , abetted by French intriguers like Sébastien Rale , developed into Father Rale 's War ( 1722 – 1727 ) . 
 British relations with the nominally conquered Acadians were also difficult . Repeated British demands that Acadians swear oaths to the British crown were resisted , and eventually sparked an exodus by the Acadians to Île @-@ Royale and Île @-@ Saint @-@ Jean ( present @-@ day Prince Edward Island ) . By the 1740s French leaders like Father Jean @-@ Louis Le Loutre orchestrated a guerrilla war with their Mi 'kmaq allies against British attempts to expand Protestant settlements in peninsular Nova Scotia . 
 Friction also persisted between France and Britain over Acadia 's borders . The boundaries laid out by the treaty were unclear , which even the French had never really formally described . France insisted that only the Acadian peninsula ( modern Nova Scotia except Cape Breton Island ) was included in the treaty , and that they retained the rights to modern New Brunswick . The disputes over Acadia , which flared into open conflict during King George 's War in the 1740s , would not be resolved until the British conquest of all French North American territories in the area in the Seven Years ' War . 
 = = = Trade = = = 
 The French did not fully comply with the commerce provisions of the Treaty of Utrecht . They attempted to prevent English trade with remote Native American tribes , and erected Fort Niagara in Iroquois territory . French settlements on the Gulf Coast continued to grow , with the settlement of New Orleans in 1718 , and other attempts , ultimately unsuccessful , to expand into Spanish @-@ controlled Texas and Florida . French trading networks penetrated the continent along the waterways feeding the Gulf of Mexico , renewing conflicts with both the British and the Spanish . Trading networks established in the Mississippi River watershed , including the Ohio River valley , also brought the French into more contact with British trading networks and colonial settlements that crossed the Appalachian Mountains . Conflicting claims over that territory eventually led to war in 1754 , when the French and Indian War broke out .

 A large petroleum reservoir was discovered just west of the city of Burkburnett , a small town in Wichita County , Texas in 1912 . Burkburnett and its surrounding communities became boomtowns , experiencing explosive growth of their populations and economies . By 1918 , an estimated 20 @,@ 000 new settlers had taken up residence around the lucrative oil field , and many Wichita County residents became wealthy virtually overnight . As people streamed into the local communities in search of high @-@ paying jobs , the nearby city of Wichita Falls began to grow in importance . Though it initially lacked the necessary infrastructure for this sudden increase in economic and industrial activity , Wichita Falls was a natural choice to serve as the local logistical hub , being the seat of Wichita County . Because office space was lacking , major stock transactions and mineral rights deals were conducted on street corners and in tents that served as makeshift headquarters for the new oil companies .

 The Newby @-@ McMahon Building is a four @-@ story brick building located near the railroad depot in downtown Wichita Falls , built in 1906 by Augustus Newby ( 1855 – 1909 ) , a director of the Wichita Falls and Oklahoma City Railway Company . The oil @-@ rig construction firm of J.D. McMahon , a petroleum <unk> and structural engineer from Philadelphia , was one of seven tenants whose offices were based in the original Newby Building . 
 According to local legend , when McMahon announced in 1919 that he would build a highrise annex to the Newby Building as a solution to the newly wealthy city 's urgent need for office space , investors were eager to invest in the project . McMahon collected $ 200 @,@ 000 ( US $ 2 @,@ 730 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) in investment capital from this group of naive investors , promising to construct a highrise office building across the street from the St. James Hotel . 
 The key to McMahon 's swindle , and his successful defense in the ensuing lawsuit , was that he never verbally stated that the actual height of the building would be 480 feet ( 150 m ) . The proposed skyscraper depicted in the blueprints that he distributed ( and which were approved by the investors ) was clearly labeled as consisting of four floors and 480 inches ( 12 m ) . 
 = = Construction and ensuing legal battle = = 
 McMahon used his own construction crews to build the McMahon Building on the small , unused piece of property next to the Newby Building , without obtaining prior consent from the owner of the property , who lived in Oklahoma . As the building began to take shape , the investors realized they had been swindled into purchasing a four @-@ story edifice that was only 40 ft ( 12 m ) tall , rather than the 480 ft ( 150 m ) structure they were expecting . 
 They brought a lawsuit against McMahon but , to their dismay , the real estate and construction deal was declared legally binding by a local judge – as McMahon had built exactly according to the blueprints they had approved , there was to be no legal remedy for the deceived investors . They did recover a small portion of their investment from the elevator company , which refused to honor the contract after they learned of the confidence trick . There was no stairway installed in the building upon its initial completion , as none was included in the original blueprints . Rather , a ladder was employed to gain access to the upper three floors . By the time construction was complete , McMahon had left Wichita Falls and perhaps even Texas , taking with him the balance of the investors ' money .

 Upon its completion and opening in 1919 , the Newby @-@ McMahon Building was an immediate source of great embarrassment to the city and its residents . The ground floor had six desks representing the six different companies that occupied the building as its original tenants . Throughout most of the 1920s , the building housed only two firms . During the 1920s , the Newby @-@ McMahon Building was featured in Robert Ripley 's Ripley 's Believe It or Not ! syndicated column as " the world 's littlest skyscraper " , which is a name that has stuck with it ever since . 
 The oil industry would ultimately prove to be a resource curse to Wichita Falls , and the Texas Oil Boom ended only a few years later . The building was vacated , boarded up , and virtually forgotten in 1929 as the Great Depression struck North Texas and office space became relatively inexpensive to lease or purchase . A fire gutted the building in 1931 , rendering it unusable for a number of years . 
 After the Great Depression , the building housed a succession of tenants , including barber shops and cafés . The building changed hands many times and was scheduled for demolition on several occasions , but escaped this fate apparently because a sufficient number of local residents came to its defense . It was eventually deeded to the city of Wichita Falls . As the building continued to deteriorate , in 1986 the city gave the building to the Wichita County Heritage Society ( WCHS ) , with the hope that it would eventually be restored , making it a viable part of the Depot Square Historic District .

 By 1999 , the Newby @-@ McMahon Building had proved to be an excessive burden on the limited capital reserves of the WCHS . The following year , the city council hired the local architectural firm of Bundy , Young , Sims & Potter to stabilize the crumbling structure , amid steadily growing talk of demolishing the building . Dick Bundy and his partners became fascinated with the history and legacy of the building ; they arranged a partnership with Marvin Groves Electric , another local business , to purchase the building . In December 2000 , the city council voted to allow the WCHS to sell the building to Marvin Groves for $ 3 @,@ 748 . 
 On June 11 , 2003 , a storm swept through Wichita Falls , bringing gusts of wind as strong as 97 mph ( 156 km / h ) . A 15 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 6 @-@ metre ) section of brick wall from the McMahon Building complex was knocked down . The damage from this storm was repaired , but full restoration of the building and the adjacent Newby Building was delayed until late 2005 . In June of that year , the City Council granted $ 25 @,@ 000 in funds from the city 's Tax Increment Financing Fund , to be invested in the restoration of the McMahon Building . Restoration of the building is estimated to have cost more than $ 254 @,@ 000 , the remainder of which was paid by the owners ( Bundy , Young , Sims & Potter , Inc. and Marvin Groves Electric ) .

It has survived tornadoes , a fire , and decades of neglect to stand as a monument to the greed , genius , graft , and gullibility of the oil boom days of North Texas . The building is currently part of the Depot Square Historic District of Wichita Falls , which has been declared a Texas Historic Landmark and listed on the National Register of Historic Places . The building has never met the criteria for the definition of a skyscraper , nor even that of a " highrise " building . Aside from serving as a local tourist attraction , the building is home to an antiques dealership , The Antique Wood , which opened in 2006 on the ground floor . The third floor has been converted into an artist 's studio . 
 The Newby @-@ McMahon Building is among several historic buildings featured in the documentary film Wichita Falls : The Future of Our Past , a retrospective analysis of the city 's architectural past produced in 2006 by Barry Levy , a public information officer with the city of Wichita Falls .

 Speed 2 : Cruise Control , the action thriller sequel to 1994 's Speed starring Sandra Bullock , Jason Patric and Willem Dafoe , was released in 1997 . The film is set on a cruise ship in the Caribbean ; to complement its setting , the soundtrack primarily features reggae music . Speed 2 director @-@ producer Jan de Bont wanted musicians to appear in the film as the ship 's live entertainment . Four songs heard in Speed 2 were performed by the musicians appearing in the film , three of which were featured on the soundtrack album . 
 British reggae band UB40 perform " Can 't Help Falling in Love " and " Tell Me Is It True " . The former is a cover of an Elvis Presley song recorded by UB40 for the soundtrack to Sliver ( 1993 ) and released on their album , Promises and Lies ( 1993 ) . " Tell Me Is It True " was first released on the Speed 2 soundtrack album and was later featured on UB40 's studio album , Guns in the Ghetto ( released ten days after the soundtrack album ) . The band was featured in the film after the filmmakers heard a demo of " Tell Me Is It True " , and wrote a cameo appearance for them into the script . 
 Brazilian singer Carlinhos Brown was also featured in the film , performing " A <unk> " ( from his 1997 album , <unk> ) . De Bont chose Brown because he wanted music that was " lively " , and thought Brown 's music was " very physical " and " full of energy " . 
 While UB40 and Brown appeared in the film as themselves , De Bont also wanted to feature a musician as one of the characters who gets trapped on the ship . He selected Canadian rhythm and blues ( R & B ) singer Tamia because he wanted someone who could sing and act . Tamia did not plan on acting in a film so early in her career , but said the part was " too perfect for [ her ] to resist " . She worked with de Bont and Quincy Jones to choose a song for the film ; they decided on " Make Tonight Beautiful " , written by Diane Warren .

 Jamaican musician Shaggy wanted to include his cover of the Erma Franklin song " Piece of My Heart " , but was unable because it was to be used in the soundtrack for an upcoming biographical film about Janis Joplin . He instead used his original song , " My Dream " ; both tracks were later featured on Shaggy 's next album Midnite Lover , released in August 1997 . 
 American reggae band Common Sense featured their song , " Never Give Up " , from their debut album Psychedelic Surf Groove ( 1996 ) . When they appeared on the soundtrack , they did not have a recording contract with a major record label ; lead singer Jai <unk> said in June 1997 that the band had begun negotiations with the soundtrack 's label , Virgin Records . ; Virgin re @-@ released Psychedelic Surf Groove later that year , and signed a contract with the band in 1998 . 
 Jamaican reggae musician Jimmy Cliff contributed to the soundtrack with a re @-@ recording of " You Can Get It If You Really Want " from The Harder They Come ( 1972 ) ; Barbadian reggae singer <unk> featured his song , " Some People " , before its release on his album Hear Me Cry , released in June 1997 . 
 British reggae singer Maxi Priest was featured on the soundtrack after recording " It Starts in the Heart " for the soundtrack to Jungle 2 Jungle ( 1997 ) . For the Speed 2 soundtrack he was asked cover a song in his characteristic style , and recorded a cover of " The Tide Is High " . Priest said his work for Jungle 2 Jungle was " more satisfying " than for Speed 2 because " It Starts in the Heart " was an original song . 
 The soundtrack also includes a reggae cover of The Police 's " Every Breath You Take " by Betty Wright , which was later released on the Police reggae @-@ tribute album <unk> <unk> in July 1997 . According to the San Jose Mercury News , Jamaican singer Diana King was scheduled to have a song on the soundtrack but her music was " judged too plodding " for the film . 
 In addition to " Make Tonight Beautiful " , other non @-@ reggae songs include a modern rock cover of Carole King 's " I Feel the Earth Move " by Leah <unk> and the R & B song " Crazy " by British singer Mark Morrison . The version of " Crazy " selected for the soundtrack was a remix by the song 's producer , Phil Chill , taken from the 12 @-@ inch single released in 1995 . 
 Composer Mark Mancina , who scored Speed 2 , wrote a techno instrumental based on the score . The track was entitled " Speed TK Re @-@ mix " , and was performed by Japanese musician Tetsuya " TK " Komuro with non @-@ lexical vocals by Lynn Mabry . The instrumental was TK 's debut in the United States , and was originally entitled " Speed 2 Theme " . " Speed TK Re @-@ mix " played during the film 's ending credits , but Mancina hoped it would be featured in the film .

 The Speed 2 : Cruise Control soundtrack , produced by Budd Carr , was released on May 20 , 1997 ( nearly a month before the film 's June 13 release ) by Virgin Records . The TK Party Mix of " Speed TK Re @-@ mix " was included on the Japanese release as a bonus track . Virgin Music Group executive vice president Nancy Berry said that when compiling the album , a decision was made not only to match the music in the film but to " create an album of summer music " and " a reggae compilation that would stand on its own " . Two songs from the film are not featured on the album : " Can 't Help Falling in Love " and " O mio babbino caro " by Victoria de los Ángeles . The album charted in Austria in August 1997 , peaking at number 40 . 
 To promote the soundtrack album , clips of each song were streamed on the film 's official website and five tracks were sent to radio stations . The first single , " Tell Me Is It True " , was released in late April 1997 and was commercially available on June 3 ; it was also the first single from Guns in the Ghetto . " My Dream " was the second single , followed by " Make Tonight Beautiful " in May and " Never Give Up " and " Speed TK Re @-@ mix " in July . De Bont agreed with Virgin that Mancina 's score could not be released until six months after the soundtrack 's release , to avoid competition . The score was not released as an album until 13 years later , when it was released in a June 2010 limited edition by La @-@ La Land Records .

 Response to the soundtrack was mixed . J. D. Considine of The Baltimore Sun said the film 's Caribbean setting was a " perfect excuse " for the reggae tracks , and the album 's " most surprising moments come with its cover versions " . Jonathan Takiff of the Philadelphia Daily News awarded the album three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half of five stars for its reggae theme , which he described as a " rare [ ... ] display of soundtrack consistency " . Chuck Campbell from the Scripps @-@ Howard News Service gave the album three out of five stars , commending the " continuity " of the reggae tracks but saying that it should have featured artists more popular than UB40 and it lacked the " commercial appeal " of other soundtracks released at the time . Stephen Thomas Erlewine of Allmusic said that although none of the soundtrack 's songs are " standouts " , it is a " fairly enjoyable collection of pop @-@ reggae Latin @-@ dance " music . 
 <unk> <unk> of the South China Morning Post was more critical of the soundtrack , calling it " surprisingly bland " and saying that " tracks that should be catchy [ ... ] are surprisingly weak " ; however , she praised TK 's remix and Maxi Priest 's cover of " The Tide Is High " . David Browne of Entertainment Weekly graded the album " D " , criticizing the " waterlogged " selection of artists and TK 's remix but saying the reggae collection was a " [ g ] ood idea " given the film 's setting . CMJ New Music Monthly said the soundtrack 's cover versions were unnecessary , contributing to " one of the scariest trends in soundtracks over the last few years " . At the 18th Golden Raspberry Awards in 1998 , " My Dream " was nominated for Worst Song but lost to " the entire song score " from The Postman ( 1997 ) . " Speed TK Re @-@ mix " became popular in Japan ; it was used as entrance music for wrestler <unk> Sakuraba , and was re @-@ released as a single in 2001 by popular demand .
