 While waiting at <unk> to embark for Egypt , the brigade conducted regimental and brigade training programmes during which all ranks and animals were inspected , and those found unfit for service were returned to their regimental depots . Between 27 and 29 October the brigade moved to Bombay for embarkation ; six transport ships carrying most of the brigade sailed on 1 November , while a seventh ship carrying two squadrons of Mysore Lancers remained behind with mechanical problems and finally set sail a fortnight later . The main body of the brigade arrived at Suez on 16 November , travelled by train to Ismailia two days later and started their first war @-@ time patrols along the banks of the Sweet Water Canal . The brigade was not assigned to a higher formation at this time but were Army Troops under command of General Headquarters . The Bikaner Camel Corps , another Imperial Service unit , was attached to the brigade at Ismailia for administrative purposes , but was not operationally attached . To expand the area the brigade could patrol , squadrons were detached to El <unk> , Kantarah and the Ferry Post crossing at Ismailia . At the same time , the brigade became responsible for patrolling the length of the Suez Canal . The other British forces defending the canal were more static infantry formations , comprising the 42nd ( East Lancashire ) , and the 10th and 11th Indian Divisions , the latter included the Imperial Service Infantry Brigade as one of its three brigades . Their Turkish opponents had around 25 @,@ 000 men in the region , including the 25th Division .

 By the end of 1914 , no contact had been made with any Turkish forces . In January 1915 the brigade was informed that a large Turkish force had moved into the Sinai . The out @-@ stations were reinforced and the squadron at Kantarah was involved in a small action at Bir El Dueidar , between Kantarah and Katia which was the brigade 's first involvement in combat . Towards the end of the month , several small battles occurred until the night of 2 / 3 February , when their Turkish opponents tried to cross the canal in force . The attempt failed and on 4 February the brigade moved into the Sinai with infantry in support . About seven miles ( 11 km ) east of <unk> they located the Turkish forces , estimated to be between three or four brigades in strength , and captured twenty @-@ five men and ninety camels . By 10 February the Turkish had withdrawn to the east and the canal was no longer in immediate danger , so the brigade returned to the canal and resumed their normal patrolling routine . At the end of February 1915 the Mysore and <unk> Lancers were ordered to return to the Sinai and destroy the water sources used by the Turkish during their advance . 
 The brigade 's next action was on 22 March when two squadrons of Hyderabad Lancers were included in a force sent to assault a Turkish formation of 800 infantry and 200 cavalry supported by artillery , entrenched ten miles ( 16 km ) east of El <unk> . After a short fight the Turkish withdrew ; it had been intended that the Lancers would move to cut off their retreat but the soft terrain prevented them getting into position in time . On 7 April , patrols from Kantara reported a force of about 1 @,@ 200 men had opened fire on them . To counter this new threat to the canal , the whole brigade was moved to Kantarah and the next day advanced into the Sinai , but failed to locate any Turkish troops and returned to Ismailia . 
 On 28 April a patrol from the Bikaner Camel Corps was attacked by an estimated 400 men with artillery support . In response the brigade crossed the canal that night supported by infantry and Egyptian artillery and advanced on El <unk> , where the Turkish were believed to be located . By daybreak however their guide reported he was lost , so the brigade continued alone . Bypassing El <unk> , they made for Bir <unk> , arriving at midday they discovered the Turkish were withdrawing to the north . Setting off in pursuit they caught up with the Turkish rearguard , which was forced to stop and fight . For the loss of two killed and eight wounded the brigade killed twenty Turkish soldiers and captured thirteen . At 20 : 00 on 29 April , the pursuit was called off and the brigade returned to Ferry Post on the canal . Several times in the following months the brigade responded to reports of Turkish incursions , but nothing came of them until 23 November when a Mysore Lancers squadron located a Turkish camel force of about sixty men fifteen miles ( 24 km ) east of Kantarah . Pursued by the Lancers , the Turkish withdrew , during which the Lancers killed seven men , captured twelve and wounded several more . Among the dead was the Bedouin leader <unk> Salim who had led most of the Turkish raids on the canal , and with his death the attacks ceased .

 From January 1916 , all patrolling east of the Suez Canal was left to the British yeomanry and the Australian Light Horse formations . The Imperial Service Cavalry Brigade concentrated on patrolling the Sweet Water Canal , the railway line between Suez and Port Said , and the Suez Canal Zone to the west of the canal , which was a restricted area for non @-@ military personnel . On 31 March , Major @-@ General W.A. Watson assumed command of the Nile Delta region and was replaced as brigade commander by Brigadier @-@ General M.H. Henderson . In May 1916 , the brigade was reduced to two cavalry regiments when the Patiala Lancers left for Mesopotamia . The brigade also carried out weapons and signal training , but the year ended without them being involved in any contact with the Turkish . 
 In February 1917 , the brigade was ordered to relieve the British 6th Mounted Brigade on the east bank of the Suez canal . The Mysore Lancers moved to Gebel @-@ <unk> , the Hyderabad Lancers to Ayun Musa , with the brigade headquarters at El Shatt . For the next few weeks the brigade sent patrols out into the Sinai until 14 April , when they were ordered to relocate to Kantarah , where two days later Brigadier @-@ General Cyril Rodney Harbord took over command . To help counter an expected Turkish attack in early May , the brigade was ordered to Khan Yunis in Gaza . The brigade marched the 150 miles ( 240 km ) in nine days , arrived on the 25 April and came under command of the Imperial Mounted Division . The division was the army reserve under orders to counter @-@ attack the Turkish left flank . The expected attack never came , but instead of moving back to the canal , the brigade became lines of communication troops , based at Khan Yunis and Rafah . For the next three months , the brigade was deployed on rear area security and patrolling duties . In May 1917 , the cavalry regiments received the Vickers machine @-@ gun to replace their older Maxim Guns and all ranks were put through training courses on the Vickers and a newer version of the Lee – Enfield Rifle , which had also just been issued . In September , the cavalry regiments ' pack horses started to be replaced by horse @-@ drawn wagons and each of the regiments was issued with twelve Hotchkiss machine @-@ guns ; one per troop . 
 = = = = Third battle of Gaza = = = = 
 On 27 September , the brigade was once again moved to the front line and given responsibility for patrolling the area between the Desert Mounted Corps and the XXI Corps , taking under command the XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment on 20 October . At the time the brigade was the only mounted formation not under the direct command of the Desert Mounted Corps , remaining Army Troops . The next British attack was the capture of Gaza in November 1917 ; the plan was for the infantry to capture their initial objectives , then the brigade would be released to advance along the Mediterranean coastline , turn right and attack the Turkish rear and their headquarters at <unk> . When the battle started , the British infantry captured all but one of their objectives , but as the brigade started to move out , a Turkish counter @-@ attack regained their previous positions , so the brigade 's advance was called off . However , by the night of 6 / 7 November , continued British attacks forced the Turkish to withdraw from Gaza and the brigade was ordered forward to pursue them . By 13 : 00 the brigade was north of Gaza when the Mysore Lancers ' leading squadron located the Turkish rearguard , which included a heavy machine @-@ gun position . At 15 : 00 the Hyderabad Lancers and the XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment attacked Beit Hanun , while the rest of the brigade attacked Beit Lahi . As the Hyderabad Lancers approached their objective , they came under a heavy artillery bombardment . Leaving one squadron and their machine @-@ guns behind to provide fire support , the rest of the Lancers attacked , capturing the Wadi <unk> line . The Lancers , still under artillery fire , held out until 16 : 30 , when they were ordered to withdraw and rejoin the rest of the brigade now concentrated at Beit Lahi . 
 The brigade now came under command of XXI Corps and at 01 : 45 on 8 November was ordered to move west of Beit Hanun and link up with the Australian Mounted Division , which was advancing from the east . As they moved to the east of Beit Hanun , the XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment , which was still attached to the brigade , came under heavy machine @-@ gun and artillery fire , preventing the brigade from advancing further . The Turkish bombardment continued until 12 : 20 , when they were observed withdrawing . The XXI Corps Cavalry Regiment and Mysore Lancers were ordered to encircle and cut off their retreat , however dug in Turkish positions at the Wadi Hesi once again halted the brigade advance . At 15 : 00 that day the brigade eventually made contact with the 4th Light Horse Brigade , completing the link up with the Australian Mounted Division . 
 The morning of 9 November was spent trying to water the horses , some of which had had no water for over twenty @-@ four hours , so the brigade did not move after the now retreating Turkish until after 11 : 20 . Moving at their best speed , the brigade reached the high ground east of El <unk> by 14 : 30 , capturing two artillery guns , rifles and ammunition on route . Two troops were sent forward to locate the Turkish rearguard , which they found at 16 : 30 crossing the plain at El Tine . Early the next morning , patrols were again sent to locate the Turkish forces but at 07 : 00 , the brigade was unexpectedly ordered back to Gaza . Despite the heavy fire the brigade had been subjected to , their casualties during the battle were light ; only four officers and ten other ranks had been wounded , sixteen horses killed and another fifty wounded . The Turkish casualties were estimated at 100 dead ; forty @-@ nine were taken prisoner and five artillery guns were captured . 
 = = = 1918 = = = 
 In early January , the brigade trained and re @-@ equipped , which included the first issue of bayonets to the Lancers . On 2 April , the Hyderabad Lancers were detached from the brigade , coming under the command of the ANZAC Mounted Division , then the Desert Mounted Corps and finally the 60th Division . The rest of the brigade moved to the Jordan Valley , arriving at Jericho on 29 April . The next day the brigade was designated the Desert Mounted Corps reserve and concentrated two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) to the west of the Ghoraniyeh bridgehead over the River Jordan . On the final day of the raid on Es Salt , on 4 May , the brigade , with the New Zealand Wellington Mounted Rifles Regiment attached , was ordered to cross the Jordan and form a defensive screen on the east bank to cover the withdrawal of the ANZAC Division . They remained in place until 5 May , when the ANZAC Division reached and crossed the Jordan safely at 16 : 00 . The brigade , less some patrols , was back within the bridgehead by 18 : 00 . In the following twelve days , the brigade patrolled to the east of the River Jordan , resulting in numerous contacts with the Turkish defenders , during which several prisoners and deserters were captured . On 11 May , the Jodhpur Lancers were assigned to the brigade and the Wellington Mounted Rifles returned to the command of their parent New Zealand Mounted Rifles Brigade . On 23 May , the brigade came under command of the Australian Mounted Division and moved to a position four miles ( 6 @.@ 4 km ) north of Jericho , remaining with the Australians until 4 June , when they left for Ras <unk> , becoming part of the newly raised 2nd Mounted Division . For almost a month the brigade was involved in training and staff exercises , during which time the brigade machine @-@ gun squadron was formed . On 5 July , the brigade left for the Jordan Valley to resume their place in the front line . 
 On 14 July , the brigade 's squadrons were involved in several small battles in the Hajlah , <unk> and Abu Tellul bridgehead area , which included a charge by the Jodhpur Lancers on the Turkish positions followed by a separate charge by a squadron of Mysore Lancers on those retreating from the Jodhpur 's action . <unk> , the day 's fighting resulted in over 100 Turkish dead and seventy prisoners taken , twenty of them wounded , from the 9th and 11th Cavalry Regiments . The brigade 's casualties were twenty @-@ five dead , seven wounded and six missing . For their part in the battles the Jodhpur Lancers were mentioned in army despatches . On 24 July , the 2nd Mounted Division was renamed 5th Cavalry Division and the brigade became the 15th ( Imperial Service ) Cavalry Brigade . In early August , the brigade carried out several patrols , crossing the bridgehead and into the Jordan Valley until 4 August , the Turkish were found to have withdrawn overnight . A small Turkish force returned on 15 August but withdrew before the brigade could move up and engage them . The brigade remained in the area until the night of the 17 / 18 August , when they were relieved by the 10th Cavalry Brigade from the 4th Cavalry Division . 
 = = = = Haifa = = = = 
 The next three weeks were taken up with regimental and brigade training , until 17 September when the brigade started returning to the front line . The Hyderabad Lancers were detached from the brigade on 22 September to escort 12 @,@ 000 prisoners to Kerkur , and on 23 September , B Battery , Honourable Artillery Company was attached to the brigade for the forthcoming operations . At 03 : 00 on 23 September , the brigade leading the 5th Cavalry Division left Afule for Haifa and Acre . The advance was unopposed until 10 : 00 that day when the Mysore Lancers reached the village of <unk> Esh Sheikh where the leading squadron was shelled from Mount Carmel and came under small @-@ arms fire from the region of the village . The Turkish had four artillery guns on the heights overlooking the brigade 's line of approach and another six to the east of Haifa , supported by machine @-@ gun posts and infantry to the west of the main Haifa road . 
 The brigade deployed its forces , with one squadron from the Mysore Lancers supported by two machine @-@ guns to capture Mount Carmel . A second Mysore squadron would cover the main road while the remainder of the regiment with two machine @-@ guns would advance along the Acre railway line . The Jodhpur Lancers would deploy in the open and wait further orders , while brigade headquarters and the remainder of the machine @-@ gun squadron and the artillery battery would be to the north of <unk> Esh Sheikh . When in position , the Jodhpur Lancers – supported by covering fire from the artillery – and the Mysore Lancers would charge the guns . At 11 : 45 the Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry caught up with the brigade and one squadron was detached to support the Mysore Lancers on Mount Carmel . The attack was scheduled to start at 14 : 00 but before that , the artillery battery and reconnaissance patrols sent out to look for the Turkish positions kept up suppressing fire on them , to which the Turkish responded with counter @-@ battery fire . The attack commenced on time ; the Jodhpur Lancers advanced in squadron columns in the face of heavy Turkish rifle and machine @-@ gun fire . 
 The Lancers charged towards the railway line , but the terrain forced them to move to their left into a wadi , which was impassable and forced the Lancers even further left . The leading squadron crossed the railway line , captured the machine @-@ gun positions and cleared the way for the remainder of the regiment to charge into the town . At the same time the regiment 's second squadron had moved right , capturing three artillery guns and two machine @-@ guns , while the two remaining squadrons charged through the town virtually unopposed , facing only sporadic rifle fire . As they reached the other side of the town they were soon joined by the two other squadrons which had made their way around the outskirts , capturing another two artillery guns en route . Elsewhere , one of the Mysore Lancers squadrons that had been giving covering fire came under heavy artillery and machine @-@ gun fire from the mouth of the River Nahr el <unk> . The squadron mounted and charged the Turkish positions , capturing two artillery guns , two machine @-@ guns and 110 prisoners . With the town secure the Mysore squadron on Mount Carmel charged a Turkish position at <unk> , capturing a 6 @-@ inch naval gun , two mountain artillery guns , two machine @-@ guns and seventy @-@ eight prisoners . During the charge they were joined by a squadron from the Sherwood Rangers Yeomanry , who captured another fifty prisoners . Prisoners taken inside the town were two German officers , twenty @-@ three Turkish officers and 664 other ranks . Two 6 @-@ inch naval guns , four 4 @.@ 2 @-@ inch guns , six 77 mm guns , four 10 @-@ pound camel guns , ten machine @-@ guns and a large quantity of ammunition were captured in Haifa . The brigade 's own casualties were relatively light ; one Indian officer and two other ranks were killed , and six Indian officers and twenty @-@ eight other ranks were wounded . Sixty horses were killed and eighty @-@ three were wounded .

 The brigade rested for the next two days and was rejoined by the Hyderabad Lancers on 25 September . At 05 : 00 the next day they resumed the advance , arriving at Lake Tiberias ( Sea of Galilee ) at 11 : 00 on 27 September . After watering the horses the brigade advanced again , reaching Kasr <unk> at 22 : 30 , where they halted for the night . They were to start again early the next day , but had to wait as the Australian Mounted Division to their right had been stopped by the Turkish forces and at 11 : 00 the brigade resumed their advance . Because of the delay , they did not reach El Kuneitra until midnight on 28 / 29 September . The next day the brigade was designated as the Desert Mounted Corps reserve , responsible for guarding their own and the Australian Mounted Division 's transport columns . During the day , the two divisions were held up for fourteen hours by a small , well @-@ placed Turkish detachment . On 30 September the brigade was ordered to head for Kiswe to round up Turkish stragglers from the Ottoman Fourth Army . By 09 : 30 on 1 October , the brigade was two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) to the north of Kiswe but were then ordered to move to a new position two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) east of Damascus , where they were to be the division reserve , while the 14th Cavalry Brigade was made responsible for the capture of Kiswe . 
 The next day , 2 October , was the day that British Empire forces officially entered Damascus . This was marked by a short period of rest for the British forces and the brigade advance did not resume until 05 : 30 on 5 October . Their first objective was Khan <unk> then <unk> which they reached unopposed on 6 October . The next day Lieutenant @-@ Colonel Hyla Holden , a SSO with the Jodhpur Lancers , became the first Allied officer to enter Beirut , the Arab Revolt forces commanded by Sherif Hussein bin Ali arrived that same afternoon and assumed control of the local government . The brigade continued their advance capturing several villages in the following days . Tell Esh Sherif on 11 October , Baalbek on 13 October , <unk> on 14 October , El Kaa on 15 October , <unk> on 16 October and Homs was reached at midday 17 October . 
 = = = = Haritan = = = = 
 At Homs , the brigade rested for two days and on 19 October headed for Er Rastan , with orders to repair a bridge over the River Orontes , which had been destroyed by retreating Turkish forces . The next day , assisted by No. 5 Field Squadron Royal Engineers , was spent repairing the bridge , after which the brigade advanced , reaching Hama on 21 October . The brigade had expected to rest there for several days but were ordered to continue the advance to Aleppo . The brigade was preceded by seven light armoured cars , but the remainder of the division was following a day behind . On 24 October the armoured cars ' advance was stopped by Turkish defences near Khan Tuman . The Turkish held a strong defensive line on a ridge line to the south and west of Aleppo . The brigade was ordered to occupy a position on the Aleppo @-@ Alexandretta road and to clear Turkish trenches on the ridge to the west of Aleppo , but when they reached the ridge line on 26 October , the position had been evacuated . Intelligence from locals suggested that a force of 1 @,@ 000 men with two small artillery guns were heading north out of Aleppo , so the brigade set off in pursuit . At 11 : 00 , the leading two Jodhpur Lancers squadrons and a machine @-@ gun section reached a position overlooking Haritan to the north of Aleppo when they came under Turkish small arms fire . Harbord ordered an immediate brigade attack ; the Mysore Lancers would move around to the east of the ridge and charge the village , followed by the other two Jodhpur Lancer squadrons while the remainder of the brigade machine @-@ gun squadron would move onto the ridge to provide covering fire , with the two other Jodhpur squadrons . The armoured cars of No. 12 Light Armoured Motor Battery arrived at 11 : 30 and were ordered along the main road to support the attack . 
 As the attack started , the leading armoured car developed a fault and returned to their start position , due to a misunderstanding , the rest of the battery followed them , taking them out of the attack . The Mysore Lancers had also started their advance but moved further east to get into a position to charge after discovering the Turkish line was longer than expected , taking them out of range of their supporting machine @-@ guns . At 12 : 00 the Lancers charged the Turkish position , killing fifty men and capturing twenty , but without any fire support from their machine @-@ gun squadron they were unable to penetrate the Turkish defences and were forced to withdraw to the rear , dismount and keep the Turkish position under observation . The extent of the Turkish position had not been fully appreciated , and was now estimated to be held by a force of 3 @,@ 000 infantry , 400 cavalry , up to twelve artillery guns and between thirty and forty machine @-@ guns . One group of Turkish soldiers started towards the Mysore Lancers position , but halted about 800 yards ( 730 m ) short and started to dig new defensive trenches . Unable to progress against the larger force , the brigade kept the position under observation and at 21 : 00 , the Turkish were seen to be withdrawing and had completely evacuated their positions by midnight . At 23 : 15 the 14th Cavalry Brigade arrived , setting up their own observation lines , until daylight when they took over the 15th Brigade 's positions . In the day 's battle , Turkish casualties were estimated to be around 100 men , while the brigade lost four British officers , including Holden attached to the Jodhpur Lancers , one Indian officer and sixteen other ranks . Twelve officers , six of them British , and forty @-@ four other ranks were wounded , and three other ranks were reported missing . 
 That night , the Turkish forces withdrew twenty miles ( 32 km ) to Deir el <unk> to the north @-@ west of Aleppo . The 5th Cavalry Division was not strong enough by itself to continue the advance and halted , waiting for the Australian Mounted Division to catch up with them . On 27 October , the day after their unsuccessful charge , the brigade became the division reserve and was ordered back to Aleppo . Events now overtook them ; at noon on 31 October , after the Armistice of Mudros had been agreed the previous day , the war with the Ottoman Empire ended . 
 = = Disbandment = = 
 After the Armistice of Mudros , the brigade remained with 5th Cavalry Division in Palestine as part of the occupation forces . However , demobilization began immediately and the brigade was broken up by January 1920 . Although they did not suffer the same casualties associated with the Western Front in France , its units did not escape without loss . The Mysore Lancers had twenty @-@ three men killed in action , one man died as a result of his wounds , another two were reported missing believed killed , three wounded men were taken prisoner and released at the end of the war , and forty @-@ nine men were wounded . The Hyderabad Lancers had twelve men killed in action , four died as a result of their wounds , seven were reported missing believed killed and forty @-@ three were wounded . The casualties for the Jodhpur Lancers , while serving with the brigade , were seventeen men killed in action , five died as a result of their wounds , five missing believed killed , two were taken prisoner and thirty @-@ one were wounded . The casualties for the Patiala Lancers were not recorded in the brigade history , but the Commonwealth War Graves Commission records that while attached to the brigade from 1914 to May 1916 they had seven dead . For their service , several men of the brigade were given orders or were decorated ; the brigade received six Distinguished Service Orders , three Order of the Nile , one Order of the British Empire , six Order of British India , fourteen Military Crosses , two Military Medals , forty @-@ nine Indian Distinguished Service Medals , twelve Indian Order of Merits and sixty @-@ six were mentioned in despatches . 
 = = = Memorials = = = 
 The main memorial to the brigade is the Teen Murti ( three soldiers ) memorial in New Delhi , a stone and bronze sculpture inscribed with the names of those members of the brigade killed in action ( see image in the info box ) . The three statues represent soldiers from the Indian States of Hyderabad , Mysore and Jodhpur . A memorial on the site of the fighting at Haritan is inscribed with the date of the battle , the units involved and details of the casualties . The Port Tewfik Memorial was erected at the Suez Canal to commemorate the 4 @,@ 000 Indian officers and soldiers killed during the Sinai and Palestine Campaign who have no known grave . The brigade 's capture of Haifa on 23 September is remembered by the present Indian Army as Haifa Day , and the Mysore and Jodhpur Lancers part in its capture was recognised by the British government , which awarded them the battle honour Megiddo . 
 The British army commander Edmund Allenby in his despatches also commented on the contribution of the men in the brigade : 
 " I take this opportunity of expressing my appreciation of the valuable services and high soldierly qualities of the following contingents of Indian Imperial Service Troops which , through the generosity of their respective Ruling Chiefs , were placed at my disposal : — Hyderabad Lancers , Jodhpur Lancers , Kathiawar Signal Troop , Mysore Lancers .

 Route 3 is a state highway in the northern part of New Jersey in the United States . The route runs 10 @.@ 84 miles ( 17 @.@ 45 km ) from U.S. Route 46 in Clifton , Passaic County to U.S. Route 1 / 9 in North Bergen , Hudson County . Route 3 is sometimes called the Secaucus Bypass within Secaucus . The route is a divided highway for its entire length , with most of the highway considered a freeway , except the westernmost part , which contains direct access to a few businesses . Route 3 intersects many major roads , including the Garden State Parkway and Route 21 in Clifton , the western spur of the New Jersey Turnpike ( Interstate 95 ) in East Rutherford , the eastern spur of the New Jersey Turnpike in Secaucus , and Route 495 in North Bergen . A commuting route for northern New Jersey to the Lincoln Tunnel into New York City by way of Route 495 , Route 3 also provides access to the Meadowlands Sports Complex in East Rutherford . The road inspired a story in The New Yorker in 2004 by Ian Frazier . 
 Route 3 was originally established in 1927 to run from the New York border on the west shore of Greenwood Lake to Secaucus . In 1929 , the western terminus was cut back to Paterson when the alignment west of there was planned to become part of Route S4B . Route 3 originally followed present @-@ day Route 20 through Paterson and ran along local streets to East Rutherford , where it followed present @-@ day Route 120 and the Paterson Plank Road to Secaucus . It was extended east to the Lincoln Tunnel in 1939 . The freeway section of Route 3 between U.S. Route 46 in Clifton and East Rutherford was completed in the 1940s as Route S3 as well as the Secaucus Bypass , which was designated a bypass of Route 3 . Route 3 was moved to the Route S3 freeway and the Secaucus Bypass in 1953 and was truncated to U.S. Route 1 / 9 in North Bergen in 1959 when the Lincoln Tunnel approach was designated as Interstate 495 . The Route 3 freeway has seen many improvements over the years such as widening and interchange reconstructions . It is undergoing final stages of major reconstruction , which is expected to be completed in 2014 , to modern highway standards with bridge replacements , including the new Passaic River bridge that is now functional , between Clifton and Route 17 in Rutherford .

 Route 3 heads to the southeast , from an interchange with U.S. Route 46 and County Route 621 ( Valley Road ) as a six @-@ lane divided highway with a Jersey barrier . It is not up to freeway standards , as it contains a few businesses with right @-@ in / right @-@ out access . The route interchanges with County Route 623 ( Grove Street ) and County Route 509 ( Broad Street ) , then the Garden State Parkway , where it interchanges with the southbound lanes and then the northbound lanes . All interchange movements are present between Route 3 and the Garden State Parkway , except from the southbound Garden State Parkway to westbound Route 3 and from eastbound Route 3 to the northbound Garden State Parkway . 
 Past the Garden State Parkway , Route 3 eventually turns into a six @-@ lane freeway that is not designed to Interstate Highway standards . It interchanges with County Route 622 ( Bloomfield Avenue ) , then intersects County Route 603 ( Passaic Avenue ) , which heads south into Nutley to become Route 7 . The next interchange is for County Route 601 ( Main Avenue ) . Past that interchange , Route 3 comes to an interchange with Route 21 , then passes over the route . 
 = = = Bergen County = = = 
 Route 3 crosses the Passaic River on a fixed bridge , which replaced a double @-@ leaf trunnion bascule bridge in 2013 , into Rutherford , Bergen County . Just after crossing the river , the route interchanges with County Route 507 ( Riverside Avenue ) . The freeway continues through a residential area and comes to an exit that provides access to southbound Route 17 . Past this interchange , Route 3 is closely paralleled by Route 17 to the south until Route 3 interchanges again with Route 17 , which continues to the north of Route 3 . 
 The route widens to eight lanes and enters the New Jersey Meadowlands , crossing into East Rutherford and then passing over the Berrys Creek . Route 3 passes to the south of the Meadowlands Sports Complex and has access to Route 120 , MetLife Stadium , and the Meadowlands Racetrack in the eastbound direction and to MetLife Stadium and the Meadowlands Racetrack in the westbound direction . The route narrows back to six lanes and comes to a ramp which provides access to the western spur of the New Jersey Turnpike ( Interstate 95 ) . Route 3 interchanges with Route 120 and the carriageways separately . The route passes under the western spur of the New Jersey Turnpike and becomes eight lanes again . 
 = = = Hudson County = = = 
 Route 3 crosses the Hackensack River into Secaucus , Hudson County . It interchanges with the Meadowlands Parkway and continues southeast into a residential area with the carriageways joining back together . At the interchange with County Route 681 ( Paterson Plank Road ) , Route 3 widens into a local @-@ express lane configuration with three express lanes and local lanes each in the eastbound direction and two express lanes and three local lanes in the westbound direction . The route passes by the Mill Creek Mall and crosses under the mainline of the New Jersey Turnpike ( Interstate 95 ) . Route 3 comes to an eastbound exit and entrance with Harmon Meadow Boulevard and features a cloverleaf interchange with Paterson Plank Road . The route crosses the <unk> Creek into North Bergen . In North Bergen , the route comes to a truck @-@ restricted eastbound ramp for eastbound Route 495 . Route 3 then interchanges with Route 495 , which provides access to the New Jersey Turnpike and the Lincoln Tunnel . Past this interchange , the local @-@ express lane configuration ends and Route 3 heads southeast as a four @-@ lane highway . The route meets a westbound exit and entrance for the Lincoln Tunnel Park & Ride and comes to its terminus at a traffic light with U.S. Route 1 / 9 south , with no direct access from Route 3 east to U.S. Route 1 / 9 north . ( Both 1 / 9 north and 1 / 9 south do have connectors to the start of Route 3 west . ) 
 = = History = = 
 Route 3 was legislated by the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering to run from the New York border on the west shore of Greenwood Lake to Route 1 ( now U.S. Route 1 / 9 ) in Secaucus . In 1929 , the route west of Paterson was designated to become part of Route S4B , a spur of Route 4 , and Route 3 was modified to end at Route S4B north of Paterson . Route S4B was never built west of Paterson while the portion that was built became Route 208 in 1953 . 
 Following the 1929 amendments , Route 3 ran from Paterson along today 's Route 20 , through Clifton , Passaic , Wallington , Carlstadt , and East Rutherford along local streets , and finally down Paterson Plank Road ( part of which is today 's Route 120 ) to Secaucus . In 1939 , Route 3 was extended east along present @-@ day Route 495 to the Lincoln Tunnel into Manhattan , New York City . 
 The section of what is now Route 3 from U.S. Route 46 in Clifton to Route 120 in East Rutherford was planned to be built as a freeway in the mid @-@ 1930s designated as Route S3 , a spur of Route 3 . Construction started in 1940 , but it was interrupted by World War II . It would resume , with the first section of freeway opening between Route 17 to Route 3 ( now Route 120 ) in 1942 . The freeway was completed by 1949 , including a bypass of Secaucus that was designated as a bypass of Route 3 . The freeway had cost a total of $ 10 million to build and cut commuting times between Northern New Jersey and Manhattan . Before the freeway was completed , Route S3 was designated to follow Allwood Road between Hepburn Road and Bloomfield Avenue in Clifton ; the road was later returned to Passaic County and is currently County Route 602 . In 1942 , a spur of Route S3 in Clifton was commissioned ; this became Route S3 Spur in 1948 and Route 161 in 1953 . 
 In the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering , Route 3 was realigned to follow the entire length of the Route S3 freeway . In addition , Route 3 in Secaucus was shifted off the Paterson Plank Road to the newly built Secaucus Bypass . The original alignment of Route 3 became Route 153 . Only the section west of Paterson Plank Road was state @-@ maintained after the renumbering , and the entire route was eliminated by the 1990s . In the mid @-@ 1950s , Route 3 was planned as one of the original routes of the Interstate Highway System ; however , the New Jersey State Highway Department had deemed it too expensive to bring it up to Interstate Highway standards and Interstate 280 was favored instead . In 1959 , the Lincoln Tunnel approach was designated as Interstate 495 and Route 3 was truncated back to U.S. Route 1 / 9 in North Bergen . 
 Many improvements have occurred to the Route 3 freeway . In the 1970s , the interchanges with Route 17 , the New Jersey Turnpike western spur , and Route 120 were improved with the construction of the Meadowlands Sports Complex in the area . The bridge over the Berrys Creek , originally built in 1948 , was reconstructed in the mid @-@ 1990s and Route 3 was widened to eight lanes in the area near the bridge . In 2003 , the interchange with Route 495 and the intersection with U.S. Route 1 / 9 was improved at a cost of $ 16 million . 
 Plans were made to improve Route 3 near the Meadowlands Sports Complex with the construction of American Dream Meadowlands . An overpass between eastbound Route 3 and northbound Route 120 was completed in May 2009 at a cost of $ 38 @.@ 1 million , a flyover from southbound Route 120 to eastbound Route 3 was completed in early 2010 at a cost of $ 13 million , and improvements to the New Jersey Turnpike interchange was completed in the later part of 2010 at a cost of $ 49 million .

 As of 2013 , Route 3 is in the final stages of major reconstruction to modern highway standards with noise walls installed and bridge replacements , including the new Passaic River bridge that is now functional , between Main Avenue in Clifton and Route 17 in Rutherford . All work is projected to be complete in 2014 . In a separate project , the roadway is being resurfaced in 2013 from just west of the Route 17 north interchange to U.S. Route 1 / 9 in North Bergen . 
 The NJDOT is planning to rebuild the interchange at U.S. Route 46 and Valley Road in Clifton starting in 2014 . This project will reconfigure ramps , bring bridges up to standard , and will provide for three @-@ lane connections between Route 3 and U.S. Route 46 . It is projected to cost more than $ 150 million .

 Route 3 was the inspiration for a story in The New Yorker in 2004 by Ian Frazier . In this story , Frazier describes a bus journey along the route , mentioning scenes along the road such as traffic congestion , the Meadowlands Sports Complex , and the Tick Tock Diner off Route 3 in Clifton . He also described a walking journey he once took into New York City along Route 3 , encountering heavy , noisy traffic speeding by and debris along the side of the road .

 A.F.C. Sudbury is a semi @-@ professional football club from Sudbury , Suffolk , England . The club was formed in 1999 by the merger of Sudbury Town and Sudbury Wanderers , the process giving rise to the name Amalgamated Football Club Sudbury . A.F.C. Sudbury won the Eastern Counties League Premier Division five seasons in a row and reached the final of the FA Vase three years in a row , both records for the respective competitions . Their home ground is the King 's Marsh Stadium in the <unk> @-@ <unk> area of Sudbury , and their home colours are yellow and blue . The club currently play in the Premier Division of the Isthmian League . 
 = = History = = 
 A.F.C. Sudbury was formed on 1 June 1999 by the amalgamation of the town 's two previous clubs , Sudbury Town ( founded 1885 ) and Sudbury Wanderers ( founded 1958 ) . 
 In their debut season , 1999 – 2000 , Sudbury finished in third place in the Eastern Counties League Premier Division . The following five seasons all resulted in Sudbury winning the Premier Division title – a league record . Sudbury did not take promotion at any of these opportunities , despite being entitled to . In this period Sudbury had a series of good performances in national cup competitions . In 2000 – 01 the club reached the first round of the FA Cup , where they were beaten 6 – 1 by Darlington . They reached the semi @-@ final of the 2001 – 02 FA Vase , before being knocked out by Tiptree United . The following three seasons saw Sudbury reaching the final each year ( a Vase record ) , but being defeated every time , by Brigg Town in 2003 , Winchester City in 2004 and Didcot Town in 2005 . However , the club did win the Suffolk Premier Cup three times , in 2001 – 02 , 2002 – 03 and 2003 – 04 . 
 The financial constraints of owning two grounds led the board not to apply for promotion until the beginning of the 2005 – 06 season . After finishing third in 2005 – 06 , a season in which they won the Eastern Counties League Cup , and passing the necessary ground inspection Sudbury were invited to take promotion into a resurrected Isthmian League Division One North , following the re @-@ structuring of the National League System . Potential legal action from the Northern Premier League nearly scuppered this move , but Sudbury started 2006 – 07 in the new division . The management team of Gary Harvey and Michael Cheetham , who took the team up , both resigned before the season could begin , citing work and family commitments , respectively . New manager Mark <unk> was appointed in May 2006 , signed from Needham Market . Sudbury 's first season at this level saw the club finish in fifth place , qualifying them for the promotion play @-@ offs . After beating Enfield Town in the semi @-@ final , Sudbury lost to Harlow Town in a penalty shoot @-@ out . Sudbury again qualified for the play @-@ offs in 2007 – 08 , finishing second in the table , but were defeated in the semi @-@ final by eventual winners Canvey Island . In the close @-@ season manager <unk> resigned , and was replaced by his assistant Nicky Smith . 
 Sudbury were moved into the Southern League Division One Midlands for 2008 – 09 following a restructuring of the English football pyramid . After two seasons of mid @-@ table finishes the club was moved back to the Isthmian League Division One North for 2010 – 11 . Smith resigned in September 2011 and was replaced by his assistant Chris Tracey . At the start of the 2013 – 14 , Sudbury appointed <unk> manager David Batch as their new manager , after Chris Tracey left the club . Sudbury reached the final of the Isthmian League Cup in April 2014 , but lost 3 – 0 away to Maidstone United . Batch left to join St Neots Town at the end of 2014 , and was replaced by Jamie Godbold . Godbold led the club to a third @-@ place finish and qualification for the play @-@ offs , where they were defeated by Brentwood Town in the semi @-@ final . The following season Sudbury won the division with three games to spare , earning promotion to the Premier Division .

 A.F.C. Sudbury play their home games at the King 's Marsh Stadium in the <unk> @-@ <unk> area of Sudbury , previously home to Sudbury Wanderers . Between June 2010 and August 2014 , due to a sponsorship deal , the ground was officially titled The MEL Group Stadium . At the time of A.F.C. Sudbury 's formation the ground consisted of two pitches , a training area , clubhouse , floodlights , a 200 @-@ seat stand on the West side of the main pitch and covered ends behind the goals . A 300 @-@ capacity terrace ( the Shed ) was constructed on the East side of the pitch in 2000 and houses the more vocal section of the crowd . A new clubhouse , also containing a grassroots football and education centre , was completed in 2010 . The ground is fully enclosed by fencing and there are turnstiles at the main entrance . 
 A.F.C. Sudbury sold Sudbury Town 's former ground , the Priory Stadium , to a housing developer in June 2007 . The money from this sale was earmarked for paying off loans , and capital gains tax , as well as a new clubhouse and changing rooms . Planning permission for the construction of the new facilities was granted by <unk> District Council in August 2008 , though various conditions regarding issues such as possible land contamination , the site 's archaeological value , risk of flooding and drainage are required to be addressed before work may commence . 
 A 3G artificial turf pitch was installed prior to the 2015 – 16 season .

 = Cyclura nubila = 
 The Cuban rock iguana ( Cyclura nubila ) , also known as the Cuban ground iguana or Cuban iguana , is a species of lizard of the iguana family . It is the largest of the West Indian rock iguanas ( genus Cyclura ) , one of the most endangered groups of lizards . This herbivorous species with red eyes , a thick tail , and spiked jowls is one of the largest lizards in the Caribbean . 
 The Cuban iguana is distributed throughout the rocky southern coastal areas of mainland Cuba and its surrounding islets with a feral population thriving on Isla Magueyes , Puerto Rico . A subspecies is found on the Cayman Islands of Little Cayman and Cayman Brac . Females guard their nest sites and often nest in sites excavated by Cuban crocodiles . As a defense measure , the Cuban iguana often makes its home within or near prickly @-@ pear cacti . 
 Although the wild population is in decline because of predation by feral animals and habitat loss caused by human agricultural development , the numbers of iguanas have been bolstered as a result of captive @-@ breeding and other conservation programs . Cyclura nubila has been used to study evolution and animal communication , and its captive @-@ breeding program has been a model for other endangered lizards in the Caribbean . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The Cuban rock iguana 's generic name Cyclura is derived from the Ancient Greek <unk> ( κύκλος ) meaning " circular " and <unk> ( <unk> ) meaning " tail " , after the thick @-@ ringed tail characteristic of all Cyclura . John Edward Gray , the British zoologist who first described the species in 1831 as Iguana ( Cyclura ) nubila or " Clouded Guana " , gave it the specific name nubila , Latin for " cloudy " . 
 The closest relatives of Cyclura nubila are the Grand Cayman blue iguana ( Cyclura lewisi ) and the Northern Bahamian rock iguana ( Cyclura <unk> ) ; phylogenetic analysis indicates that these three species diverged from a common ancestor three million years ago . 
 Cyclura nubila was previously considered to have three subspecies , the Grand Cayman blue iguana ( termed Cyclura nubila lewisi ) , the Lesser Caymans iguana ( Cyclura nubila caymanensis ) , and the nominate Cuban subspecies ( Cyclura nubila nubila ) . This classification was revised after later mitochondrial DNA analysis and research into the scalation patterns on the heads of Caribbean <unk> lizards ( these patterns are unique by species and act as a " fingerprint " of sorts ) . The Grand Cayman blue iguana is now recognized as a separate species . 
 = = Anatomy and morphology = = 
 The Cuban iguana is a large lizard , with an average body length of 40 centimeters ( 16 in ) from snout to vent ( the base of the tail ) . On rare occasions , individual males with lengths of 1 @.@ 6 meters ( 5 @.@ 2 ft ) when measured from the snout to the tip of the tail have been recorded at the wildlife sanctuary within the Guantanamo Bay Naval Base ( GTMO ) , Cuba with females being two thirds that size . The species is sexually dimorphic : males are much larger than females , and males have enlarged femoral pores on their thighs , which are used to release pheromones to attract mates and mark territory . The skin of male Cuban iguanas ranges in color from dark gray to brick red , whereas that of females is olive green with dark stripes or bands . In both sexes , limbs are black with pale brown oval spots and solid black feet . Young animals tend to be dark brown or green with faint darker striping or mottling in five to ten diagonal transverse bands on the body . These bands blend in with the body color as the iguana ages . Both sexes possess a dewlap ( skin hanging below the neck ) and a row of spines running down their back to their thick tail . Their heads and necks are short and stout , their teeth are solid and broad , and they have powerful jaw muscles . Their jowls , which grow larger as the animal ages , are covered in spiky protuberances called tubercles . 
 The Cuban iguana 's eyes have a golden iris and red sclera . Cuban iguanas have excellent vision and the ability to detect shapes and movement at long distances . Sensory cells called " double cones " give them sharp color vision and enable them to see ultraviolet wavelengths . By seeking out locations with more ultraviolet sunlight to bask in , the Cuban iguana optimizes vitamin D production . Cuban iguanas have poor low @-@ light vision , because they have few rods or photoreceptor cells . Like other iguanids , Cuban iguanas have a white photosensory organ on the top of their heads , called the parietal eye . This " eye " has only a rudimentary retina and lens and cannot form images , but it is sensitive to changes in light and can detect movement . 
 = = Diet = = 
 Like all Cyclura species , the Cuban iguana is primarily herbivorous ; 95 % of its diet consists of the leaves , flowers and fruits from as many as 30 plant species , including the seaside rock shrub ( <unk> americana ) , thistle , prickly pear ( Opuntia stricta ) , black mangrove ( Avicennia germinans ) , red mangrove ( Rhizophora mangle ) , olives , and various grasses . Aiding in the digestion of this high @-@ cellulose diet , colonies of nematodes occupy 50 % of the contents of Cuban iguanas ' large intestines . Cuban iguanas occasionally consume animal matter , and individuals have been observed scavenging the corpses of birds , fish and crabs . Researchers on Isla Magueyes observed a single episode of cannibalism in 2006 when an adult female iguana chased , caught , and ate a hatchling . The researchers wrote that the dense population on Isla Magueyes could have caused this incident . 
 Like other herbivorous lizards , the Cuban iguana is presented with a problem for osmoregulation : plant matter contains more potassium and has less nutritional content per gram than meat so more must be eaten to meet the lizard 's metabolic needs . Unlike those of mammals , reptile kidneys cannot concentrate urine to save on water intake . Instead , reptiles excrete toxic nitrogenous wastes as solid uric acid through their cloaca . In the case of the Cuban iguana , which consumes large amounts of vegetation , these excess salt ions are excreted through the salt gland in the same manner as in birds . 
 = = Mating and behavior = = 
 Cuban iguanas reach sexual maturity at an age of two to three years . Males are gregarious when immature , but become more aggressive as they age , vigorously defending territories in competition for females . Females are more tolerant of each other , except after laying their eggs . 
 Mating occurs in May and June , and females lay single clutches of three to 30 eggs in June or July . According to field research , females deposit their eggs at the same nesting sites each year . The nests are built near each other as suitable nesting sites are becoming rare . On Cuba 's Isla de la Juventud , Cuban iguanas nest in pockets of earth exposed to the sun by Cuban crocodiles , after the crocodiles ' eggs have hatched . These nests are separate from where adult iguanas live . In areas without crocodiles , the iguanas excavate nests in sandy beaches . At the San Diego Zoo , a female built a nest at the end of a long chamber she excavated in the sand . She stood near it for weeks , defending it by shaking her head and hissing at anyone who approached ; this behavior demonstrated that Cuban iguanas guard their nest sites . The hatchlings spend several days to two weeks in the nest chamber from the time they hatch to the time they emerge from the nests ; dispersing individually after emergence . 
 Although Cuban iguanas typically remain still for long periods of time and have a slow lumbering gait due to their body mass , they are capable of quick bursts of speed for short distances . Younger animals are more arboreal and will seek refuge in trees , which they can climb with great agility . The animal is a capable swimmer and will take to nearby water if threatened . When cornered they can bite and lash their tails in defense . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The Cuban iguana is naturally distributed in rocky coastal areas on Cuba and throughout as many as 4 @,@ 000 islets surrounding the Cuban mainland , including Isla de la Juventud off the southern coast , which has one of the most robust populations . Relatively safe populations are found on some islets along the north and south coasts and in isolated protected areas on the mainland . These include Guanahacabibes Biosphere Reserve in the west , <unk> del Granma National Park , <unk> Wildlife Refuge , Punta Negra @-@ <unk> Ecological Reserve , and Delta del <unk> Wildlife Refuge , all in eastern Cuba . Because of this wide distribution , accurate information about the number of distinct subpopulations of Cuban iguanas cannot be determined . The population on the US Naval Base at Guantánamo Bay has been estimated at 2 @,@ 000 to 3 @,@ 000 individuals , and the animals are treated well and protected by US forces stationed at the base . An unusual incident occurred when a detainee in the prison assaulted a guard with a bloody tail torn from a Cuban iguana in May 2005 . 
 The subspecies , Cyclura nubila caymanensis , is endemic to the " Sister Islands " of Little Cayman and Cayman Brac . The population on Cayman Brac is less than 50 of these animals and Little Cayman supports 1 @,@ 500 . A feral population of C. n. caymanensis has been established on Grand Cayman . 
 The Cuban iguana makes its burrow near cacti or thistles , sometimes even within the cactus itself . These thorny plants offer protection and their fruit and flowers offer the iguanas food . In areas without cacti , the lizards make their burrows in dead trees , hollow logs , and limestone crevices . 
 In the mid @-@ 1960s a small group of Cuban iguanas was released from a zoo on Isla Magueyes , southwest of Puerto Rico , forming an independent free @-@ ranging feral population . As of 2000 , there has been talk of removing or relocating this population of iguanas by the US Department of Interior . This feral population is the source for 90 % of the captive Cuban iguanas held in private collections and was the source for part of a study on animal communication and evolution conducted by Emilia Martins , a biologist at Indiana University . 
 Emilia Martins ' 1998 study compared the head @-@ bob displays from the source population on Cuba with these animals on Isla Magueyes . The durations and pauses were longer by as much as 350 % in the feral population . In comparison , the blue iguana of Grand Cayman 's head @-@ bob displays differed from those of the animals on Cuba by only about 20 % . The rapid change in display structure between the colony of animals on Isla Magueyes and those on Cuba illustrated the potential of small founding population size as a catalyst to evolution with regard to communication or display . In this case the difference was by only six generations at most . 
 = = Conservation = = 
 The Cuban iguana is well @-@ established in public and private collections . Many zoological parks and private individuals keep them in captive breeding programs , minimizing the demand for wild @-@ caught specimens for the pet trade . Cuban iguanas are listed as " vulnerable " on the IUCN Red List , as is the predominant Cuban subspecies , while the Cayman Island subspecies is " critically endangered " . The total population in Cuba is estimated at between 40 @,@ 000 and 60 @,@ 000 individuals , and the feral population on Isla Magueyes is estimated at over 1 @,@ 000 . According to Allison Alberts , Chief Conservation Officer of the San Diego Zoo and lead researcher in Cuba , among the many wildlife species at GTMO , " The Cuban Iguana is one of the largest , undoubtedly the most visible , and certainly the most charismatic . It seems that no one completes a tour of duty at GTMO without getting to know these prehistoric @-@ looking giants . " 
 In a round @-@ about way , the Cuban iguana 's status under the US Endangered Species Act made its way into US jurisprudence . In the fall of 2003 , attorney Tom Wilner needed to persuade the justices of the US Supreme Court to take the case of a dozen Kuwaiti detainees being held in isolation in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , without charges , without a hearing and without access to a lawyer . According to Peter <unk> , a professor of law at the University of San Francisco , Wilner unsuccessfully made two arguments before the Court to hear his case ; in his third argument he changed tactics by mentioning US law and the Cuban iguana . Wilner argued , " Anyone , including a federal official , who violates the Endangered Species Act by harming an iguana at Guantanamo , can be fined and prosecuted . Yet the government argues that US law does not apply to protect the human prisoners there " . According to <unk> , the Supreme Court agreed to hear the case because of this argument . 
 = = = Decline = = = 
 In general the species is in decline , more quickly on the mainland than on the outlying islets . The Cuban mainland populations have been declining at a rate of over 1 % per year for the last 10 years . The Cuban iguana is no longer found on the northeastern coast of Havana , the <unk> Peninsula , or Cayo Largo , areas where it was found in great numbers some 30 to 40 years ago . 
 As opposed to other West Indian islands where iguanids are found , consumption of iguana meat is not widespread in Cuba . Certain fishing communities do practice it for subsistence , but for the most part the animal is not eaten by Cubans . According to naturalist Thomas Barbour , this is based on unfounded superstitious beliefs which suggest that the iguanas emit a dark fluid reminiscent of the black vomit of yellow fever victims when they are killed . One of the reasons for their decline is habitat destruction caused by the overgrazing of farm animals , housing development , and the building of tourist resorts on the beaches where the animals prefer to build their nests . Populations of iguanas suffer by the direct predation of introduced animals such as rats , cats , and dogs . Feral hogs are responsible for destroying many iguana nest sites which they dig up for eggs . Ant predation of iguana eggs is another threat to the species . 
 = = = Recovery = = = 
 All but one of the major iguana concentrations are either partially or fully protected by the Cuban government . Although no captive @-@ breeding program exists within Cuba , the Centro Nacional de Areas <unk> ( the National Center for Protected Areas ) has suggested it will explore this route in the future . In 1985 the Cuban government issued a commemorative peso depicting a Cuban iguana on the head side of the coin in an attempt to raise awareness for this animal . 
 In 1993 the San Diego Zoo experimentally tested the utility of a " head @-@ starting " program for newly hatched Cuban iguanas with funding from the National Science Foundation 's Conservation and Restoration Biology Program . " Head @-@ starting " is a process by which the Cuban iguana 's eggs are hatched in an incubator and the animals are protected and fed for the first 20 months of their lives . The purpose is to get the animals to a size where they are more capable of fleeing from or fighting off predators . This technique was originally used to protect hatchling sea turtles , Galapagos land iguanas , and Ctenosaura bakeri on the island of Útila , but Alberts used it for the first time on a Cyclura species with the Cuban iguana . The purpose was not only to help the Cuban iguana population , but to test the overall effectiveness of <unk> as a conservation strategy for more critically endangered species of Cyclura . 
 The strategy proved successful , according to Alberts , when the released head @-@ started iguanas reacted to predators , foraged for food , and behaved like their wild @-@ born counterparts . This strategy has been implemented with great success with other critically endangered species of Cyclura and Ctenosaura throughout the West Indies and Central America , notably the Jamaican iguana , Grand Cayman blue iguana , <unk> 's iguana , Allen Cays iguana , Acklins ground iguana , and Anegada iguana . 
 = Thetford Castle = 
 Thetford Castle is a medieval motte and bailey castle in the market town of Thetford in the Breckland area of Norfolk , England . The first castle in Thetford , a probable 11th century Norman ringwork called Red Castle , was replaced in the 12th century by a much larger motte and bailey castle on the other side of the town . This new castle was largely destroyed in 1173 by Henry II , although the huge motte , the second largest man @-@ made mound in England , remained intact . The motte , recognised as a scheduled monument , now forms part of a local park , and the remains are known variously as Castle Hill , Castle Mound and Military Parade . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = 11th century = = = 
 In the 11th century the largest towns in England were concentrated in the east and south @-@ east of the country , especially in East Anglia . Thetford was an important settlement during the period and the second largest town in East Anglia . Thetford comes from " <unk> " , or " the ford " , and was a key point on the ancient Icknield Way . Thetford was also an important international trading hub and a centre of pottery production . An earth and timber fort had been built on this site during the Iron Age period but had been left to decay and by the late Saxon era the town had been protected by a burgh , or ditched enclosure , that surrounded the town . 
 The first castle on the Thetford site was Red Castle and was probably built shortly after the Norman conquest of England by William de Warenne , the Earl of Surrey . The castle was a ringwork design and was positioned across the line of the defensive Saxon ditch , in the process enclosing and cutting off the local church from the inside of the town , and building over part of the local cemetery . 
 = = = 12th century = = = 
 By 1100 , the town of Thetford was controlled by Roger Bigod , the Earl of Norfolk . Roger Bigod decided to build a new motte and bailey castle , positioning it so as to guard both the town and the local crossing of the Icknield Way over the River <unk> and the Little Ouse . 
 At the heart of the castle was a huge motte , or artificial mound , sunk into a deep surrounding ditch , and protected on the north site by two sets of complex ramparts , which were probably part of the original Iron Age fortifications of the site . At 19 @.@ 6 m ( 64 ft ) high - 22 m ( 72 ft ) from the base of the ditch - and 100 m ( 330 ft ) wide across the base , this is the second largest man @-@ made mound in England . The castle would have probably included a large timber keep on top of the motte , and a rectangular bailey fortification , approximately 105 by 95 m ( 344 by 312 ft ) , stretched away from the motte , exploiting the former Iron Age fortifications on one side . The new castle would have loomed over , and dominated , the former Saxon town . 
 The castle earthworks were built up from local chalk ; the ditches dug around the fortification would not have provided enough for the mound itself , and local tradition suggests that much of the earth was quarried instead from the nearby Gallows Pits in the town . The castle was constructed by hand , using workers digging with wooden shovels , and probably without pickaxes . It is estimated that the motte would have taken around 24 @,@ 000 man days of effort to build . 
 The Bigod family continued to build their grip on the region , taking advantage of their powerful castles at Thetford , Framlingham , Bungay , and Walton . Roger 's son , Hugh Bigod , played a prominent role during the civil war years of the Anarchy , rebelling against King Stephen from his strongholds in East Anglia . It appears likely that a stone wall had been built around the bailey around this time , and recent work has speculated that a stone keep was also erected on the site . At the end of the war , however , Henry II took the throne and attempted to restore royal power across the region . In 1157 , Henry seized Bigod 's castles ; he ultimately returned Framlingham and Bungay , but retained Thetford Castle for his own use . Hugh Bigod then joined the revolt by Henry 's sons , seizing the castle , but in 1173 Henry 's forces captured the castle and destroyed the fortifications . The mound , however , proved effectively <unk> .

 Thetford declined after the 12th century , and the castle rapidly became disused , although as late as 1558 , the Castle Yard was in use and still said to have been surrounded with a stone wall . In 1772 the east bank of the outer bailey was destroyed . In 1823 a group of elm trees were planted near the top of the mound . 
 Interest continued in the origins of the castle , which for a period were forgotten . Local medieval tradition suggested that the mound had been made by the devil , after he completed the dykes at Narborough and Newmarket , but by the Victorian period academics had concluded that the mound was either of Celtic or Norman origin , with late Victorian scholars correctly concluding that the Norman period was the most likely . Other traditions claimed that the mound covered a palace filled with treasure , or six silver bells from Thetford Priory . Archaeological investigations into Red Castle by G. Knocker between 1957 – 58 , and during the early 1960s by R. R. Clarke and Barbara Green revealed the design and date of this castle site .

 Hip @-@ hop dance refers to street dance styles primarily performed to hip @-@ hop music or that have evolved as part of hip @-@ hop culture . It includes a wide range of styles primarily breaking , locking , and popping which were created in the 1970s and made popular by dance crews in the United States . The television show Soul Train and the 1980s films Breakin ' , Beat Street , and Wild Style showcased these crews and dance styles in their early stages ; therefore , giving hip @-@ hop mainstream exposure . The dance industry responded with a commercial , studio @-@ based version of hip @-@ hop — sometimes called " new style " — and a hip @-@ hop influenced style of jazz dance called " jazz @-@ funk " . Classically trained dancers developed these studio styles in order to choreograph from the hip @-@ hop dances that were performed on the street . Because of this development , hip @-@ hop dance is practiced in both dance studios and outdoor spaces . 
 The commercialization of hip @-@ hop dance continued into the 1990s and 2000s with the production of several television shows and movies such as The Grind , Planet B @-@ Boy , Rize , StreetDance 3D , America 's Best Dance Crew , Saigon Electric , the Step Up film series , and The LXD , a web series . Though the dance is established in entertainment , including mild representation in theater , it maintains a strong presence in urban neighborhoods which has led to the creation of street dance derivatives Memphis jookin , turfing , jerkin ' , and krumping . 
 1980s films , television shows , and the Internet have contributed to introducing hip @-@ hop dance outside of the United States . Since being exposed , educational opportunities and dance competitions have helped maintain its presence worldwide . Europe hosts several international hip @-@ hop competitions such as the UK B @-@ Boy Championships , Juste Debout , and <unk> . Australia hosts a team @-@ based competition called World Supremacy Battlegrounds and Japan hosts a two @-@ on @-@ two competition called World Dance Colosseum . 
 What distinguishes hip @-@ hop from other forms of dance is that it is often " freestyle " ( improvisational ) in nature and hip @-@ hop dance crews often engage in freestyle dance competitions — colloquially referred to as " battles " . Crews , freestyling , and battles are identifiers of this style . Hip @-@ hop dance can be a form of entertainment or a hobby . It can also be a way to stay active in competitive dance and a way to make a living by dancing professionally . 
 = = History = = 
 Hip @-@ hop dance is a broad category that includes a variety of styles . The older dance styles that were created in the 1970s include uprock , breaking , and the funk styles . Breaking was created in The Bronx , New York , incorporating dances that were popular in the 1960s and early 1970s in African @-@ American and Latino communities . In its earliest form , it began as elaborations on James Brown 's " Good Foot " dance which came out in 1972 . Breaking at this period was not primarily floor @-@ oriented as seen today ; it started out as toprock which dancers perform while standing up . An influence on toprock was uprock which was created in Brooklyn , New York . Uprock looks similar to toprock , but it is more aggressive and looks like a fight . Uprock is also performed with partners , but in toprock — and in breaking in general — each person takes turns dancing . In 1973 , DJ Kool Herc invented the break beat . A break beat is a rhythmic , musical interlude of a song that has been looped over and over again to extend that instrumental solo . Kool Herc did this to provide a means for dancers who attended his parties to demonstrate their skills . B @-@ boy and b @-@ girl stands for " break @-@ boy " and " break @-@ girl " ; b @-@ boys and b @-@ girls dance to the break of a record . Further influenced by martial arts and gymnastics , breaking went from being a purely upright dance style — toprock only — to becoming more floor @-@ oriented . 
 At the same time breaking was developing in New York , other styles were being created in California . The funk styles refers to several street dance styles created in California in the 1970s such as roboting , bopping , hitting , locking , <unk> ' , popping , electric boogaloo , strutting , sac @-@ ing , and dime @-@ stopping . Out of all of these dances , boogaloo is one of the oldest . It started out as a 1960s fad dance and was the subject of several songs released during that time such as " Do the Boogaloo " and " My Baby Likes to Boogaloo " . From being a fad , it developed into a dance style called electric boogaloo and a music genre called Latin boogaloo . The most popular and widely practiced of the funk styles are locking and popping . The television show Soul Train played a large role in giving these styles commercial exposure . Both The Lockers and The Electric Boogaloos — dance crews responsible for the spread of locking and popping — performed on this show . 
 It is historically inaccurate to say that the funk styles were always considered hip @-@ hop . The funk styles were adopted into hip @-@ hop in large part due to the media . Once hip @-@ hop activist and DJ , Afrika Bambaataa , used the word " hip @-@ hop " in a magazine interview in 1982 , " hip @-@ hop dance " became an umbrella term encompassing all of these styles . Due to the amount of attention locking and popping were receiving , the media brought these styles under the " breakdance " label causing confusion about their origin . They were created on the west coast independent from breaking and were originally danced to funk music rather than hip @-@ hop music . 
 As breaking , locking , and popping gained popularity in the 1980s , hip @-@ hop social dancing ( party dancing ) started to develop . Novelty and fad dances such as the Roger Rabbit , the Cabbage Patch , and the Worm appeared in the 1980s followed by the Humpty dance and the Running Man in the 1990s . The music of the day was the driving force in the development of these dances . For example , the 1980s rap group Gucci Crew II had a song called " The Cabbage Patch " that the dance of the same name was based on . 2000s era social dances include the Cha Cha Slide , the Cat Daddy , and the Dougie . The previously mentioned dances are a sample of the many that have appeared since hip @-@ hop developed into a distinct dance style . Like hip @-@ hop music , hip @-@ hop social dancing continues to change as new songs are released and new dances are created to accompany them . 
 = = Main styles = = 
 = = = Breaking = = = 
 Breaking was created in the South Bronx , New York City during the early 1970s . It is the first hip @-@ hop dance style . At the time of its creation , it was the only hip @-@ hop dance style because Afrika Bambaataa classified it as one of the five pillars of hip @-@ hop culture along with MCing ( rapping ) , DJing ( turntablism ) , graffiti writing , and knowledge . Though African Americans created breaking , Puerto Ricans maintained its growth and development when it was considered a fad in the late 1970s . In a 2001 interview Richard " Crazy Legs " Colón , the president of Rock Steady Crew , commented on how Puerto Ricans contributed to breaking : " I think the difference is when the brothas first started doing [ it ] and it was at its infancy they weren 't doing acrobatic moves . That didn 't come into play until more Puerto Ricans got involved in the mid 70s . We then took the dance , evolved it and kept it alive . In ' 79 I was getting dissed . I would go into a dance and I would get dissed by a lot of brothas who would ask ' Why y 'all still doing that dance ? That 's played out ' . By 79 , there were very few African American brothas that was doing this ... We always maintained the flava . It was like a changing of the guard and all we did was add more flava to something that already existed . " Breaking includes four foundational dances : toprock , footwork @-@ oriented steps performed while standing up ; downrock , footwork performed with both hands and feet on the floor ; freezes , stylish poses done on your hands ; and power moves , complex and impressive acrobatic moves . Transitions from toprock to downrock are called " drops . " 
 Traditionally , breakers dance within a cypher or an Apache Line . A cypher is a circular shaped dance space formed by spectators that breakers use to perform or battle in . <unk> work well for one @-@ on @-@ one b @-@ boy ( break @-@ boy ) battles ; however , Apache Lines are more appropriate when the battle is between two crews — teams of street dancers . In contrast to the circular shape of a cypher , competing crews can face each other in this line formation , challenge each other , and execute their burns ( a move intended to humiliate the opponent , i.e. crotch grabbing ) . 
 = = = Locking = = = 
 Locking , originally called <unk> , was created in 1969 in Los Angeles , California by Don " Campbellock " Campbell and popularized by his crew The Lockers . In addition to Campbell , the original members of The Lockers were Fred " Mr. Penguin " Berry , Leo " <unk> Luke " Williamson , Adolfo " Shabba @-@ Doo " Quiñones , Bill " Slim the Robot " Williams , Greg " Campbellock Jr " Pope , and Toni Basil , who also served as the group 's manager . At the 2009 World Hip Hop Dance Championships , Basil became the first female recipient of the Living Legend Award in honor of her role in giving locking commercial exposure . 
 Locking looks similar to popping , and the two are frequently confused by the casual observer . In locking , dancers hold their positions longer . The lock is the primary move used in locking . It is " similar to a freeze or a sudden pause . " A locker 's dancing is characterized by frequently locking in place and after a brief freeze moving again . According to Dance Spirit magazine , a dancer cannot perform both locking and popping simultaneously ; thus , it is incorrect to call locking " pop @-@ locking " . While both styles originate in Los Angeles , locking and popping are two distinct funk styles with their own histories , their own set of dance moves , their own pioneers , and their own competition categories . Locking is more playful and character @-@ driven , whereas popping is more illusory . In popping , dancers push the boundaries of what they can do with their bodies . Locking has specific dance moves that distinguish it from popping and other funk styles . In the 2006 book Total Chaos , hip @-@ hop historian Jorge " Popmaster Fabel " Pabon lists some of these moves which include " the lock , points , <unk> [ rabbits ] , scooby doos , stop ' n go , which @-@ away , and the fancies . " In addition , Lockers commonly use a distinctive dress style , such as colorful clothing with stripes and suspenders . 
 = = = Popping = = = 
 Popping was created in Fresno , California in the 1970s and popularized by Samuel " Boogaloo Sam " Solomon and his crew the Electric Boogaloos . It is based on the technique of quickly contracting and relaxing muscles to cause a jerk in a dancer 's body , referred to as a pop or a hit . When performed correctly , each hit is synchronized to the rhythm and beats of the music . Popping is also used as an umbrella term to refer to a wide range of closely related illusionary dance styles such as strobing , liquid , animation , twisto @-@ flex , and waving . Dancers often integrate these styles with standard popping to create a more varied performance . In all of these subgenres it appears to the spectator that the body is popping . The difference between each subgenre is how exaggerated the popping is . In liquid , the body movements look like water . The popping is so smooth that the movements do not look like popping at all ; they look fluid . The opposite of this is strobing ( also called ticking ) in which the movements are staccato and jerky . 
 Popping as an umbrella term also includes gliding . Gliding is a lower body dance performed with little to no movements in the chest or arms . In gliding a dancer appears as if they are drifting across the floor on ice . Opposite from gliding is tutting , an upper body dance that uses the arms , hands , and wrists to form right angles and create geometric box @-@ like shapes . <unk> can be done primarily with the fingers rather than the arms . This method is called finger tutting . In both variations the movements are intricate , linear , and form 90 ° or 45 ° angles . In practice , tutting looks like the characters on the art of ancient Egypt , hence the name — a reference to King Tut . 
 While popping as an umbrella term is widely used by hip @-@ hop dancers and in competitive hip @-@ hop dancing , Timothy " Popin ' Pete " Solomon of the Electric Boogaloos disagrees with the use of the word " popping " in this way . Many of these related styles ( animation , liquid , tutting , etc . ) can not be traced to one person or group . Solomon states " There are people who wave and there are people who tut . They ’ re not popping . I say this to give the people who created other styles their just dues and their props . " 
 = = Derivative street styles = = 
 Decades after breaking , locking , and popping became established , four new dance styles appeared . Three of them come from California and one comes from Tennessee . Memphis <unk> ' was created in the 1980s in Memphis , Tennessee . It is an evolution of an older Memphis line dance called The Gangsta ' Walk . According to Dance magazine , jookin is characterized by dancers " gliding footwork ... popping and waving ... [ and ] using the tips of their sneakers to balance on pointe . " Gliding on tiptoes is fundamental to this dance . While watching a jookin ' battle in Jackson , Tennessee , dance critic Alastair Macaulay observed that " the most evidently sensational feature of jookin is the extensive use of what a ballet observer is bound to call pointwork : the men , in sneakers , go onto tiptoe ... many of the men not only rose onto point but also hopped , turned , ran and balanced on point . " <unk> have traditionally practiced their moves at the Crystal Palace skating rink in Memphis , which is akin to how <unk> practice their moves in public spaces in Buenos Aires . 
 <unk> , an acronym for Taking Up Room on the Floor , was created in 2002 by <unk> Bey in Oakland , California . <unk> is a fusion of miming and gliding that places heavy emphasis on storytelling ( through movement ) and illusion . Other than San Francisco Bay Area pride , turfing avoided becoming a fad due to local turf dance competitions and local youth programs that promote turfing as a form of physical activity . 
 The dance style Jerkin ' was popularized in 2009 by the New Boyz 's rap song " You 're a Jerk " . This song went viral via their MySpace page before they had a manager or were signed to a record label . After hearing about the song , Los Angeles radio station Power 106 hired the New Boyz to perform at local high schools . These shows led to " You ’ re a Jerk " entering the radio 's playlist . Later the same year , rap duo Audio Push released the song and video " Teach Me How to Jerk " which showcased the different dance moves within jerkin ' including the Reject — the Running Man done in reverse . Dancers who perform jerkin ' typically wear bright colors , skinny jeans , Mohawks , and Vans sneakers . This trend echos locking dancers in the 1970s who traditionally wore suspenders and black and white striped socks . Of the dance , journalist Jeff Weiss from LA Weekly stated " For a youth culture weaned on the cult of individualism , jerkin ’ is its apotheosis . " Similar to breaking , locking , and popping , jerkin 's popularity spread through dance crews . For example , The Rej3ctz ( crew ) created both the Cat Daddy and the Reject dance moves . 
 Although jookin ' , turfing , and jerkin ' generated regional support and media attention , none have reached the same zenith as krumping . <unk> " Tight Eyez " Willis and Jo <unk> " Big <unk> " <unk> created krumping in the early 2000s in South Central , Los Angeles . It was only practiced in Los Angeles until it gained mainstream exposure after being featured in several music videos and showcased in the krumping documentary Rize . Rize was screened at several film festivals before it was commercially released in the summer of 2005 . <unk> , the less aggressive predecessor to krumping , was created in 1992 by Thomas " Tommy the Clown " Johnson . Johnson and his dancers would paint their faces and perform clowning for children at birthday parties or for the general public at other functions as a form of entertainment . In contrast , krumping focuses on highly energetic battles and movements which Johnson describes as intense , fast @-@ paced , and sharp . Of the dance , journalist <unk> <unk> from Dance magazine stated " If movement were words , [ krumping ] would be a poetry slam . " Compared to breaking and the funk styles , jookin ' , turfing , jerkin ' , and krumping are relatively new . The music driving the dances and the cultural similarities between these street dance styles , the funk styles , and breaking have brought them together under the same subculture of hip @-@ hop .

 = = = Commercial / New Style = = = 
 The dance industry responded to hip @-@ hop dance by creating a commercial version of it . This studio hip @-@ hop , sometimes called " new style " , is the kind of hip @-@ hop dance seen in rap , R & B , and pop music videos and concerts . From the point of view of someone deeply immersed in hip @-@ hop culture , anything that looks like hip @-@ hop dance that did not come from the streets is not a true hip @-@ hop dance form . In an interview with Dance magazine , choreographer and hip @-@ hop dance teacher Emilio " Buddha Stretch " Austin , Jr. described his point @-@ of @-@ view : 
 Stage performance can suppress improvisation which defined hip @-@ hop dance early in its development . Furthermore , meshing different dance styles together dissolves their structures and identities . In an interview with The Bronx Journal , choreographer and artistic director Safi Thomas expressed a similar <unk> as Austin concerning hip @-@ hop instruction within the studio : 
 The term " new style " was created by dancers outside of the United States . According to <unk> Durden , adjunct professor at Drexel University and director of the film History and Concept of Hip @-@ Hop Dance , the 1992 dance documentary Wreckin ' Shop From Brooklyn was very influential to hip @-@ hop dancers in France and Japan . These dancers wanted to move like the New York hip @-@ hop dancers who were profiled in the documentary . They called the social dancing ( party dancing ) they saw " new style " which was short for " New York Style " . 
 In the context of the commercial dance industry , hip @-@ hop ( or new style hip @-@ hop for dancers in France and Japan ) is choreographed urban party dancing with studio technique added to it . From a technical aspect , it is characterized as hard @-@ hitting involving flexibility and isolations — moving a specific body part independently from others . The feet are grounded , the chest is down , the posture is hunched , and the body is kept loose so that dancers can easily alternate between hitting the beat or moving through the beat . Like African dance , new style hip @-@ hop is very rhythmic and involves a lot of footwork and radial movement of the hips . In addition , emphasis is placed on musicality — how sensitive your movements are to the music — and being able to freestyle ( improvise ) . As long as dancers keep the foundational movements , they can add their own ( free ) style and have a performance that is still hip @-@ hop . 
 A significant juncture in the development of hip @-@ hop was the addition of eight @-@ counts , a method of counting dance steps to stay in sync with the music . Toni Basil introduced this studio technique into locking in the 1970s . Basil was trained in ballet before being introduced to street dance by Don Campbell , the creator of locking and founding member of The Lockers dance crew . She is responsible for teaching the rest of The Lockers how to dance to counts . In an interview with NPR , Lockers member Adolfo " Shabba @-@ Doo " Quiñones stated " I would say that Toni Basil was sort of our Abe Saperstein in terms of how she was able to organize us into a professional dance troupe . I remember her teaching us how to count music . She was like , okay , we were like , count music ? How do you count soul ? It was crazy , you know ? ... all of our cues kind of went something like this , boom , pop , do boom , pada da boom , pada like that . And she was like , how do you guys get in sync like that ? I said it 's a feeling , you know ? " Traditionally hip @-@ hop dance , or any form of street dance , is not performed to counts as these styles were created on the street rather than in a studio setting . So the introduction of counts was a pivotal move into bringing hip @-@ hop dance from the street into the studio . Even with this addition , it would be years before commercial hip @-@ hop developed into its current form . 
 A second important event in the development of hip @-@ hop was the start of hip @-@ hop dance instruction . Buddha Stretch was a pioneer in this field . He started teaching formal hip @-@ hop dance classes in 1989 at Broadway Dance Center in New York City . Around the same time , hip @-@ hop party dancing started to appear in music videos and on television — this was another important point in the development and commercialization of hip @-@ hop . An early example of this is when Janet Jackson performed the Running Man in her 1989 music video for the song " Rhythm Nation " which was choreographed by street dancer Anthony Thomas . The dance was so popular during this time it was also performed by 1990s rappers MC Hammer and Vanilla Ice in their choreographed routines . Michael Jackson also used hip @-@ hop in his 1992 music video " Remember The Time " which was choreographed by a then 21 @-@ year @-@ old Fatima Robinson . At the time , Robinson was a street dancer with no formal training and " Remember the Time " was her first music video job . According to MTV.com , " Dances have always been a part of hip @-@ hop culture — from the running man to the Soulja Boy dance ... " and this era was the start of commercial hip @-@ hop choreography as it looks today : dance routines are not specific to one genre ( strictly popping , strictly locking , or strictly breaking ) but rather an amalgamation of urban party dancing with studio technique added to it . 
 = = = Jazz @-@ funk = = = 
 Another style the dance industry created in response to hip @-@ hop was jazz @-@ funk . This style was shown in its early form on a sketch comedy series called In Living Color . The resident dance troupe , The Fly Girls , opened and closed every show with a hip @-@ hop and jazz performance choreographed by Rosie Perez . Jazz @-@ funk ( also called street @-@ jazz ) is a hybrid of hip @-@ hop and jazz dance . R & B singer Beyoncé uses this style . Korean dance crew Prepix also uses this style . They have choreographed for K @-@ pop singers Jay Park and <unk> as well as for K @-@ pop boy bands 2PM and <unk> . Although jazz @-@ funk borrows from hip @-@ hop dance , it is not considered a style of hip @-@ hop because the foundational movements are jazz . In hip @-@ hop — even in lyrical hip @-@ hop — there are no pirouettes or arabesques and dancers do not perform on <unk> ( on the balls of the feet ) . However , these methods are used in jazz @-@ funk and in jazz dance in general . 
 = = = Business developments = = = 
 Other developments in the dance industry occurred in response to the growing popularity of hip @-@ hop . On the traveling convention circuit there were tap , ballet , and jazz dance conventions , but there were none specifically for hip @-@ hop . The same void existed in dancewear . There was dancewear for tap , ballet , and jazz dancers but none for hip @-@ hop dancers . Monsters of Hip Hop and Nappytabs dancewear were formed to answer to both needs . Nappytabs is the first line of hip @-@ hop dancewear . Because their clothing is made for hip @-@ hop dancers , they do not sell leotards , <unk> , tights , or leg warmers . Their line consists of tank tops , shorts , t @-@ shirts , sweat pants , harem pants , and hoodies . Monsters of Hip Hop ( MOHH ) was founded in 2003 in Baltimore , Maryland by Andy Funk , Becky Funk , and Angie Servant . The convention is dedicated exclusively to hip @-@ hop instruction . Fatima Robinson , Stefan " Mr. Wiggles " Clemente , and Timothy " Popin ' Pete " Solomon have taught classes at MOHH in the past . Every year , the convention brings together its top student dancers for a professionally choreographed showcase in Los Angeles called Monsters of Hip Hop : The Show . 
 MOHH may have been the first hip @-@ hop dance convention , but it is not the only one that exists . Urban Dance Camp ( UDC ) is a six @-@ week @-@ long German @-@ based dance convention held every year in Lörrach , a small town on the border of France and Switzerland . In a report on the event by a local paper , Bettina Kraft , the manager of UDC , estimated that 85 % of the participants were from outside of Germany . In 2009 Kraft created Urban Dance Showcase , a parallel event to UDC reserved only for performances by professional choreographers , dance crews , and UDC teachers . Dancers such as Shaun Evaristo , Les Twins , <unk> , b @-@ boy <unk> , and b @-@ boy Hong 10 have performed at the showcase in the past . 
 Aside from dancewear and conventions , developments in agency representation occurred as well . Although limited , representation for individual dancers had existed since the 1980s at the beginning of the music video era due to the pioneering work of talent agent Julie McDonald . However , the UK @-@ based dance agencies ProDance and Superbad Talent were created to exclusively represent street dancers .

 The entertainment industry has been largely responsible for introducing hip @-@ hop dance to mainstream audiences around the world . The first hip @-@ hop films Wild Style , Beat Street , and Breakin ' were made in the 1980s . When Wild Style opened in Japan , Rock Steady Crew performed breaking in Tokyo 's Harajuku shopping district to promote the film . Wild Style was the first movie centered around hip @-@ hop culture ; however , Flashdance was the first commercially released film to feature breaking . In 1984 , Beat Street was released in West Germany and screened at the Cannes Film Festival which helped to introduce breaking , graffiti writing , and turntablism to this part of Europe . Breakin ' and Breakin ' 2 : Electric Boogaloo brought the funk styles to the cinema . Breaking , locking , popping , and waacking — a style of house dance — were performed in these films . At this time in the 1980s , the United States was not the only country producing hip @-@ hop films . In 1985 , Yuen Woo @-@ ping directed a hip @-@ hop themed romantic comedy in Hong Kong called <unk> Couples starring Donnie Yen . Another hip @-@ hop film , Electro Rock , was released the same year in the United Kingdom . This film featured a then 14 @-@ year @-@ old Hanifa " Bubbles " McQueen Hudson , the UK 's first b @-@ girl . 
 Several hip @-@ hop dance films were produced after the millennium . The <unk> Kids : A History of the B @-@ Boy , <unk> Unlimited , B @-@ Girl , Bouncing Cats , Planet B @-@ Boy , and Battle of the Year : The Dream Team all showcase breaking . Films such as Honey , Save the Last Dance , You Got Served , the Step Up film series , StreetDance 3D , Hype Nation , Saigon Electric , Berlin Dance Battle 3D , and ABCD : Any Body Can Dance showcase all forms of hip @-@ hop dance , especially new style hip @-@ hop . Rize , The Heart of <unk> , and Shake City 101 are documentaries about krumping . All of these movies and documentaries are examples of films where the plot and theme surround hip @-@ hop dance and how it affects the characters ' lives . Bouncing Cats is the story of b @-@ boy Abraham " <unk> " <unk> who uses b @-@ boying to empower youth in Uganda . In 2010 , the film won " Outstanding Achievement in Documentary Filmmaking " at Newport Beach Film Festival and " Best Documentary Feature " at <unk> Film Festival . Saigon Electric was Vietnam 's first hip @-@ hop film . It was written , produced , and directed by Vietnamese @-@ American filmmaker Stephane <unk> . The film is about two female dancers ( a ribbon dancer and a hip @-@ hop dancer ) and how their respective romances , the threat of their community center being torn down , and the stress of an upcoming dance battle affects their friendship . The film was choreographed by Viet Max and Ricky Cole . In 2012 , it won a Golden Kite Prize ( the Vietnamese equivalent of The Oscars / BAFTAs ) for " Best Film " and " Best Actress " . 
 = = = Television = = = 
 Before reaching movie audiences , hip @-@ hop dance was already being broadcast on television . Soul Train was a syndicated , music variety show that featured social dancing and performances by African @-@ American soul , funk , and R & B singers . The show was broadcast in South Korea via the US Armed Forces Korea Network . Before officially becoming a crew , The Lockers made several appearances on this show . After becoming a crew , The Electric Boogaloos also appeared on the show . Soul Train premiered in 1970 . During its 36 year run , the resident freestyle dancers were referred to as the Soul Train Gang . Auditions were held in 1971 when the show moved from Chicago , Illinois to Los Angeles , California . Dancers who wanted to get on Soul Train after this time had to rely on word @-@ of @-@ mouth recommendations from dancers who were already employed by the show . A regular feature during the broadcast was the Soul Train Line . To participate in the Soul Train Line , the dancers formed two lines of equal length facing each other with a large space in between them . Each dancer in line would take their turn dancing down the middle . 
 Other music variety shows on television at this time were American Bandstand , Solid Gold , and Top of the Pops . Unlike Soul Train which focused on soul and funk , these shows promoted Top 40 music and pop acts . Solid Gold employed a permanent dance troupe called the Solid Gold Dancers who performed choreographed routines to musical performances . Lucinda Dickey , an actress and dancer who played the lead role in the Breakin ' films , appeared on the show during the 1982 – 1983 season as a Solid Gold dancer . In 1983 , street dancers Marc " Mr. Freeze " <unk> from Rock Steady Crew , Timothy " Popin ' Pete " Solomon and Dane " Robot Dane " Parker from the Electric Boogaloos , and locking dancers Alpha " Omega " Anderson and Lewis " Deputy " Green also appeared on Solid Gold during a performance to the song " What a Feeling " from the movie Flashdance . In 1982 during a performance in London on Top of the Pops , street dancer Jeffrey Daniel performed popping and the backslide during the song " A Night to Remember " . This was the first time popping was shown on British television thus spreading its popularity in the United Kingdom . A year later , Michael Jackson also performed the backslide during a performance of " Billie Jean " on the Motown 25 TV special . He called it the moonwalk and his performance spread its popularity all over the world to much larger extent than Daniel 's performance did . It was Jeffrey Daniel who taught Michael Jackson how to do the backslide / moonwalk . 
 A few hip @-@ hop dance shows appeared on television in the 1990s such as 1991 's The Party Machine with Nia Peeples and 1992 's The Grind . Several hip @-@ hop dance shows premiered in the 2000s including ( but not limited to ) Dance Fever , Dance 360 , The Wade Robson Project , MTV Dance Crew , America 's Best Dance Crew , Dance on Sunset , and Shake It Up . In 2006 , MTV France documented the creation of a dance crew for an original series called MTV Dance Crew . Viewers were able to see the crew from auditions to the selection of the final eight who were subsequently named Original Soul . Original Soul was coached by three professional choreographers who mentored them and helped refine their dancing . Over the course of 32 episodes they routinely participated in professional dance battles including the popping battle at Juste Debout , the Seven 2 Smoke battle at The Notorious <unk> , and b @-@ boy battles at <unk> Battle Pro . B @-@ boy <unk> , b @-@ boy crew Phase T , and promoter Bruce <unk> ( the founder of Juste Debout ) all made appearances during the show . 
 The founders of Hip Hop International , Howard and Karen Schwartz , created the reality hip @-@ hop dance competition America 's Best Dance Crew ( ABDC ) in 2008 . On the show , different crews competed in dance challenges against each other every week . ABDC contributed to the exposure of several crews such as Jabbawockeez , Quest , Beat Freaks , and Poreotics . These crews now have official websites , work with musical artists , and perform at live events . The JabbaWockeeZ had a show in Las Vegas , Nevada called MÜS.I.C. at the Monte Carlo Resort and Casino . MÜS.I.C. was the first hip @-@ hop dance stage show on the Las Vegas Strip . In 2012 , the Jabbawockeez performed the show during a five @-@ month residency at the Jupiters Hotel and Casino in Gold Coast , Queensland , Australia . Both Poreotics and Hokuto " Hok " Konishi from Quest were nominated for a 2011 MTV Video Music Award for Best Choreography . Poreotics was nominated with singer Bruno Mars for his video " The Lazy Song " . Hok was nominated for LMFAO 's video " Party Rock Anthem " ; the rest of Quest crew appeared in the video as featured dancers . 
 In contrast to ABDC , individual dancers from all backgrounds compete on the reality dance competition So You Think You Can Dance ( SYTYCD ) . It has a similar premise to the Idol series of singing competitions with initial auditions leading to the selection of a winner over the course of several episodes . In 2008 , poppers Robert " Mr. Fantastic " <unk> and Phillip " Pacman " <unk> auditioned during season four of the US series . Neither made it to the final " Top 20 " , but the judges were so impressed with their dancing that both were invited back to participate in a popping battle against each other on the show 's live finale . According to <unk> , this was the first popping battle that was nationally televised . After the battle , hip @-@ hop dancer Joshua Allen was declared the winner of season four of the competition . The same year Mona @-@ Jeanette <unk> , a hip @-@ hop dancer from Norway , won the first season of So You Think You Can Dance Scandinavia . 
 Hip @-@ hop dance has also been popular among viewers of the Got Talent series . French hip @-@ hop dancer Salah won the first season of <unk> Talent in 2006 . French b @-@ boy Junior won the second season in 2007 . In 2008 , hip @-@ hop dancer George Sampson won Britain 's Got Talent , Danish popping and roboting duo Robot Boys won Talent 2008 ( da ) , and hip @-@ hop dance crew Quick won the Norwegian version of the show . After George Sampson , dance crew Diversity won the next season of Britain 's Got Talent in 2009 . The same year , Brazilian crew D @-@ <unk> won Qual é o Seu <unk> ? ( What 's Your Talent ? ) . In 2010 , Justice Crew won Australia 's Got Talent . After signing a recording contract with Sony Music Australia , Justice Crew shot a video for their single " Dance with Me " featuring rapper Flo Rida and America 's Best Dance Crew alumni Beat Freaks . In 2015 , nine years after he won <unk> Talent , hip @-@ hop dancer Salah won the fourth season of Arabs Got Talent .

 Though hip @-@ hop dancing is established on film and on television , it has not gained the same level of exposure in theater . This may be due to the fact that the dance is performed more in film and in television than it is in a theatrical setting . B @-@ boy and popper Stefan " Mr. Wiggles " Clemente and hip @-@ hop historian Jorge " Popmaster Fabel " Pabon were involved in hip @-@ hop theater at its inception . Their dance company , GhettOriginal , produced the first hip @-@ hop stage shows : 1991 's off Broadway musical So ! What Happens Now ? and 1995 's Jam on the Groove . Both shows were performed by the Rock Steady Crew , Magnificent Force , and the Rhythm Technicians . Aside from the pioneers in New York City was Rennie Harris ' Puremovement hip @-@ hop theater company . Harris founded Puremovement in 1992 in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . One of Puremovement 's theater shows Rome & Jewels won two Black Theater Alliance Awards and three Bessie Awards . In 2012 , Harris and his company toured Egypt , Israel , and the Palestinian territories as part of Dance Motion USA , a program sponsored by the US State Department to showcase American dance to other countries and promote cultural exchange . 
 German b @-@ boy pioneer Niels " Storm " Robitzky has his performance roots in hip @-@ hop theater . In 1991 , Robitzky — who went by the name " Swipe " — left Germany with his crew Battle Squad for New York City to look for b @-@ boy legends they could study under . When he got to New York , he met b @-@ boy Gabriel " <unk> " Dionisio who personally mentored him and introduced him to New York techniques . While in New York , he also learned about the funk styles from Clemente . Clemente and Dionisio knew each other since Dionisio was an original member of both GhettOriginal and the Rhythm Technicians . A year later in 1992 , Robitzky performed with GhettOriginal at the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. and at the Lincoln Center in New York City . It was Dionisio who gave Robitzky a new name , " Storm " . In 2000 , he wrote a book called Von Swipe zu Storm : Breakdance in Deutschland ( From Swipe to Storm : Breakdance in Germany ) . 
 Dancers in the United Kingdom have had success in hip @-@ hop theater . In 2006 , hip @-@ hop dance company Boy Blue Entertainment won a Laurence Olivier Award for their show Pied Piper . In 2008 , Into the Hoods became the first hip @-@ hop theater show to perform in London 's West End . It eventually went on to become the West End 's longest running dance show ever . According to Clemente , the future of hip @-@ hop dance is in theater ; he believes it is necessary for the dance to make this transition in order for it to be legitimized as an art form .

The majority of the dancing shown in the series is hip @-@ hop ; however , other styles have also been performed including jazz , tap , and ballet . <unk> gave the series a favorable review stating " ... each episode of ' LXD ' packs a wealth of narrative sophistication into its eight or nine minutes . Combine this with the theater @-@ worthy production values and a cast that exerts itself to an ungodly extent , and the end result is – pun time ! – extraordinary . " The LXD premiered July 7 , 2010 on Hulu . In 2012 , Jon Chu , the writer , director , and producer of The LXD launched a dance channel on YouTube called <unk> ( pronounced D @-@ Studio ) . <unk> has videos of master classes , freestyle dance , and original choreographed performances . Through this channel , Chu also made The LXD available on YouTube . Before then , it could only be viewed on Hulu .

 = Wasteland Angel = 
 Wasteland Angel is a vehicular combat shoot ' em up video game created by the Finnish independent developer team Octane Games . Released on September 1 , 2011 , the game is published by Meridian4 for Windows and is distributed online through Steam , Impulse , GamersGate , Direct2Drive , and Amazon Download . 
 The game is set after a fictional World War III in a post @-@ apocalyptic United States where various gangs prey on towns in which survivors from the war have gathered . The player assumes the role the eponymous female protagonist , Angel , as she defends the towns and searches for her lost friend . The game is played from a bird 's eye view as the player controls a car and its mounted machine guns in order to destroy enemies and vehicles . Players can find more powerful guns to attach to the car and can also use special weapons such as napalm or spike strips which are picked up after killing certain enemies . 
 The game was the first to be released under the Octane Games brand . It received average reviews from critics upon release , with IGN 's Gord Goble writing that his main issue with the game was that it was very short and lacked any lasting appeal . Shortly after the game 's release , an update was made available that added support for dual @-@ monitors , support for editable key configurations , and more destructible objects to the game . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 The story , told through the use of voiced and animated comic panels , centers on Angel , a heroine in a post @-@ apocalyptic United States that travels from town to town protecting helpless survivors of the war from attacking gangs . Angel defends the towns using Gypsy , the name given to her armored car equipped with mounted machine guns . The game uses an overhead view as the player speeds around a small town using Gypsy 's machine guns to repel enemy gangs known as Wastelanders . There are three types of Wastelanders and each one unleashes attacks in a different manner : The <unk> class will attempt to capture the townspeople , Killers will only attack the player , and Duals can take on either the role of attacking or capturing during a raid . When enemies are killed , they leave behind weapons for the player such as napalm , land mines , or Electromagnetic pulse bombs ( <unk> ) ; or they drop upgrades which improve the car 's weapons or armor . The <unk> are used to temporarily disable all the enemies on the screen while the napalm and land mines can be set between waves as traps for unsuspecting Wastelanders . One weapon upgrade offers players incendiary ammunition for the car 's machine guns which makes it easier to destroy enemies by lighting them on fire . 
 The game offers four different difficulty settings and includes online leaderboards which enumerate high scores that different players have achieved for the game . The game is segmented into protecting six different villages , and each village is broken up into four levels : a Day level , a Boss level , a Night level , and a bonus level . Levels are further broken into waves as increasingly difficult enemies attack the village . The bonus level drops the top @-@ down camera view and is played from the perspective of the driver seat of the car . Boss levels confront the player with a boss enemy that is much stronger than the other enemies encountered in the game . Each boss requires the player to discover and employ a predefined strategy in order to defeat them . For example , the first boss is a giant steamroller with an attached flamethrower that can not be damaged by the car 's regular guns and instead requires the use of napalm to destroy it . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The game is set after a fictional World War III , the events of which have killed off much of the population ; those left alive are forced to fight for survival . Some of the survivors have formed gangs , some turned into mutants from the war 's radiation , and some joined an evil militia ; collectively , these groups are known as Wastelanders . Raiding different towns and villages , the Wastelanders sought to prey on the townspeople by stealing supplies , forcing some into slavery , and killing others . The heroine of the story , Angel , travels from town to town in search of her lost friend , Ekx , while helping the town 's survivors fend off attacks from Wastelanders . Cruising in her armored car , Gypsy , she makes use of the car 's mounted machine guns to defend the towns from thieves and slavers . The first lead Angel finds on her lost friend is from the city of Core , where Ekx was seen traveling through the city on his way to <unk> . Angel reaches <unk> and uses her armored car to defend the city from members of the renegade militia . After repelling the enemy , the townspeople re @-@ establish their wireless communications and contact the nearby city of New Dallas . Recognizing the voice on the other end , the receiving operator in New Dallas turns out to be Angel 's lost friend , Ekx . Ekx confides in Angel that he needs her for something urgent and that she must join him in New Dallas . 
 Shortly after arriving , the city is forced to rally all of its survivors , including Angel and Ekx , in order to fend off an incoming attack from the Renegades . The two friends become separated during the fighting , but not before Ekx gives a mysterious book to Angel . After making her way to the city of <unk> , Angel encounters Wastelanders worshiping a mystic that claims the earth was not destroyed by nuclear war , but by a " crack in the universe . " Angel is skeptical of these claims , although Ekx believes her to be the deliverer . After receiving a mission from Ekx , Angel heads through the badlands , north , to a survivor camp . Despite rumors that the place may be flooded , the game ends as Angel heads to New York to find out why Ekx has entrusted her with the mysterious book .

Before the release , the group had already announced the second game they were working on : a pirate role @-@ playing game titled Raven 's Cry . Although Wasteland Angel is published by Meridian4 , Raven 's Cry was signed to be published by <unk> Interactive . In the announcement for Wasteland Angel , the publisher noted plans to make additional downloadable content available for the game after it was launched . In an August 2011 interview , Octane Games CEO Jussi Tähtinen stated that the company was focusing on multiplatform development and that Wasteland Angel seemed in ideal fit to be marketed for the Xbox 360 and PlayStation 3 , but he declined to share any specific plans to bring the game to either platform . When asked about the possibility of a multiplayer mode , Tähtinen again declined to make any announcement .

 Wasteland Angel received average reviews upon release , garnering a rating of 55 % on the review aggregation website GameRankings . Gamers Daily News ' Jeff Lindsey appreciated the perspective change accompanying the bonus level , stating , " To be perfectly honest , I squealed with delight when I got to see the carnage first hand and create mayhem before your eyes . " Strategy Informer was not as appreciative of the jump in perspective , noting that the game 's maps and engine did not appear to be designed for the first @-@ person perspective and the mode instead presented itself as " more than a little jarring . " While Travis <unk> of Gaming Nexus criticized the game for having poor driving physics , Shack News 's Jeff <unk> enjoyed the controls , stating , " Though there are certain liberties taken with the driving physics , they feel right at home with the frantic , arcade @-@ style action . " Ultimately , <unk> did not recommend the game , but Lindsey called it " the most fun game that I have played this year " . 
 = Skinner 's Room = 
 Skinner 's Room is a short story by William Gibson originally composed for Visionary San Francisco , a 1990 museum exhibition exploring the future of San Francisco . It features the first appearance in Gibson 's fiction of " the Bridge " , which Gibson revisited as the setting of his acclaimed Bridge trilogy of novels . In the story , the Bridge is overrun by squatters , among them Skinner , who occupies a shack atop a <unk> . An altered version of the story was published in Omni magazine and subsequently anthologized . " Skinner 's Room " was nominated for the 1992 Locus Award for Best Short Story . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 The story takes place in a near @-@ future where the United States is in decline , having been negatively affected by some event referred to as the " devaluations . " It is set in a decaying San Francisco in which the San Francisco – Oakland Bay Bridge is closed and taken over by the homeless . The wealthy denizens of the city have retreated to gated @-@ access enclaves . The room mentioned in the title is a shack built on top one of the bridge 's towers . Skinner has lived on the bridge , and in his room , for a long time , and is accompanied by a girl with an interest in the history of the bridge town and who arrived only three months before . 
 The story reveals that , long ago , the Bridge had been closed to vehicle traffic ( for three years ) and that the pressure to find somewhere to live had forced homeless people to seize the bridge and set up a squatters ' town there . The community that arose was vibrant and was watched by the world 's media . The town grew in a piecemeal fashion , built from salvaged parts as well as from material apparently donated by more wealthy nations . At the end of the story Skinner has a dream in which he remembers being at the front of the crowd who seized the bridge ( Skinner is the first onto the bridge ) and scaled the towers . 
 = = Publication history = = 
 " Skinner 's Room " was commissioned by the San Francisco Museum of Modern Art for its exhibition " Visionary San Francisco " , shown from June 14 to August 26 , 1990 . Gibson 's story inspired a contribution to the exhibition by architects Ming Fung and Craig Hodgetts . Ming and Hodgetts designed the urban environment which would have catalysed the transformation of the Bridge . They envisioned a San Francisco in which the rich live in high @-@ tech , self @-@ sufficient , self @-@ contained towers , above the decrepit city and its crumbling bridge , isolated from the amorphous city . The crate @-@ packaged installation , which was surrounded by scrap metal , computer chips , and pages from manga comic strips , featured a model of the towers , along with Gibson on a monitor discussing the future and reading from " Skinner 's Room " . 
 A slightly different version of the short story was featured in the November 1991 issue of Omni . The <unk> version concerns an unnamed girl and an old man named Skinner who live in the one @-@ room shack built on top of the first cable tower of the Bridge . This version was collected in Gardner Dozois ' 1992 anthology The Year 's Best Science Fiction : Ninth Annual Collection , and in Larry McCaffery 's After Yesterday 's Crash ( 1995 ) . 
 = = Significance = = 
 " Skinner 's Room " is the first appearance of the Bridge in Gibson 's fiction . In the acknowledgments at the end of his 1994 novel Virtual Light , Gibson writes that the short story later developed into the novel ; the character of Skinner is one of the main characters in Virtual Light and the setting and characters of " Skinner 's Room " are revisited in the sequels to the novel , Idoru and All Tomorrow 's Parties ( collectively known as the Bridge trilogy ) . 
 The New York Times hailed the " Visionary San Francisco " exhibition as " one of the most ambitious , and admirable , efforts to address the realm of architecture and cities that any museum in the country has mounted in the last decade " . Despite organiser Paulo <unk> 's claim that the collaboration was an " appeal to civic responsibility by showing the effects of its absence " , The New York Times judged Ming and Hodgetts 's reaction to " Skinner 's Room " a " powerful , but sad and not a little cynical , work " . After its 1991 republication in <unk> , " Skinner 's Room " was nominated for the Locus Award for Best Short Story in 1992 . 
 = Operation Biting = 
 Operation Biting , also known as the Bruneval Raid , was the code name given to a British Combined Operations raid on a German radar installation at Bruneval in northern France , which took place on the night of 27 – 28 February 1942 during World War II . 
 A number of these installations were identified from Royal Air Force ( RAF ) aerial reconnaissance photographs during 1941 , but their exact purpose and the nature of the equipment that they possessed was not known . A number of British scientists believed that these stations were connected with the heavy losses being experienced by RAF bombers conducting bombing raids against targets in Occupied Europe . The scientists requested that one of these installations be raided and the technology it possessed be studied and , if possible , extracted and brought back to Britain for further examination . Due to the extensive coastal defences erected by the Germans to protect the installation from a seaborne raid , it was believed that a Commando raid from the sea would suffer heavy losses and give sufficient time for the garrison at the installation to destroy the Würzburg radar set . It was therefore decided that an airborne assault followed by seaborne evacuation would be the most practicable way to surprise the garrison of the installation , seize the technology intact , and minimise casualties to the raiding force . 
 On the night of 27 February , after a period of intense training and several delays due to poor weather , a company of airborne troops under the command of Major John Frost parachuted into France a few miles from the installation . The main force then assaulted the villa in which the radar equipment was kept , killing several members of the German garrison and capturing the installation after a brief firefight . An RAF technician with the force dismantled the Würzburg radar array and removed several key pieces , after which the force withdrew to the evacuation beach . The detachment assigned to clear the beach had initially failed to do so , but the German force guarding it was soon eliminated with the help of the main force . The raiding troops were picked up by landing craft , then transferred to several Motor Gun Boats which returned them to Britain . 
 The raid was entirely successful . The airborne troops suffered relatively few casualties , and the pieces of the radar they brought back , along with a captured German radar technician , allowed British scientists to understand enemy advances in radar and to create countermeasures to neutralise them . 
 = = Background = = 
 After the end of the Battle of France and the evacuation of British troops from Dunkirk during Operation Dynamo , much of Britain 's war production and effort was channeled into RAF Bomber Command and the strategic bombing offensive against Germany . However , bomber losses on each raid began to increase during 1941 , which British intelligence concluded was due to German use of advanced radar equipment . The British and Germans had been competing in radar technology for nearly a decade at this point , with the Germans often either at the same level as the British or surpassing them due to heavy investment in the fledgling technology . By the beginning of World War II , British scientific advances in radar had reached effective levels , primarily due to the work of Robert Watson @-@ Watt , although much of the technology was still rudimentary in nature and mistakes were made , such as the inability of Watson @-@ Watt and other scientists to devise an effective night @-@ defence system in time for the German nighttime bombing of Britain during 1940 . Another British scientist working on radar systems and techniques was R. V. Jones , who had been appointed in 1939 as Britain 's first Scientific Intelligence Officer and had spent the first years of the conflict researching how advanced German radar was in comparison to Britain , and convincing doubters that the Germans actually had radar . 
 By examining leaked German documents , crashed Luftwaffe bombers , Enigma decryptions , and through German prisoner of war interrogations , Jones discovered that high @-@ frequency radio signals were being transmitted across Britain from somewhere on the Continent , and he believed they came from a directional radar system . Within a few months of this discovery , Jones had identified several such radar systems , one of which was being used to detect British bombers ; this was known as the " Freya @-@ <unk> @-@ Freya " array , named after the ancient Norse goddess . Jones was finally able to see concrete proof of the presence of the Freya system after being shown several mysterious objects visible in reconnaissance pictures taken by the RAF near Cap d 'Antifer - two circular emplacements in each of which was a rotating " mattress " antenna approximately 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) wide . Having found proof of these Freya installations , Jones and the other scientists under his command could begin devising countermeasures against the system , and the RAF could begin to locate and destroy the installations themselves . Jones had also found evidence of a second part of the Freya set @-@ up , referred to in Enigma decrypts as " Würzburg " , but it was not until he was shown another set of RAF reconnaissance photographs in November 1941 that he learned what Würzburg was . It consisted of a parabolic antenna about 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) in diameter , which worked in conjunction with Freya to locate British bombers and then direct Luftwaffe night fighters to attack them . The two systems complemented each other : Freya was a long @-@ range early @-@ warning radar system , but lacked precision , whereas Würzburg had a much shorter range but was far more precise . Würzburg also had the advantage of being much smaller than the Freya system and easier to manufacture in the quantities needed by the Luftwaffe to defend German territory . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 In order to effectively neutralise the Würzburg system by developing counter @-@ measures against it , Jones and his team needed to study one of the systems , or at least the more vital pieces of technology of which the system was composed . Fortunately for them , one such site had recently been located by an RAF reconnaissance Spitfire from the Photographic Reconnaissance Unit during a flight over part of the French English Channel coast near Le Havre . The site was located on a clifftop immediately north of the village of Bruneval , which was itself twelve miles north of Le Havre , and was the most accessible German radar site that had been located so far by the British ; several other installations were located further inland in France , and others were as far away as Romania and Bulgaria . A request for a raid on the Bruneval site to capture a Würzburg system was passed on to Admiral Lord Louis Mountbatten , the commander of Combined Operations . Mountbatten in turn took the proposal to the Chiefs of Staff Committee , who approved the raid after a brief debate . Having received permission to conduct the raid , Mountbatten and his staff studied the Bruneval installation and its defences , rapidly coming to the conclusion that due to the extensive coastal defences in the area around the installation it was too well @-@ guarded to permit a seaborne Commando raid . They considered that such a raid would result in high casualties among the attacking troops and would not be fast enough to capture the Würzburg radar before it was destroyed by the Germans . Believing that surprise and speed were to be the essential requirements of any raid against the installation to ensure the radar was captured , Mountbatten saw an airborne assault as the only viable method . On 8 January 1942 , he therefore contacted the headquarters of 1st Airborne Division and 38 Wing RAF , asking if they were able to conduct the raid . The division 's commander , Major @-@ General Frederick Browning , was particularly enthusiastic , as a successful operation would be an excellent morale boost to the airborne troops under his command , as well as a good demonstration of their value . 
 The two commanders believed that training by both airborne troops and aircrews could be completed by the end of February , when there would be suitable meteorological conditions for such an operation to take place . Training for the raid was begun immediately , but encountered several problems . 38 Wing was a new unit still in the process of formation , so No. 51 Squadron RAF under Wing Commander Percy Charles Pickard was selected to provide the aircraft and aircrew needed for the operation , although Group Captain Nigel Norman of 38 Wing would remain in overall command . Another problem encountered was the state of training of the unit of airborne troops chosen to raid the installation . During this period , 1st Airborne Division was composed of only two parachute battalions , of which only one ( 1st Parachute Battalion ) , was fully trained . Browning , wishing to keep 1st Parachute Battalion intact for any larger operation the division might be selected for , ordered 2nd Parachute Battalion to provide a company for the operation . ' C ' Company commanded by Major John Frost was selected , but the company had been so recently formed that Frost and many of his men had not yet completed their parachute jumping course . The level of security imposed on the planning for the raid was so high that when Major Frost was first briefed by a liaison officer from the headquarters of 1st Airborne Division , he was informed that his company was to take part in an airborne warfare demonstration for the War Cabinet . He was also informed that C Company would be divided into four sections for the exercise , which was contrary to a plan Frost had devised for the exercise and confused him . It was only after Frost raised several objections with a more senior officer at headquarters that he was informed of the intended raid , after which the Major dropped his objections and turned his attention to training the company . 
 = = = Training = = = 
 The company spent time on Salisbury Plain in Wiltshire , and then travelled to Inveraray in Scotland where they underwent specialised training on Loch Fyne , practising night <unk> on landing craft to prepare the company for evacuation by sea after raiding the radar installation . After this , the unit returned to Wiltshire and began carrying out practice parachute drops with the aircraft and aircrews of 51 Squadron . Despite the aircrews having no previous experience in dropping parachutists , these exercises proved to be successful . The company 's working @-@ up was aided by the creation of a scale @-@ model of the radar installation and the surrounding buildings being built by the Photographic Interpretation Unit . During this period , Major Frost was introduced to Commander F. N. Cook of the Royal Australian Navy who would be commanding the naval force intended to evacuate the company at the completion of the raid , as well as to the detachment of thirty @-@ two officers and men from No. 12 Commando who would arrive in the landing craft and cover the company as it withdrew from the beach . Frost also met RAF Flight Sergeant <unk> Cox , who had volunteered to accompany C Company for the operation ; as an expert radio mechanic , it would be his job to locate the Würzburg radar set , photograph it , and to dismantle part of it for transportation back to Britain . Derek Garrard of Jones ' team asked Jones to obtain an Army uniform and identification number for Cox , as he would be the object of special attention from the Germans if he was captured in Air Force uniform , but the War Office were obdurate . 
 Information about the Bruneval radar installation was also gathered during this period , often with the help of the French Resistance , without whom detailed knowledge of the disposition of the German forces guarding the installation would have been impossible . This information was gathered by Gilbert Renault , known to the British by the code @-@ name ' Remy ' and several members of his resistance cell . The installation was composed of two distinct areas ; a villa approximately 100 yards ( 91 m ) from the edge of a cliff which contained the radar station itself , and an enclosure containing a number of smaller buildings which contained a small garrison . The Würzburg antenna was erected between the villa and the cliff . The radar station was permanently manned by Luftwaffe radar technicians and was surrounded by a number of guard posts and approximately thirty guards ; the buildings in the small enclosure housed approximately 100 German troops , including another detachment of technicians . A platoon of German infantry was stationed to the south in Bruneval itself , and was responsible for manning the defences guarding the evacuation beach ; these included a strongpoint near the beach as well as pillboxes and machine gun nests on the top of the cliff overlooking the beach . The beach was not mined and had only sporadic barbed @-@ wire defences , but it was patrolled regularly ; a mobile reserve of infantry was believed to be available at one hour 's notice and stationed some distance inland . 
 On the basis of this information , Frost decided to divide the company into five groups of forty men for the raid , each named after a famous Royal Navy admiral : ' Nelson ' , ' Jellicoe ' , ' Hardy ' , ' Drake ' and ' Rodney ' . ' Nelson ' would clear and secure German positions defending the evacuation beach , whilst ' Jellicoe ' , ' Hardy ' and ' Drake ' would capture the radar site , villa and the enclosure . ' Rodney ' was the reserve formation , placed between the radar site and the main likely enemy approach to block any counterattack . It was considered that the combination of a full moon for visibility , and a rising tide to allow the landing craft to manoeuvre in shallow water , was vital for the success of the raid , which narrowed the possible dates to a four @-@ day period between 24 – 27 February . On 23 February , a final rehearsal exercise took place , which proved to be a failure ; despite ideal weather conditions , the evacuation landing craft grounded 60 yards ( 180 ft ) offshore and could not be shifted despite the efforts of the crews and troops . 
 = = The raid = = 
 The raid was postponed for several days after the 23 February rehearsal due to weather conditions , but on 27 February the weather proved to be ideal , with clear skies and good visibility for the aircraft of 51 Squadron , and a full moon which would provide illumination for the evacuation of the raiding force . The naval force under Commander Cook departed from Britain during the afternoon , and the Whitley transport aircraft carrying C Company took off from RAF <unk> in the evening . The aircraft crossed the English Channel without incident , but as they reached the French coast they came under heavy antiaircraft fire ; however , none of them was hit , and they successfully delivered C Company to the designated drop zone near the installation . The drop was almost a total success , with the majority of the raiding force landing on the edge of the drop zone ; however , half of the ' Nelson ' detachment landed two miles short of the DZ . Once the other detachments had gathered their equipment and orientated themselves , they moved off to undertake their arranged tasks . ' Jellicoe ' , ' Hardy and ' Drake ' encountered no enemy opposition as they moved towards the villa housing the radar installation , and after surrounding the villa Frost gave the order to open fire with grenades and automatic fire . One German guard was killed as he returned fire from an upstairs window , and two more were taken prisoner by the airborne troops ; upon interrogation , the prisoners revealed that the majority of the garrison were stationed further inland . There still remained a substantial enemy force in the buildings in the small enclosure near the villa , and this now opened fire on the raiding force after being alerted by the initial firefight , killing one of the airborne troops . The volume of fire rapidly increased , when enemy vehicles could be seen moving towards the villa from the nearby woods ; this in particular worried Frost , as the radio sets the force had been issued failed to work , giving him no means of communication with his other detachments , including ' Nelson ' who were tasked with clearing the evacuation beach . Fortunately for the British , Flight Sergeant Cox and several sappers arrived at this time and proceeded to dismantle the radar equipment , placing the pieces on specially designed trolleys . 
 Having secured the radar equipment and under heavy enemy fire , Major Frost gave the order for the three detachments to withdraw to the evacuation beach ; it became apparent , however , that the beach had not been secured by the under @-@ strength ' Nelson ' detachment when a German machine gun opened fire on the airborne troops , severely wounding the company sergeant major . Frost ordered ' Rodney ' and the available men of ' Nelson ' to clear the defenses , whilst he led the other three detachments back to the villa , which had been reoccupied by enemy troops . The villa was soon cleared of enemy troops once more , and when Frost returned to the beach , he found that the machine @-@ gun nest had been destroyed by the mis @-@ dropped troops of ' Nelson ' ; avoiding a number of enemy positions , they had reached the beach and attacked the machine @-@ gun post from the flank . By this time it was 02 : 15 but there was no sign of the naval force that was to evacuate the airborne troops . Frost ordered ' Nelson ' to guard the inland approaches to the beach and then fired off an emergency signal flare ; soon after that the naval force was seen approaching . The original plan for the operation had called for two landing craft at a time to land on the beach , but this had never been satisfactorily achieved during training ; instead , all six landing craft landed at the same time , with the covering troops in the landing craft opening fire on German soldiers gathering at the top of the cliff . This deviation from the original evacuation plan and the enemy fire caused considerable confusion on the beach ; some of the landing craft left the beach over @-@ crowded , whilst others left half @-@ empty . However , the radar equipment , German prisoners and the entire raiding force were embarked and transferred to motor gun boats for transport back to Britain . On the return journey , Frost learned that the naval force had received no signals apart from the signal flare , and had spent much of the time hiding from a German naval patrol that had nearly discovered them . The journey back to Britain was uneventful , with the force being escorted by four destroyers and a flight of Spitfires . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The success of the raid against the Bruneval installation had two important effects . First , a successful raid against German @-@ occupied territory was a welcome morale boost for the British public , and featured prominently in the British media for several weeks afterwards . The British Prime Minister , Winston Churchill took a personal interest in the operation , and on 3 March assembled the War Cabinet to hear from Major Frost and several other officers who had participated in it . Several medals were awarded as a result . On 15 May 1942 a special supplement to the London Gazette carried the announcement of 19 decorations ; Frost was awarded the Military Cross ( MC ) , Cook the Distinguished Service Cross ( DSC ) and Cox the Military Medal ( MM ) ; there were two other <unk> , two Distinguished Service Medals ( DSM ) , one other MC , two further MMs and nine Mentions in Despatches ( <unk> ) . Wing Commander Pickard was also subsequently awarded a bar to his Distinguished Service Order , on 26 May . The success of the raid also prompted the War Office to expand the existing British airborne forces , setting up the Airborne Forces Depot and Battle School in Derbyshire in April 1942 , and creating the Parachute Regiment as well as converting a number of infantry battalions to airborne battalions in August 1942 . 
 The second and most important result of the raid was the technical knowledge that British scientists gained . Examination of the components of the radar array showed that it was of a modular design that aided maintenance and made fixing faults far simpler than on similar British radar models . This was confirmed during the interrogation of the captured German technician , who proved to be less well trained than his British counterparts . Examination of the radar array also allowed British scientists to conclude that they would have to deploy a countermeasure that had recently been developed , code @-@ named Window . Examination of the Würzburg array showed that it was impervious to being jammed by conventional means used by the British during the early years of the conflict ; thus Window would have to be deployed against German radars . The effectiveness of Window against Würzburg radar arrays was confirmed by a raid conducted by RAF Bomber Command on 24 July 1943 against Hamburg ( Operation Gomorrah ) ; when the bombers utilised Window , all of the radar arrays in Hamburg were blinded and their operators confused , unable to distinguish between the radar signature of a real bomber and several pieces of Window giving off a similar signature . An unexpected bonus of the Bruneval raid was the Germans ' efforts to improve defences at Würzburg stations and prevent similar attacks . The radars were surrounded by rings of barbed wire which increased their visibility from the air , making them easier to target prior to Operation Overlord . 
 One final consequence of the raid was that the Telecommunications Research Establishment , where much of the Bruneval equipment was analysed , and British radar systems were designed and tested , was moved further inland from Swanage on the southern coast of England to Malvern to ensure that it was not the target of a reprisal raid by German airborne forces . 
 The original model of the area around the radar station , used to brief troops taking part in the assault , is preserved in the Parachute Regiment and Airborne Forces Museum , located at the Imperial War Museum Duxford . 
 = River dolphin = 
 River dolphins are a widely distributed group of fully aquatic mammals that reside exclusively in freshwater or brackish water . They are an informal grouping of dolphins , which is a paraphyletic group within the infraorder Cetacea . The river dolphins comprise the extant families Platanistidae ( the Indian dolphins ) , Iniidae ( the Amazonian dolphins ) , and Pontoporiidae ( the brackish dolphins ) . There are five extant species of river dolphins , and two subspecies . River dolphins , alongside other cetaceans , belong to the clade Cetartiodactyla , with even @-@ toed ungulates , and their closest living relatives the hippopotamuses , having diverged about 40 million years ago . 
 River dolphins are relatively small compared to other dolphins , having evolved to survive in the warm and strong river currents . They range in size from the 5 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) long South Asian river dolphin to the 8 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) and 220 @-@ pound ( 100 kg ) Amazon river dolphin . Several species exhibit sexual dimorphism , in that the males are larger than the females . They have streamlined bodies and two limbs that are modified into flippers . River dolphins use their conical @-@ shaped teeth and long beaks to capture fast @-@ moving prey in murky water . They have well @-@ developed hearing that is adapted for both air and water ; they do not really rely on vision since the water they swim in is usually very muddy . These species are well @-@ adapted to living in warm , shallow waters , and , unlike other cetaceans , have little to no blubber . 
 River dolphins are not very widespread ; they are all restricted to certain rivers or deltas . This makes them extremely vulnerable to habitat destruction . River dolphins feed primarily on fish . Male river dolphins typically mate with multiple females every year , but females only mate every two to three years . Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them . River dolphins produce a variety of vocalizations , usually in the form of clicks and whistles . 
 River dolphins are rarely kept in captivity ; breeding success has been poor and the animals often die within a few months of capture . As of 2015 , there are only three river dolphins in captivity .

 Four families of river dolphins ( Iniidae , Pontoporiidae , <unk> and Platanistidae ) are currently recognized , comprising three superfamilies ( <unk> , Lipotoidea and Platanistoidea ) . Platanistidae , containing the two subspecies of South Asian river dolphin , is the only accepted family of Platanistoidea . Previously , many taxonomists had assigned all river dolphins to a single family , Platanistidae , and treated the Ganges and Indus River dolphins as separate species . A December 2006 survey found no members of Lipotes vexillifer ( commonly known as the baiji , or Chinese river dolphin ) and declared the species functionally extinct . With their disappearance , one of the recently accepted superfamilies , Lipotoidea , has become extinct . 
 The current classification of river dolphins is as follows :

 In 2012 the Society for Marine Mammalogy began considering the Bolivian ( Inia geoffrensis boliviensis ) and Amazonian ( Inia geoffrensis geoffrensis ) subspecies as full species Inia boliviensis and Inia geoffrensis , respectively ; however , much of the scientific community , including the IUCN , continue to consider the Bolivian population to be a subspecies of Inia geoffrensis . 
 In October 2014 , the Society for Marine Mammalogy took Inia boliviensis and Inia <unk> off their list of aquatic mammal species and subspecies and currently does not recognize these species @-@ level separations . 
 = = = Evolution = = = 
 River dolphins are members of the infraorder Cetacea , which are descendants of land @-@ dwelling mammals of the order Artiodactyla ( even @-@ toed ungulates ) . They are related to the Indohyus , an extinct chevrotain @-@ like ungulate , from which they split approximately 48 million years ago . The primitive cetaceans , or archaeocetes , first took to the sea approximately 49 million years ago and became fully aquatic by 5 – 10 million years later . It is unknown when river dolphins first ventured back into fresh water . 
 River dolphins are thought to have relictual distributions , that is , their ancestors originally occupied marine habitats , but were then displaced from these habitats by modern dolphin lineages . Many of the morphological similarities and adaptations to freshwater habitats arose due to convergent evolution ; thus , a grouping of all river dolphins is paraphyletic . Amazon river dolphins are actually more closely related to oceanic dolphins than to South Asian river dolphins . <unk> panamensis is an extinct genus and species of river dolphin , living 5 @.@ 8 to 6 @.@ 1 million years ago . Its fossils were discovered near <unk> , Panama . 
 River dolphin has been considered a taxonomic description , suggesting an evolutionary relationship among the group , although it is now known that they form two distinct clades . ' True ' river dolphins are descendants of ancient evolutionary lineages that evolved in freshwater environments . 
 Some species of cetacean live in rivers and lakes , but are more closely related to oceanic dolphins or porpoises and entered fresh water more recently . Such species are considered facultative freshwater cetaceans as they can use both marine and freshwater environments . These include species such as the Irrawaddy dolphin , <unk> brevirostris , found in the Mekong , Mahakam , the Irrawaddy Rivers , as well as the Yangtze finless porpoise <unk> <unk> <unk> . 
 The tucuxi ( <unk> fluviatilis ) in the Amazon River is another species descended from oceanic dolphins ; however , it does not perfectly fit the label of ' facultative ' either , as it occurs only in fresh water . The tucuxi was until recently considered conspecific with the Guiana dolphin ( <unk> <unk> ) , which inhabits marine waters . It may also be true for the Irrawaddy dolphin and the finless porpoise that , although the species may be found in both freshwater and marine environments , individual animals found in rivers may not be able to survive in the ocean , and vice versa . The tucuxi is currently classified as an oceanic dolphin ( Delphinidae ) . 
 The Franciscana ( Pontoporia blainvillei ) has shown a converse evolutionary pattern , and has an ancient evolutionary lineage in freshwater , but inhabits estuarine and coastal waters . 
 = = Biology = = 
 = = = Anatomy = = = 
 River dolphins have a torpedo shaped body with a flexible neck , limbs modified into flippers , non @-@ existent external ear flaps , a tail fin , and a small bulbous head . River dolphin skulls have small eye orbits , a long snout and eyes placed on the sides of the head . River dolphins are rather small , ranging in size from the 5 @-@ foot ( 1 @.@ 5 m ) long South Asian river dolphin to the 8 @-@ foot ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) and 220 @-@ pound ( 100 kg ) Amazon river dolphin . They all have female @-@ biased sexual dimorphism , with the females being larger than the males . River dolphins are polygynous , meaning male river dolphins typically mate with multiple females every year , but females only mate every two to three years . Calves are typically born in the spring and summer months and females bear all the responsibility for raising them . 
 River dolphins have conical teeth , used to catch swift prey such as small river fish . They also have very long snouts , with some measuring 23 inches ( 58 cm ) , four times longer than most of their oceanic counterparts . They have a two @-@ chambered stomach that is similar in structure to that of terrestrial carnivores . They have fundic and pyloric chambers . Breathing involves expelling stale air from their blowhole , followed by inhaling fresh air into their lungs . They do not have the iconic spout , as this only forms when the warm air exhaled from the lungs meets cold external air , which does not occur in their tropical habitats . 
 River dolphins have a thin layer of blubber , this is due to a lack of necessity . Blubber can help with buoyancy , protection from predators ( they would have a hard time getting through a thick layer of fat ) , energy for leaner times , and insulation from harsh climates . The habitats of river dolphins lack these needs . 
 = = = Locomotion = = = 
 River dolphins have two flippers and a tail fin . These flippers contain four digits . Although river dolphins do not possess fully developed hind limbs , some possess discrete rudimentary appendages , which may contain feet and digits . River dolphins are slow swimmers in comparison to oceanic dolphins , which can travel at speeds up to 35 miles per hour ( 56 km / h ) ; the tucuxi can only travel at about 14 miles per hour ( 23 km / h ) . Unlike other cetaceans , their neck vertebrae are not fused together , meaning they have greater flexibility than other non @-@ terrestrial aquatic mammals , at the expense of speed . This means they can turn their head without actually moving their entire body . When swimming , river dolphins rely on their tail fins to propel themselves through the water . Flipper movement is continuous . River dolphins swim by moving their tail fins and lower bodies up and down , propelling themselves through vertical movement , while their flippers are mainly used for steering . All species have a dorsal fin . 
 = = = Senses = = = 
 The ears of river dolphins have specific adaptations to their aquatic environment . In humans , the middle ear works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air 's low impedance and the cochlear fluid 's high impedance . In river dolphins , and other cetaceans , there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments . Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear , river dolphins receive sound through the throat , from which it passes through a low @-@ impedance fat @-@ filled cavity to the inner ear . The ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air @-@ filled sinus pockets , which allows for greater directional hearing underwater . Dolphins send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon . This melon consists of fat , and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression . This allows river dolphins to produce biosonar for orientation . They are so dependent on echolocation that they can survive even if they are blind . Beyond locating an object , echolocation also provides the animal with an idea on the object 's shape and size , though how exactly this works is not yet understood . The small hairs on the rostrum of the Amazon river dolphin are believed to function as a tactile sense , possibly to compensate for their poor eyesight . 
 River dolphins have very small eyes for their size , and do not have a very good sense of sight . In addition , the eyes are placed on the sides of the head , so the vision consists of two fields , rather than a binocular view like humans have . When river dolphins surface , their lens and cornea correct the nearsightedness that results from the refraction of light . They have both rod and cone cells , meaning they can see in both dim and bright light . Most river dolphins have slightly flattened eyeballs , enlarged pupils ( which shrink as they surface to prevent damage ) , slightly flattened corneas and a tapetum lucidum ; these adaptations allow for large amounts of light to pass through the eye and , therefore , a very clear image of the surrounding area . They also have glands on their eyelids and an outer corneal layer that act as protection for the cornea . 
 Olfactory lobes are absent in river dolphins , suggesting that they have no sense of smell . 
 River dolphins are not thought to have a sense of taste , as their taste buds are atrophied or missing altogether . However , some dolphins have preferences between different kinds of fish , indicating some sort of attachment to taste .

 Development and agriculture have had devastating impacts on the habitats on river dolphins . The total population of <unk> river dolphins is estimated to be between 600 and 1 @,@ 500 individuals , and genetic diversity is limited . The ecology of their habitat has been adversely affected by agricultural , ranching and industrial activities , as well as by the use of dams for hydroelectric power . The inhabited section of the Araguaia River probably extends over about 900 miles ( 1 @,@ 400 km ) out of a total length of 1 @,@ 300 miles ( 2 @,@ 100 km ) . The Tocantins river habitat is fragmented by six hydroelectric dams , so the population there is at particular risk . Its probable eventual IUCN status is Vulnerable or worse . 
 Both subspecies of South Asian river dolphins have been very adversely affected by human use of the river systems in the subcontinent . Irrigation has lowered water levels throughout both subspecies ' ranges . Poisoning of the water supply from industrial and agricultural chemicals may have also contributed to population decline . Perhaps the most significant issue is the building of more than 50 dams along many rivers , causing the segregation of populations and a narrowed gene pool in which the dolphins can breed . Currently , three subpopulations of Indus river dolphins are considered capable of long @-@ term survival if protected . 
 As China developed economically , pressure on the baiji river dolphin grew <unk> and residential waste flowed into the Yangtze . The riverbed was dredged and reinforced with concrete in many locations . Ship traffic multiplied , boats grew in size , and fishermen employed wider and more lethal nets . Noise pollution caused the nearly blind animal to collide with propellers . Stocks of the dolphin 's prey declined drastically in the late 20th century , with some fish populations declining to one thousandth of their pre @-@ industrial levels . In the 1950s , the population was estimated at 6 @,@ 000 animals , but declined rapidly over the subsequent five decades . Only a few hundred were left by 1970 . Then the number dropped down to 400 by the 1980s and then to 13 in 1997 when a full @-@ fledged search was conducted . On December 13 , 2006 , the baiji ( Lipotes vexillifer ) was declared " functionally extinct " , after a 45 @-@ day search by leading experts in the field failed to find a single specimen . The last verified sighting was in September 2004 .

 The region of the Amazon in Brazil has an extension of 3 @,@ 100 @,@ 000 sq mi ( 8 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 km2 ) containing diverse fundamental ecosystems . One of these ecosystems is a floodplain , or a várzea forest , and is home to a large number of fish species which are an essential resource for human consumption . The várzea is also a major source of income through excessive local commercialized fishing . <unk> consist of muddy river waters containing a vast number and diversity of nutrient @-@ rich species . The abundance of distinct fish species lures the Amazon River dolphin into the várzea areas of high water occurrences during the seasonal flooding . 
 In addition to attracting predators such as the Amazon river dolphin , these high @-@ water occurrences are an ideal location to draw in the local <unk> fishing activities directly compete with the dolphins for the same fish species , the <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) and the <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , resulting in deliberate or unintentional catches of the Amazon river dolphin . The local fishermen <unk> , and when the Amazon River dolphins remove the commercialized fish from the nets and lines , it damages the equipment and the capture and causes a negative reaction from the local fishermen . The Brazilian Institute of Environment and Renewable Natural Resources prohibit fishermen from killing the Amazon river dolphin , yet they are not compensated for the damage to their equipment and the loss of their catch . 
 = = = = Bycatch = = = = 
 During the process of catching the commercialized fish , the Amazon river dolphins get caught in the nets and exhaust themselves until they die , or the local fishermen deliberately kill the dolphins that become entangled in their nets . The carcasses are discarded , consumed , or used as bait to attract a scavenger catfish , the piracatinga ( <unk> <unk> ) . The use of the Amazon river dolphin carcass as bait for the piracatinga dates back from 2000 . The increasing consumption demand by the local inhabitants and Colombia for the piracatinga has created a market for distribution of the Amazon river dolphin carcasses to be used as bait throughout these regions . 
 For example , of the 15 dolphin carcasses found in the <unk> River in 2010 – 2011 surveys , 73 % of the dolphins were killed for bait , disposed of , or abandoned in entangled gillnets . The data does not fully represent the actual overall number of deaths of the Amazon river dolphins , whether accidental or intentional , because a variety of factors make it extremely complicated to record and medically examine all the carcasses . Scavenger species feed upon them and the complexity of the river currents makes it nearly impossible to locate all the carcasses . More importantly , the local fishermen do not report these deaths out of fear that legal action will be taken against them , as the Amazon river dolphin and other cetaceans are protected under the Brazilian federal law , prohibiting any takes , harassments , and kills of the species .

 A baiji conservation dolphinarium was established at the Institute of Hydrobiology ( <unk> ) in Wuhan in 1992 . This was planned as a backup to any other conservation efforts by producing an area completely protected from any threats , and where the baiji could be easily observed . The site includes an indoor and outdoor holding pool , a water filtration system , food storage and preparation facilities , research labs and a small museum . The aim is to also generate income from tourism which can be put towards the baiji plight .

Douglas Adams and Mark Carwardine documented their encounters with the endangered animals on their conservation travels for the BBC programme Last Chance to See . The book by the same name , published in 1990 , included pictures of a captive specimen , a male named Qi Qi ( <unk> ) that lived in the Wuhan Institute of Hydrobiology dolphinarium from 1980 to July 14 , 2002 . Discovered by a fisherman in Dongting Lake , he became the sole resident of the Baiji Dolphinarium ( <unk> ) beside East Lake . A sexually mature female was captured in late 1995 , but died after half a year in 1996 when the Shishou Tian @-@ e @-@ Zhou Baiji Semi @-@ natural Reserve ( <unk> ) , which had contained only finless porpoises since 1990 , was flooded . 
 The Amazon river dolphin has historically been kept in dolphinariums . Today , only three exist in captivity : one in Acuario de Valencia in Venezuela , one in <unk> de <unk> in Peru , and one in Duisburg Zoo in Germany . Several hundred were captured between the 1950s and 1970s , and were distributed in dolphinariums throughout the US , Europe , and Japan . Around 100 went to US dolphinariums , and of that , only 20 survived ; the last died in Pittsburgh Zoo in 2002 .

 In Hindu mythology , the Ganges River Dolphin is associated with Ganga , the deity of the Ganges river . The dolphin is said to be among the creatures which heralded the goddess ' descent from the heavens and her mount , the Makara , is sometimes depicted as a dolphin . 
 In Chinese mythology , the baiji has many origin stories . For example , near the mouth of the Yangtze , the baiji was a princess that had lost her parents and had lived with her step @-@ father , whom she had longed to get away from . The step @-@ father wanted to trade her since she would have been sold for a great sum of money , but as they were crossing the river to get to the trader , a storm rolled in , and they were drenched . The step @-@ father , enraged , tried to take her , but she plunged herself into the river . Before being drowned in the river , she was transformed into a dolphin , and swam away from her abusive step @-@ father , who also fell in and was transformed into a porpoise . 
 In another story further upstream the Yangtze , the baiji was the daughter of a general who was deported from the city of Wuhan during a war . During his duty , the daughter ran away . Later , the general met a woman who told him how her father was a general , and when he realized that she was his daughter , he threw himself into the river out of shame . The daughter ran after him and also fell into the river . Before they were drowned , the daughter was transformed into a dolphin , and the general a porpoise .

 Amazon river dolphins , known by the natives as the boto or encantados , are very prevalent in the mythology of the native South Americans . They are often characterized in their mythology as wielding superior musical ability , their seductiveness and love of sex , often resulting in illegitimate children , and their attraction to parties . Despite the fact that the <unk> are said to come from a utopia full of wealth and without pain or death , the encantados crave the pleasures and hardships of human societies . 
 Transformation into human form is said to be rare , and usually occurs at night . The <unk> will often be seen running from a festa , despite protests from the others for it to stay , and can be seen by pursuers as it hurries to the river and reverts to dolphin form . When it is under human form , it wears a hat to hide its blowhole , which does not disappear with the shapeshift . 
 Besides the ability to shapeshift into human form , encantados frequently wield other magical abilities , such as the power to control storms , enchant humans into doing their will , transform humans into encantados themselves , and inflict illness , insanity , and even death . Shamans often intervene in these situations . 
 Kidnapping is also a common theme in such folklore . <unk> are said to be fond of abducting humans with whom they fall in love , children born of their illicit love affairs , or just about anyone near the river who can keep them company , and taking them back to the <unk> . The fear of this is so great among people who live in the Amazon river area that both children and adults are terrified of going near the water between dusk and dawn , or entering water @-@ bodies alone . Some who supposedly have encountered encantados while out in their canoes have been said to have gone insane , although in fact , the creatures seem to have done little more than follow their boats and nudge them from time to time .

 = Cyclone Wasa – Arthur = 
 Severe Tropical Cyclone Wasa – Arthur was the first major tropical cyclone to affect French Polynesia and Tahiti since the 1982 @-@ 83 season . The system was first noted on December 3 , 1991 as a shallow tropical depression that was embedded within the monsoon trough , to the north of the Cook Island : Rarotonga . Over the next couple of days the system gradually developed further , before it was classified as a tropical cyclone and named Wasa during December 5 . The system gradually strengthened further and acquired hurricane @-@ force winds on December 6 , as it performed a small clockwise loop . After completing the loop , Wasa moved southwards before it peaked in intensity during December 8 , with sustained wind speeds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) . Over the next few days the system started to weaken as it passed through the French Polynesian Society Islands , and became the first major tropical cyclone to affect French Polynesia since 1983 . 
 During December 12 , Wasa passed through the French Polynesian Austral Islands and passed directly over Tubuai , before it degenerated into a tropical depression later that day . However , gale force winds remained associated with the depression , before the system turned towards the east @-@ northeast and entered into warmer waters near the Tuamotu Islands . During December 14 , Wasa regenerated into a tropical depression and was renamed Arthur for various reasons . During that day the system gradually intensified before it reached its secondary peak intensity with sustained wind speeds of 95 km / h ( 60 mph ) . During December 15 , the system maintained its peak intensity , as it moved through the uninhabited <unk> Group of islands , before during the next day it started to gradually weaken . Arthur degenerated into a shallow depression during December 17 , before it was last noted during the next day as it dissipated to the north of the Pitcairn islands . 
 Tourists on the island of Bora Bora were evacuated to a local church , after Wasa – Arthur had swept high seas into tourist bungalows . Overall the system caused an estimated US $ 60 million in damage within French Polynesia , with the majority of the damage done between December 9 – 12 . The system destroyed or damaged several homes , a variety of crops and damaged several public buildings , hotels , roads and power installations , with the worst affected islands being Bora Bora and Tubuai . On Rurutu island , Moerai harbour was destroyed by a cyclonic swell generated by the system , while the local school and police station were destroyed by high waves . Two people were killed after torrential rainfall from the system caused a mudslide on the island of Moorea , during a night of torrential rain the day after Wasa had made its closest approach to the island . The French Government incurred costs of about <unk> million including <unk> million for the efforts of the French Military . The French Polynesian Government subsequently borrowed <unk> million and built up a fund from local banks of about <unk> billion , to help with the reconstruction . The name Wasa was later retired , from the list of tropical cyclone names by the World Meteorological Organization .

 On December 3 , the Fiji Meteorological Service started to monitor a shallow tropical depression , that had developed within a monsoon trough about 1 @,@ 250 km ( 775 mi ) to the north of Rarotonga , in the Southern Cook Islands . Over the next two days , the system gradually developed further as it moved towards the southwest , before during December 5 , the Naval Western Oceanography Center ( NWOC ) started to monitor the depression and designated it as Tropical Cyclone 07P after it had become equivalent to a tropical storm . Later that day , TCWC Nadi reported that the system had developed into a category one tropical cyclone on the Australian tropical cyclone intensity scale and named it Wasa , while it was located about 250 km ( 160 mi ) to the south @-@ west of the Cook Islands <unk> . During December 6 , Wasa developed hurricane force winds in an area of low vertical wind shear as it performed a small clockwise loop before it started to move towards the southeast during December 8 , as an equatorial westerly wind burst affected the system . Early on December 8 , the NWOC reported that Wasa had peaked in intensity with 1 @-@ minute sustained wind speeds of 195 km / h ( 120 mph ) , which made it equivalent to a category 3 hurricane on the Saffir @-@ Simpson hurricane wind scale . TCWC Nadi subsequently reported during the next day , that Wasa had become a Category 4 Severe tropical cyclone , as it reached its peak intensity with 10 @-@ minute sustained winds of 165 km / h ( 105 mph ) . 
 Over the next few days the system started to weaken as it passed through the French Polynesian Society Islands , and became the first major tropical cyclone to affect French Polynesia since 1983 . During December 12 , Wasa passed through the French Polynesian Austral Islands and passed directly over Tubuai . Later that day , TCWC Nadi reported that the system had weakened into a tropical depression , before the NWOC issued their final advisory on Wasa during December 13 . However , gale force winds remained associated with the depression , in particular within the systems southeastern quadrant , the system subsequently turned and started to move towards the east @-@ northeast and entered into warmer waters near the Tuamotus . TCWC Nadi subsequently reported during December 14 , that the system had regenerated into a category one tropical cyclone and renamed it : Arthur , for various reasons including operational purposes and to avoid confusion among recipients of their warnings . During that day the system gradually intensified further , as it passed about 130 km ( 80 mi ) to the north @-@ northwest of the atoll : Mururoa , with the automatic weather station there reporting sustained wind speeds of 70 km / h ( 45 mph ) . At 12 : 00 UTC TCWC Nadi reported that Wasa – Arthur had re @-@ peaked with 10 @-@ minute sustained wind speeds of 95 km / h ( 60 mph ) , which made it a category 2 tropical cyclone on the Australian scale . During the next day the system maintained its peak intensity and moved through the uninhabited <unk> Group of islands and several other atolls , before as Wasa @-@ Arthur turned eastwards , the NWOC decided to classify the storm as Tropical Cyclone <unk> , with peak 1 @-@ minute sustained wind speeds of 85 km / h ( 55 mph ) . During December 16 , the system started to gradually weaken as it turned more towards the east , before it degenerated into a shallow depression late the next day . The remnant depression was last noted dissipating during December 18 , to the north of the Pitcairn islands .

 During December 9 , ahead of Cyclone Wasa affecting French Polynesia , the High Commissioner Jean <unk> , declared a state of maximum alert which closed schools and banned navigation . On December 12 , tourists on the island of Bora Bora were evacuated to a local church , after the system had swept high seas into tourist bungalows . Overall Cyclone Wasa – Arthur caused an estimated US $ 60 million in damage within the six Leeward Islands , the two Windward Islands of Tahiti and Moorea and several of the Austral Islands with the majority of the damage done between December 9 – 12 . The system destroyed 367 homes , damaged 855 other homes , destroyed or damaged a variety of crops and damaged several public buildings , hotels , roads and power installations , with the worst affected islands were Bora Bora and Tubuai . On Rurutu island , Moerai harbour was destroyed by a cyclonic swell generated by the system , while the local school and police station were destroyed by high waves . A women and her child were killed while asleep , after torrential rainfall from Wasa caused a mudslide on the island of Moorea the day after the system had made its closest approach to the island . 
 During the aftermath of the cyclone , a French Military cargo plane and several helicopters carried out initial relief efforts to several of the islands affected by Wasa , before the French Polynesian Government and private cargo ships continued the effort , by carrying emergency relief supplies and reconstruction materials . The French Government 's Minister for Overseas France : Louis Le Pensec arrived in Tahiti on December 15 , to inspect the damage and explore ways of rebuilding the island nation , after similar tours were conducted by the President of French Polynesia , Gaston <unk> and several of his cabinet ministers . During the emergency period , the French Government incurred costs of about <unk> million including <unk> million for the efforts of the French Military . The French Polynesian Government subsequently borrowed <unk> million from the Central Fund for Economic Cooperation and built up a fund from local banks of about <unk> billion , to help with the reconstruction of infrastructure and territorial buildings . The name Wasa was later retired , from the list of tropical cyclone names by the World Meteorological Organization . 
 = Wilton St Hill = 
 Wilton H. St Hill was a West Indian cricketer who played in West Indies ' first Test match during their inaugural Test tour of England . A right @-@ handed batman who played in a variety of batting positions , he represented Trinidad in first @-@ class cricket between 1912 and 1930 and played in three Test matches in total . Although his Test record was poor , he was highly regarded in Trinidad . In particular , writer C. L. R. James considered St Hill to be among the top batsmen in the world and dedicated a chapter of Beyond a Boundary to him . At the peak of his career , Lord Harris described him as the best batsman in the West Indies . 
 Establishing an early reputation playing for the Shannon Club in Trinidad , St Hill was selected for Trinidad in 1912 and played in every Inter @-@ Colonial Tournament until 1930 . Although he missed selection for the 1923 tour of England , he played for representative West Indian sides in 1926 against the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) and scored a century against the tourists for Trinidad . Success in trial matches led to his selection for the 1928 tour of England where he failed badly . In 1930 , he hit another century for Trinidad against MCC and was chosen for one final Test , after which he did not play any further first @-@ class cricket . 
 One of the first successful black batsmen in the West Indies , St Hill was an enigmatic character who refused to compromise his playing style . Towards the end of his career , his aggression while batting , even when out of form , resulted in his dismissal without scoring many runs . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 St Hill was born on 6 July 1893 in Port of Spain , Trinidad , and according to C. L. R. James , his family were lower middle @-@ class . He had two brothers who played first @-@ class cricket for Trinidad , Cyl and Edwin ; the latter also played Test matches for West Indies . Cricket in Trinidad at the time was divided along racial lines . For cricket clubs on the island , the colour of a player 's skin was crucial . St Hill played for Shannon , a club associated with black lower middle @-@ class players such as teachers or clerks . Another club , Maple , was associated with middle @-@ class people but would only accept men with a lighter skin tone . When someone said to St Hill that Maple would welcome a player as good as him , he replied , " Yes , but they wouldn 't want my brothers " , both of whom were darker skinned . By 1912 , St Hill found a job in a department store and remained in this position all his life . By this stage , he had established a good reputation as a batsman and was popular with players and spectators .

 St Hill was chosen to play for Trinidad in 1912 and made his first @-@ class debut against British Guiana in the Inter @-@ Colonial Tournament . Batting at number nine in the batting order , he scored four runs in his only innings and did not bowl in an innings victory by <unk> . He retained his place in the tournament final against Barbados and after another failure batting at number eight , he was more successful , scoring 59 not out in the second innings from number nine , sharing a last wicket partnership of 67 . However , Barbados won the match easily . St Hill 's only other matches before the First World War were both against the Marylebone Cricket Club ( MCC ) in 1913 . Now batting at number three , St Hill scored 76 runs in three innings with a top score of 33 . There were no inter @-@ colonial matches that season and the First World War suspended first @-@ class competition . 
 When cricket resumed in February 1920 , St Hill was selected in two matches against Barbados as Trinidad travelled to Barbados . Trinidad were heavily defeated in both games . St Hill scored 18 and 41 in the first game opening the batting , and after scoring two runs at number four in the second game , reverted to opening and scored 96 , sharing an opening partnership of 140 with C. P. Cumberbatch . The next tournament took place in Trinidad during September 1921 , and St Hill scored 104 runs from number three — his maiden first @-@ class century — as Trinidad defeated British Guiana . The final against Barbados was affected by rain and left drawn when Barbados had to catch the boat home ; St Hill scored six runs , batting at number three , and 48 batting at number six . In the inter @-@ colonial matches of September 1922 , St Hill continued to bat in a variety of positions , batting at numbers three , five and six , as well as opening the batting . However , he scored just 49 runs in four innings . Although Trinidad reached the final , they were once more heavily defeated by <unk> . 
 C. L. R. James believes that St Hill planned to play professional cricket in England around this point , but his failure in the trial matches meant that he was not selected to tour England with the West Indies team in 1923 . James records how upset St Hill 's supporters were by his omission and they believed the West Indian selectors feared a black batsman being successful in England . He also describes St Hill became more single @-@ minded and less willing to moderate his approach after this decision . 
 When St Hill played in Trinidad 's next match in February 1924 , he was joined in the team by his brother Edwin , who took six wickets on his first @-@ class debut . St Hill was less successful , batting at number five and scoring 6 and 23 , but Trinidad once again defeated British Guiana to reach the final against Barbados . In the final , he was promoted to open the batting but did not reach double figures in either innings and a century from George Challenor helped Barbados to win the tournament once again ; by this point , they had won all but one of the matches played against Trinidad in the years St Hill was in the team . St Hill played in a non @-@ first @-@ class match against the Windward Islands later that year , scoring a fifty in the second innings .

 Playing at home in the Inter @-@ Colonial Tournament , Trinidad once again defeated British Guiana in February 1925 and St Hill opened the batting to score 13 and 29 . Playing Barbados in the final , Trinidad won a very close match by 13 runs . St Hill , batting at number three , scored 66 and 64 , having not scored a first @-@ class fifty since 1921 . As winners of the competition , Trinidad qualified for the final without playing another team in October 1925 ; British Guiana defeated Barbados but lost in the final . St Hill , remaining at number three , scored 100 in the first innings , but was dismissed for a duck in the second as Trinidad gained a narrow victory by two wickets . 
 The following January , the MCC toured West Indies . The tourists played matches against a representative West Indian side for which St Hill was selected . In the first match in Barbados , he scored just one run in his only innings batting at number four and the home side just managed to secure a draw . The MCC then played two games against Trinidad both of which were drawn . St Hill batted at number three in both matches . In the first , St Hill scored 45 but in the second he scored 20 and a two @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half hour 105 . Lord Harris , having seen this innings , described St Hill as the best batsman in the West Indies . In the remaining two representative matches , St Hill scored 32 , 36 and 72 batting at three or five . In the three representative games , St Hill scored 141 runs at an average of 35 @.@ 25 , but the MCC won the series 1 – 0 . 
 As defending champions , Trinidad again qualified for the final of the Inter @-@ Colonial Tournament in January 1927 and faced Barbados , the home team on this occasion . In a high @-@ scoring match which lasted for eight days , Barbados recovered from being 384 runs behind after the first innings . St Hill contributed a first innings duck and a score of 18 in the second innings , batting down the order . Later in the year , St Hill took part in the trial matches for the 1928 tour of England . Playing for British Guiana and Trinidad against Barbados and Jamaica , he scored 144 , the highest innings of his career . St Hill was particularly severe on the bowling of George Francis , a bowler who had represented West Indies . In the other matches , scores of 45 , 44 and 71 , secured his place in the touring team . 
 = = = Failure in England = = = 
 Expectations for St Hill were high before the tour and Lord Harris predicted St Hill would be a success in England . In a preview of the 1928 English cricket season , The Times commented that the West Indies team was an unknown quantity but singled out St Hill as one of two promising batsmen on the team . The same newspaper later noted his exciting batting style , and described him as " one of the best batsmen on the side , from whom much is expected later on " . However , all the touring batsmen were hampered by a cold , wet summer and humid conditions which helped the ball to move through the air . Furthermore , they had to deal with pitches on which the ball spun further and travelled slower after bouncing than they were accustomed to in the Caribbean . St Hill would not or could not adapt his usual attacking style to the unfamiliar conditions . According to James , he was " a horrible , a disastrous , an incredible failure " . Making a succession of low scores , he passed fifty only once in first @-@ class games , against Oxford University and scored one century in a minor match against Durham . He played 35 innings in total and reached double figures only 15 times , while in first @-@ class matches he reached double figures just eight times in 25 innings . Despite his poor form , St Hill played in the first two Test matches , making 4 and 9 during West Indies inaugural Test , batting at number five and scoring 3 and 38 in the second Test , batting at number four . West Indies lost both games and lost their first Test series 3 – 0 . After the end of July , St Hill only played once more on the tour . In total , he scored 262 first @-@ class runs at an average of 10 @.@ 91 . Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack described St Hill as the " big disappointment " of the tour , noting that he tried to attack the bowling too early in his innings and therefore rarely succeeded . Nevertheless , the correspondent commented on his range of shots on the off side . 
 = = = End of career = = = 
 Following St Hill 's return to the West Indies , the Inter @-@ Colonial Tournament took place in Trinidad during January and February 1929 . The home team defeated British Guiana before beating Barbados by an innings in the final . St Hill batted at number three throughout but managed scores of just 4 , 23 and 5 . However , Trinidad could not defend their title in October as British Guiana defeated the team by four wickets . St Hill batted at number seven in the first innings and three in the second innings but made just 11 runs in the match . 
 The MCC toured once again in early 1930 , where the team played two games against Trinidad , although St Hill only appeared in the first . Again batting at number three , he scored 16 in the first innings but accumulated 102 in the second — his final first @-@ class century . Concentrating on defence , St Hill batted for four hours showing more patience than he had done before . James wrote that " the eagle had clipped his own wings at last " . St Hill was selected for the Test on his home ground in Trinidad and had his best match statistically . Batting at number three in the first innings , he scored 30 and opened the batting to score 33 in the second innings . Wisden described him as batting steadily , but West Indies lost the match and St Hill did not play any further Test or first @-@ class cricket . In three Tests , he scored 117 runs at an average of 19 @.@ 50 and in 43 first @-@ class games , he hit 1928 runs at 27 @.@ 15 with five centuries . He also took five wickets . 
 By 1931 , St Hill remained successful in local Trinidad cricket , but one newspaper report suggested that he had " fallen off considerably " in terms of form , and was unlikely to play for West Indies again . Very little is known about the remainder of his life . There are no details about his death , although he is believed to have died around 1957 . When former West Indian <unk> Learie Constantine wrote about him in 1957 , he noted that St Hill was dead . In 1984 , he was entered into the Trinidad and Tobago Sports Hall of Fame . 
 = = Personality , style and technique = = 
 C. L. R. James described St Hill as " about six feet or a little under , slim , wiry , with forearms like whipcord . His face was bony , with small sharp eyes and a thin , tight mouth . " A reserved man , Hill kept his opinions to himself . Off the cricket field , James described him as partial to the " good things of life " . 
 St Hill was one of the first successful black batsmen in West Indies . As a batsmen , St Hill 's performances reached their highest standards on the biggest occasions and against the best bowlers . Although not possessing quick footwork , he was capable of quickly judging where the ball would land . This enabled him to get into position quickly gave him extra time to play shots , which he often delayed until the ball was very close to him . Many of his runs were hit behind point and square leg . St Hill 's favourite stroke was the leg glance ; the shot carried the risk of falling leg before wicket ( lbw ) if he missed but his placement was very precise . He also played a range of cut shots . If a bowler restricted his scoring , St Hill improvised attacking shots to break free . Learie Constantine wrote a description of an innings he saw St Hill play as a young man . Facing the fast bowling of George John , St Hill " flicked his wrists and the ball flew to the boundary faster than sound . The next went the same way . The boy batted from his wrists ; he never seemed to use any force . I don 't believe he had the strength even if he so desired . His was just perfect timing . " However , he always insisted on playing his own style of game , whether he was in form or not . The result was often his dismissal without scoring many runs . This was the case in England in 1928 . After 1926 , St Hill was never the same batsman and according to James was as likely to get out cheaply as he was to make a big score . 
 St Hill possessed a presence which compelled attention when he was batting . James wrote : " Fires burned in St Hill and you could always see them glow . " When playing for Shannon , he insisted on the highest standards , and even though he was not captain , he would take over if the game was going against his team . James also wrote that he never understood St Hill as he did others : " His eyes used to blaze when he was discussing a point with you ; but even within his clipped sentences there were intervals when he seemed to be thinking of other things , far removed . " 
 St Hill 's batting success was significant for many in cricket . Writer Grant <unk> observed : " In St Hill the masses that watched the game ... saw a vision created in which anger and resentment at the ' pervading humiliation ' they suffered was distilled into a finely tuned batsman . " At the time , black Trinidadians had no democratic outlet for their feelings and opinions . <unk> writes that St Hill 's batting " represented a victory over the forces that held sway over this community 's life in all other walks of life " . St Hill 's many followers in Trinidad identified with his successes and his ability to compete with equality on the cricket field as a sign that they successfully take part in other aspects of life which had been closed to them . 
 = = Beyond a Boundary = = 
 St. Hill is the subject of a chapter in Beyond a Boundary by C. L. R. James , published in 1963 . The book is regarded by many critics as the greatest book on cricket and one of the best books on sport . James wrote : " In my gallery , [ St Hill ] is present with Bradman , Sobers , George Headley and the three Ws , Hutton and Compton , Peter May and a few others . " He describes his character and play , and writes about how much St Hill 's success meant to black Trinidadians as he was " one of us , performing in excelsis in a sphere where competition was open ... Wilton St Hill was our boy . " Reviewing the book in Wisden in 1964 , John Arlott wrote : " The essay on Wilton St Hill must be the finest portrait of a cricketer ever created in prose — or , for that matter in verse or paint either " . 
 James concluded the chapter : " He saw the ball as early as anyone . He played it as late as anyone . His spirit was <unk> , perhaps too much so . There we must leave it . " 
 = Winton Train = 
 The Winton Train was a private passenger train that travelled from the Czech Republic to Great Britain in September 2009 in tribute to the wartime efforts of Sir Nicholas Winton , described as the ' British Schindler ' for his part in saving refugee children from Czechoslovakia . 
 As a result of Sir Nicholas ' efforts in the months leading up to the outbreak of World War II in 1939 , a total of seven locomotives transported 669 Czechoslovak children of mainly Jewish heritage from Prague to safety in Great Britain . 
 Sir Nicholas ' <unk> efforts remained largely unrecognised until 1988 , when they came to public attention after his wife found a scrapbook in their attic documenting the details . Only then did the individuals whom Winton arranged to have transported to safety as children learn the story of how they survived the Holocaust . As the majority of ' Winton 's Children ' ( as they came to be known ) were Jewish , it is believed this saved them from certain death had they stayed in Czechoslovakia . As of 2009 , the direct descendants of Winton 's Children numbered over 5000 people . 
 The 2009 tribute Winston Train carried some of the individuals Sir Nicholas arranged to have transported to safety in 1939 , along with their families , as it retraced the original <unk> route taken by the trains on which they rode as children to safety in Great Britain 70 years earlier . The Winston Train departed on 1 September 2009 , the 70th anniversary of the eighth , and intended last , train arranged by Winston to carry children to safety but was prevented from doing so due to the outbreak of World War II on that very day . It departed from Prague Main railway station , travelled through Germany and the Netherlands . After a transfer by ferry to Harwich , the journey resumed by train again to arrive in London 's Liverpool Street station on 4 September , where it was met by the 100 @-@ year @-@ old Sir Nicholas himself . For the journey across mainland Europe , the train was formed of period carriages and was hauled by historically authentic steam locomotives , while the British leg was hauled by 60163 Tornado , a brand @-@ new , main @-@ line British steam locomotive completed in 2008 , along with carriages that were constructed in the 1950s . 
 The tribute train was the centrepiece of a wider cultural awareness project known as ' Inspiration by Goodness ' , organised by the Czech government .

 Between March and September 1939 , the months leading up to the outbreak of World War II , Nicholas Winton , a 29 @-@ year @-@ old Christian British stockbroker whose parents were of German Jewish descent , organised eight trains to transport mainly Jewish Czech and Slovak refugee children from Czechoslovakia to homes in Britain . The Winton trains were part of a wider British rescue effort from various other countries across Europe , known as the Kindertransports . 
 In 1939 , Winton cancelled a trip to a Swiss holiday resort to go to Prague , having heard of a growing refugee crisis resulting from the German occupation of Czechoslovakia from a friend . His friend was working in the British embassy for the British Committee for Refugees from Czechoslovakia , which was already working to help adults escape from Czechoslovakia . When Winton learned that refugee children could not leave unless accompanied , he decided to arrange their evacuation to Britain . While the Winton evacuations later became known by the collective label of the children 's Kindertransports , which were officially being organised elsewhere in other countries , no official Kindertransports had been arranged in Prague at that time . 
 Winton organised the transfer of the children from the Nazi @-@ appointed Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia to homes in Britain , in the process arranging the necessary bonds and permits for their departure , and finding the families in Britain who would receive the children . Winton and a team identified those children most at risk from the thousands of refugees driven south following the Nazi invasion of the Sudetenland . For each child to be accepted , British officials required a confirmed foster home and a £ 50 guarantee . Winton returned to Great Britain in March to arrange the reception of the children , but his task was hampered by the fact that the domestic evacuation of children was already occurring , and places were hard to find . 
 Beginning in March , Winton organised eight trains , which in total transported 669 mainly Jewish children from Nazi occupied Czechoslovakia to Great Britain . The eighth and final train with 250 children on board was stopped at the last minute , due to the outbreak of the war . Only two children on this ninth aborted train survived the war . According to Channel 4 News reporting on the 2009 Winton Train , " Sir Nicholas has said many times that the vision that haunts him most is the families waiting at Liverpool Street for the train that never arrived " . 
 The original trains left from Prague Wilson railway station ( now Prague Main station ) . While most of the children were met by their new families at London 's Liverpool Street station , some of the children got off the trains at Harwich , where they were placed with local families . Few if any of the Winton children saw their parents again . 
 Winton 's efforts did not come to public light until 1988 , when his wife discovered papers in their loft , whereupon Winton began to publicly talk about his work , and he came to be known as the ' British Schindler ' , in comparison to Oskar Schindler . Sir Nicholas himself believed this was undeserved , because unlike Schindler , his life had never been in danger . 
 = = = Inspiration by Goodness project = = = 
 A project to run a train in tribute to the original Winton trains was announced on 21 January 2008 as the Train Prague – London project , and the organisers were negotiating to have the train named after Sir Nicholas . The train was run by Czech Railways and sponsored by the Czech government , with the project being dedicated to their holding of the Presidency of the Council of the European Union from January to June 2009 . The train was part of a wider project encompassing social and cultural events along the route to " inspire young people through the deeds of Nicholas Winton " , and with the theme of " Inspiration by Goodness " , it incorporated art , film , photographic and literary contests by university students and school children . 
 The project was to follow on from the work of documentary film maker Matej <unk> about Sir Nicholas , including his new film project Nicky 's Family . While travelling on the train , <unk> filmed scenes for a new version of the Winton story . The Czech Senate President <unk> Sobotka said of the project that it " should warn against rising extremism and anti @-@ Semitism in Europe and in the world " .

 The motive power for the train journey was provided by six different steam locomotives in total , two as a double @-@ headed train in the Czech Republic due to the terrain , two in Germany , one in the Netherlands and one in Great Britain . The entire journey was scheduled to take four days , involving a European train leg , a crossing by the passengers on a ferry and an British train leg . It covered a distance of 1 @,@ 296 kilometres ( 805 mi ) , of which 1 @,@ 139 kilometres ( 708 mi ) was the train journey across mainland Europe . 
 On 1 September the train departed Prague Main railway station . On this first day it travelled to the German city of Nuremberg , crossing the Czech - German border at Furth im Wald in the Bavarian Forest . The following day , the train was to travel across Germany to Cologne , via Frankfurt am Main . Instead of Frankfurt however , it travelled via Wiesbaden and the right bank of the River Rhine . On the third day , the train arrived on the North Sea coast at the Dutch ferry port , Hook of Holland , crossing the Dutch - German border at Emmerich am Rhein and passing through the Netherlands via Rotterdam . The passengers disembarked the train to cross the North Sea to Great Britain overnight on the Stena Line ferry Stena Britannica to Harwich , a port in the East of England on the country boundary between Essex and Suffolk . The <unk> train journey formed the fourth day of the journey , travelling from Harwich to the London terminus of Liverpool Street station . 
 On this final day the train departed Harwich International railway station at 09 : <unk> . It travelled via Colchester and Chelmsford , arriving at Liverpool Street station at 10 : 37 on Platform 10 . Platform 10 was the platform number that the original Winton trains had used , although the platform numbers were reconfigured in the 1980s as part of the station 's redevelopment . 
 Sir Nicholas , now 103 years old , met the train at Liverpool Street as guest of honour . On greeting the passengers , Winton said " It 's wonderful to see you all after 70 years ; don 't leave it quite so long until we meet here again . 
 At Liverpool Station all guests and train passengers were conveyed by a fleet of 70 @-@ year @-@ old London buses to the Czech Embassy for the Official Reception . The special transport was organised by the <unk> Organisation on behalf of the Bohemia Transport Muzeum with special help from the London Bus Preservation Trust and the Newman family of Ensign Buses . 
 " Also at Liverpool Street to meet the train was Štefan <unk> , the Czech Minister for European Affairs , and a former Czech ambassador to Britain .

 = Robert Latham Owen = 
 Robert Latham Owen Jr . ( February 2 , 1856 – July 19 , 1947 ) was one of the first two U.S. senators from Oklahoma . He served in the Senate between 1907 and 1925 . 
 Born into affluent circumstances in antebellum Lynchburg , Virginia , the son of a railroad company president , Owen suffered an almost Dickensian reversal of fortune when his family was ruined financially while he was still in his teens . Owen , who was part @-@ Cherokee on his mother 's side , responded by heading west to Indian Territory , where he built a new life as , in turn , a schoolteacher working with Cherokee orphans ; a lawyer , administrator and journalist ; a federal Indian agent ; and the founder and first president of a community bank . Among the achievements that brought him to wider public notice , and helped pave the way for his election to the U.S. Senate in 1907 when Oklahoma ( incorporating the former Indian Territory ) achieved statehood , was his success as a lawyer in 1906 in winning a major court case on behalf of the Eastern Cherokees seeking compensation from the U.S. Government for eastern lands the Cherokees had lost at the time of the Indian removals . 
 A Democrat active in many progressive causes , including efforts to strengthen public control of government , and the fight against child labor , Owen is especially remembered as the Senate sponsor of the Glass @-@ Owen Federal Reserve Act of 1913 , which created the Federal Reserve System . In discussions at the time , he resisted a campaign to put the Federal Reserve formally under the control of the banking industry , and the 1913 Act emerged broadly in line with Owen 's compromise proposal , creating a central Federal Reserve Board nominated by the Government alongside twelve regional Federal Reserve Banks dominated by the larger banks . Owen subsequently became highly critical of what he saw as the Federal Reserve 's bias towards deflationary policies during the early 1920s and again in the early 1930s , which he attributed to excessive influence by the largest banks upon the Fed , and which he identified as largely responsible for causing the Great Depression : a minority view at the time , but one that has , in recent decades , gained wide acceptance among Conservative economists ( having been popularized by Milton Friedman in the 1960s ) . In 1920 Owen unsuccessfully sought the Democratic Party 's nomination for the presidency . 
 Owen 's mother , Narcissa Chisholm Owen ( 1831 – 1911 ) , who did much to foster her son 's career , published a set of memoirs in 1907 about her life lived between Cherokee and mainstream U.S. societies , which have more recently attracted scholarly attention and which were republished in a critical edition in 2005 . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Owen was born in Lynchburg , Virginia on February 2 , 1856 , the younger of two sons of Col. Robert Latham Owen Sr. ( 1825 – 1873 ) , a civil engineer and former surveyor who had become President of the Virginia and Tennessee Railroad , and Narcissa Chisholm Owen . The Owens were a family of Welsh origin , with a record of public service as doctors and teachers : Owen 's grandfather , Dr. William Owen , and Owen 's uncle , Dr. William Otway Owen Sr. ( 1820 – 92 ) , both practised medicine in Lynchburg , and <unk> Owen Sr. served as Surgeon @-@ in @-@ Chief in charge of thirty hospitals in Lynchburg ( which became a major wartime hospital center ) throughout the Civil War . 
 During Owen 's boyhood the family lived in Lynchburg 's best @-@ known mansion , Point of Honor . Owen attended private schools in Lynchburg and in Baltimore , Maryland . Narcissa relates that , not long after the Civil War , her husband resigned his position as President of the Virginia and Tennessee Railway due to his opposition to a proposed railway consolidation , and ran — evidently successfully — for election as a Virginia State Senator . In June 1873 , however , when Owen was 16 , his father died a financially ruined man , and the family fell on hard times . Owen , writing in 1934 , connected their misfortune to the Panic of 1873 , which struck the nation 's railroads especially hard : " the value of my father 's property was completely destroyed , and my mother , from a life of abundance , was suddenly compelled to earn her living by teaching music . " With support from scholarships , initially obtained via his mother 's contacts , but subsequently including the 1876 President 's scholarship , awarded on merit , Owen was able to graduate in 1877 as valedictorian from Washington and Lee University . He also received the University 's gold medal for debating prowess . His older brother , William Otway Owen Jr . ( 1854 – 1924 ) , meanwhile , attended the Virginia Military Institute and the University of Virginia , and went on to a medical career with the US Army , eventually retiring with the rank of Colonel . 
 Owen was Cherokee through his mother , though there are conflicting indications of the extent of his Cherokee ancestry . Owen 's listing on the Dawes Rolls , dating from around 1900 , records him as 1 / 16th Cherokee by blood . Yet his mother , Narcissa Owen , according to her own account in her memoirs ( 1907 ) , would herself appear to have been only 1 / 16th Cherokee , which if correct would imply that her son was 1 / 32nd Cherokee . Beyond this , the editor of Narcissa 's memoirs has raised the possibility that Narcissa might unwittingly have missed out " one generation or possibly two " in her account of her family tree ; adjusting for this possibility might further dilute her Cherokee blood . However this may be , Narcissa had grown up largely among the Cherokees , and she was capable of making skillful use of her Cherokee heritage , colorfully describing her father , Thomas Chisholm ( a leader of the " Old Settlers " who moved west before the Trail of Tears ) , as " the last hereditary war chief of the Western Cherokees . " She also gave both her sons parallel Indian names derived from famous Cherokee chiefs : she named Robert Oconostota after a noted Cherokee chief of the late eighteenth century who was also , according to Narcissa 's Memoirs , her own great great uncle . On the advice of Col. William Penn Adair , a family friend , former Confederate Colonel and a leader among the Cherokees , Owen moved in 1879 to Salina in Indian Territory ( now Salina , Oklahoma ) , where he was accepted as a member of the Cherokee Nation . He served during 1879 @-@ 80 as the principal teacher of the Cherokee Orphan Asylum . His mother joined him in 1880 and taught music for several years at the Cherokee Female Seminary . 
 Owen studied law and was admitted to the bar in 1880 . During 1881 @-@ 84 he served as Secretary of the Board of Education of the Cherokee Nation , and worked on reorganizing the Cherokee school system . In parallel , he served in 1882 , 1883 and 1884 as the President of the International Fair at Muscogee , IT , now Muscogee , Oklahoma ( sometimes billed at the time as " the Indian Capital of the World " ) , the only fair held in Indian Territory at the time . He was owner and editor of the " Indian Chieftain " newspaper , based in present @-@ day Vinita , Oklahoma , in 1884 . In 1885 , with a Democrat in the White House , Owen launched a successful lobbying campaign that saw him appointed as the federal Indian agent for the so @-@ called Five Civilized Tribes , described by one student of his career as " the most important position to be held in Indian Territory " . In the absence of a court system , he promoted the use of compulsory arbitration to settle thousands of civil cases between 1885 and 1889 , when he assisted in the establishment of the first United States Court in Indian Territory . His mother served as his hostess until his marriage on New Year 's Eve , 1889 , to Daisy Deane Hester , with whom he had one daughter , Dorothea , born in 1894 . 
 After the White House again changed hands in 1889 , Owen left government service and organized the First National Bank of Muskogee in 1890 , serving as its president for ten years . He later wrote that the bank 's narrow survival of the Panic of 1893 was to influence his thinking about the need for fundamental reform in the US banking system : 
 This bank , like many other banks , lost fifty percent of its deposits within as many days because of the panic , which frightened people and caused them to withdraw their funds for hoarding throughout the United States and led creditors to strenuously press their debtors for settlement ... This panic demonstrated the complete instability of the financial system of America and the hazards which businessmen had to meet under a grossly defective banking system . 
 As a lawyer and lobbyist , Owen handled a number of significant cases dealing with Indian land issues . Most notably , in 1900 he took on a celebrated case on behalf of the Eastern Cherokees against the US Government , seeking compensation which the Cherokees claimed was due to them under a treaty of 1835 for eastern lands lost at the time of the Indian removals . In 1906 , after six years , Owen won the case and obtained compensation of close to $ 5 million for the Eastern Cherokees . He was also successful in his handling of important cases for the Western Cherokees , Choctaws and Chickasaws . 
 Beyond his obvious drive and ambition , neither his legal nor his political career was to be hampered by Owen 's physical presence . He was a tall man of erect bearing , who kept a full head of hair to the end of his life . One contemporary newspaper profile described him as looking " like a leading man in a society drama . " The New York Times spoke of him on his arrival in the Senate as " the square @-@ jawed , black eyed , lithe young man from the West " and continued that " The Senator 's voice is his most impressive asset . Liquid and soft in quality when he is talking dispassionately , it is as harsh and rasping as a file when he is aroused . " 
 By the time he launched his political career , the combination of Owen 's lucrative legal and lobbying practice , sometimes controversial land deals , and business activities including investments in ranching , mining and oil , had made him a wealthy man . 
 = = Political career = = 
 Owen served as a member of the Democratic National Committee during 1892 @-@ 1896 . He helped promote passage of an act in 1901 to give citizenship to residents of Indian Territory . He subsequently played a leading role in the group that in 1905 organized the Sequoyah Constitutional Convention in pursuit of the admission of Indian Territory to the Union as the State of Sequoyah . Despite receiving overwhelming support in a referendum , the Sequoyah campaign ran — entirely predictably — into the opposition of President Theodore Roosevelt and many in Congress , and Indian Territory was combined with Oklahoma Territory to be admitted into the Union in 1907 as the state of Oklahoma . 
 Owen was active in a number of efforts to increase popular control of government . He was also a consistent supporter of Prohibition ( it was common in late 19th and early 20th century America for supporters of Prohibition also to be supporters of popular control of government , and vice versa ) . He campaigned for women 's suffrage ( though it did not make it into Oklahoma 's original statehood constitution ) . He also worked successfully to place the direct primary , the initiative and referendum , and the recall ( a combination of measures sometimes described as the Oregon System ) in Oklahoma 's state constitution . He was a sometimes outspoken critic of corruption in politics . He was among the organizers of the National Popular Government League , and served as its president from 1913 until 1928 . 
 By the time of statehood and the 1907 elections that accompanied it , local Democrats had managed to harness popular resentment of large corporate trusts to overturn the earlier Republican political dominance of Oklahoma Territory . In the words of a history of Oklahoma politics , " The November elections of 1907 made Oklahoma a Democratic state for half a century to come . " 
 Owen himself first ran in a non @-@ binding primary for US Senator . The Democrats of Indian Territory recommended him to the voters as a " statesman , lawyer , businessman , " and , significantly , " as an Indian . " Owen took first place in the primary and was subsequently officially elected by the legislature as a Democrat to the United States Senate . As two senators were being elected simultaneously , Owen and Thomas Gore , the two men entered a lottery to determine which of them should serve the longer and which the shorter term before needing to run for re @-@ election . Owen won the draw , and hence went on , as a member of the Senate 's Class 2 , to serve a first term of over five years , ending on March 4 , 1913 . 
 Owen was to be re @-@ elected in 1912 , after defeating a serious primary challenge from former Governor Charles Haskell , and again ( without serious challenge ) in 1918 . He served all told from December 11 , 1907 to March 4 , 1925 . Owen reportedly maintained a mailing list of 300 @,@ 000 names . 
 As a newly elected Senator , Owen campaigned actively on behalf of William Jennings Bryan in the presidential election of 1908 ; the two men were to remain political allies for many years . 
 On his arrival in the Senate , Owen became the second Senator at the time with acknowledged Native American ancestry , alongside Republican Senator ( and future Vice @-@ President of the United States ) Charles Curtis of Kansas , whose maternal side was three @-@ quarters ' Native American , of ethnic Kaw , Osage and Pottawatomie ancestry . Curtis was the original author of the 1898 Curtis Act , which dissolved the tribal governments of the five civilized tribes , including the Cherokee , and promoted the allotment of formerly communal tribal lands to individuals , with a view to encouraging the assimilation of Indians into mainstream US society and the market economy ( though the bill was heavily amended in committee , to the point where Curtis himself had reservations about the legislation in its final form ) . ( See also Other issues below ) . 
 Very shortly after Owen was elected to the Senate , his mother published her memoirs ( replete with references to " my son , the United States Senator " ) . Narcissa 's exploration of her own cultural identity as a part @-@ Cherokee woman navigating mainstream US society has recently attracted scholarly attention , and the memoirs were re @-@ published by the University Press of Florida in a critical edition in 2005 . In the words of the editor of the new edition : 
 [ Narcissa ] Owen 's identity becomes fluid in the process of self @-@ representation : both less noble and less savage than the dominant culture has constantly demanded , she is a Cherokee , southerner , Confederate , Christian , friend , family member , teacher , community organizer , tribal translator , socialite , trickster , mother , Indian queen , wife , social activist , healer , painter , storyteller , widow and gardener , to name just a few .

 See also Federal Reserve System , Federal Reserve Act and History of the Federal Reserve System 
 Owen entered the Senate at a time of heightened concern over the volatility of the US financial system , as exemplified by the Panic of 1907 , during which , in the absence of a central bank , J. Pierpont Morgan had felt obliged to intervene personally to lead a rescue of the U.S. financial and banking system . Owen had taken a close personal interest in financial sector issues since his days at the First National Bank of Muscogee . Inter alia , he had traveled to Europe in the summer of 1898 to study the operation of major European central banks , including meeting senior officials at the Bank of England and Germany 's Reichsbank . He made banking issues the subject of a pugnacious maiden speech in the Senate , which — unusually — was interrupted extensively by Senators such as Reed Smoot , Nelson Aldrich and Charles Curtis , who did not appreciate his attack on the power of the larger banks . During his early years in the Senate , Owen proposed a range of financial reforms , including several unsuccessful efforts to institute at the national level a system of insurance for bank deposits parallel to those operated in several states , including — from 1908 onward — Oklahoma ( in the event , federal deposit insurance was not adopted until 1933 ) . 
 The 1912 elections saw the Democrats take control of the White House and the Senate ( they already held the House ) . Owen lobbied successfully for the creation of a new Senate Committee on Banking and Currency , and then became its first Chairman ( a position he was to retain throughout 1913 @-@ 1919 ) . In this capacity , and working with the administration of President Woodrow Wilson , Owen was to be the Senate sponsor of the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 , also known as the Glass @-@ Owen Act , which created the Federal Reserve System . A series of financial panics had convinced many that the United States needed an effective lender of last resort comparable to the central banks found in European countries and other advanced economies . Many , too , saw a need for what was then described as a more " elastic " currency . This concept had multiple dimensions , including : ( i ) a money supply that could respond over time to the development of the real economy , and ( ii ) given that the US economy was still heavily dependent on agricultural production , monetary arrangements able to handle the seasonal bulge in demand for credit as the yearly harvest worked its way through the distribution system , without draining money from the industrial and commercial sectors of the economy . This said , many Americans retained an almost visceral fear of the concept of a central bank as such . 
 Informed debate at the time focused to a significant degree on issues of governance and control . In common with other congressional Progressives , Owen opposed a proposal from Senator Aldrich for a system explicitly controlled by the large banks . Owen countered , in the words of an early biographer , that " the remedy presented in the form of the ' Aldrich Plan of 1912 ' was not satisfactory because it provided for private control of what should be a great public utility banking system . " 
 In the months following his election and subsequent assumption of office , President Wilson held meetings with the authors of three competing proposals for the Federal Reserve : 
 Rep. Carter Glass proposed a decentralized and private sector @-@ dominated system , with a board made up primarily of private bankers , 20 or more regional reserve banks , and with currency a private bank liability . Glass , a southern Democrat with a marked antipathy to centralized power , intended his proposal to be differentiated from the ( similarly private sector @-@ dominated ) Aldrich Plan largely by the absence of a central institution , but to Glass 's horror , Wilson told him to add a central agency ( in Wilson 's own word , a " capstone " ) to his model . 
 U.S. Treasury Secretary William Gibbs McAdoo ( soon to become Wilson 's son @-@ in @-@ law ) proposed the most centralized model , featuring a Government central bank within the Treasury Department , no regional reserve system , and currency a government liability . 
 Owen 's own proposal , drafted with the assistance of the Republican economist ( and former Assistant Secretary of the Treasury ) A. Piatt Andrew , represented something of a middle way between the other two proposals . It included a national currency board appointed by the Government , eight regional reserve banks , and currency as a government liability . Owen 's proposal received support from his Progressive ally , Secretary of State William Jennings Bryan , and the bill that Wilson sent to the Congress was closest to Owen 's model . 
 During the ensuing months of tortuous debate , Owen failed to maintain effective control over his committee , whose deliberations tended to lag behind those of Glass 's committee in the House . At one stage in August 1913 , Owen even wavered publicly in his own support for a regional structure , before being brought back into line by Wilson personally . Owen 's committee eventually split down the middle between Owen 's own version of the bill and a more centralized alternative promoted by Senator Gilbert Hitchcock , a Nebraska Democrat who had become something of a political rival at state level of Owen 's ally Bryan . To break the deadlock , the committee agreed to report out both bills to the full Senate , without a recommendation . Wilson , who had been maintaining a close watch over the legislation 's progress , intervening when he considered it necessary , then ordered the Senate Democrats to meet in caucus to line the party up behind Owen 's bill , making the vote a matter of party loyalty . On December 19 , 1913 , the Senate first defeated Hitchcock 's bill by the narrow margin of 43 @-@ 41 , after which six Republicans joined all the Democrats to endorse Owen 's bill by a more comfortable vote of 54 @-@ 34 . 
 The Federal Reserve Act was signed into law on December 23 , 1913 . As signed , the Act remained closer to Owen 's plan than to any of the alternatives that had been discussed publicly . It provided for greater government involvement than the proposals of Aldrich and Glass , in particular in the appointment of the members of the central Federal Reserve Board , while putting bankers in each region in charge of the twelve ( regional ) Federal Reserve Banks . 
 The 1913 compromise left important issues to be settled after the Federal Reserve System actually began operations , including the exact nature of the relationship between the Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks , and how coordination was to be achieved between the different Federal Reserve Banks . A leading student of the history of the Federal Reserve has described the 1913 compromise as follows : 
 The Federal Reserve began operations ... as a peculiar hybrid , a partly public , partly private institution , intended to be independent of political influence with principal officers of the government on its supervisory board , endowed with central banking functions , but not a central bank . Each of the twelve semiautonomous reserve banks set its own discount rates , subject to the approval of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington , made its own policy decisions , and set its own standards for what was eligible for discounting . 
 Differences of view over the Federal Reserve 's mandate began to become increasingly open in the aftermath of the First World War . In the words of a detailed study of Owen 's role in shaping the Fed : 
 Owen and others viewed price stability and moderate interest rates as key objectives while most other early Fed leaders preferred to focus on maintaining the international gold standard and the strength of the banking system . 
 Owen became critical of what he viewed as the Federal Reserve 's propensity during the early 1920s and again in the early 1930s to follow deflationary monetary policies . Writing in 1934 , he stated that he had attempted in the Senate version of the Federal Reserve Bill to mandate the Federal Reserve to pursue a stable price level ( i.e. , avoiding both significant inflation and deflation ) , but that this provision had been struck out of the House version of the Bill ( managed by Glass ) due to what he described as " secret hostilities " — which he implied originated with the largest banks . He further recalled his opposition at the time to the deflationary policies pursued during 1920 @-@ 21 . 
 Referring to the period from 1929 to 1933 he continued : 
 Again , under President Hoover , the contraction of credit took place on such a colossal scale as to force the dollar index ( purchasing power ) to 166 . The consequence was universal bankruptcy , every bank in the United States being forced to suspend operations at the close of Hoover 's services . 
 Owen 's argument that the Federal Reserve 's deflationary stance was largely responsible for causing the Great Depression would have been considered unorthodox at the time he made it . In more recent decades , however , such a view has come to be widely accepted , due in large part to the influence of the 1963 study A Monetary History of the United States by Milton Friedman and Anna J. Schwartz . 
 Beyond his work on the Federal Reserve Act , Owen helped to pass the Federal Farm Loan Act of 1916 , which provided credit to small farmers through co @-@ operatives . 
 Owen 's role in the creation of the Federal Reserve is commemorated by Robert Latham Owen Park on the grounds of the Federal Reserve in Washington , D.C. ( see photograph ) . 
 = = = Committee chairmanships = = = 
 Owen 's chairmanship of the Committee on Banking and Currency through three Congresses , discussed in the section above , was his most prominent chairmanship by far . His other chairmanships were , by comparison , relatively mundane ( if not obscure ) in nature . 
 Committee on Indian <unk> , Sixty @-@ second Congress ( 1911 – 1913 ) . This committee had the narrow focus of overseeing claims under the Indian <unk> Act , which allowed for citizen claims against the federal government for crimes committed by Native Americans . Together with many other committees by then considered obsolete , the committee was to be wound up in 1921 under a major rationalization . The evidence suggests that Owen assumed the leadership of the committee briefly following the death of the original chairman in November 1912 . 
 Committee on Pacific Railroads , Sixty @-@ second Congress ( 1911 – 1913 ) . This committee was appointed following an investigation into the finances of the Union Pacific Railroad , which was heavily indebted to the United States Government ( it was first established as a select committee in 1889 and became a standing committee in 1893 ) . This committee , too , was to be terminated in 1921 . 
 Committee on Banking and Currency , Sixty @-@ third through Sixty @-@ fifth Congresses ( 1913 – 1919 ) . See Banking issues and formation of the Federal Reserve above . 
 Committee on the Five Civilized Tribes of Indians , Sixty @-@ sixth Congress ( 1919 – 1921 ) . The Five Civilized Tribes is a term that historically was applied to the Cherokee , Chickasaw , Choctaw , Creek , and Seminole . All had a significant presence in Oklahoma . Owen was the last chairman of the committee , which was another of those wound up in 1921 . Owen paid consistent attention throughout his time in the Senate to issues that affected Indian groups ( both these five tribes and others ) , and was actively involved in debates over Indian land rights ( see Other issues below ) and Indian mineral rights cases , as well as disputes over membership in different Indian nations . It is not , however , clear that he made any special use of his chairmanship to promote significant new initiatives . 
 Beyond his chairmanships , Owen 's committee assignments included service inter alia on : ( i ) Banking and Currency after the end of his chairmanship ; ( ii ) Indian Affairs in all but the 64th Congress ; and ( iii ) Appropriations from the 62nd through the 67th Congress . 
 = = = Other issues = = = 
 Although remembered primarily for his role in the establishment of the Federal Reserve , Owen worked on a wide range of other issues during his time in the Senate , many of which either reflected the policy agenda of the Progressive Movement or had a direct bearing on the interests of his constituents . 
 In 1908 , he helped to pass the Removal of Restrictions Act , which lifted then @-@ prevailing restrictions on the sale of many of the individual allotments of Indian land in Oklahoma , an issue on which he had run in 1907 . This extended an earlier process of converting Indian lands from communal to individual ownership . These policies have long been controversial . Critics of converting Indian land from collective to individual tenure ( and removing restrictions on its alienation ) have argued that : ( i ) traditional tribal structures were thereby undermined , and ( ii ) many Indians were induced to part with their land rights on unfavorable terms . Owen countered that the restrictions were paternalistic in spirit , bureaucratically applied , ineffective in their stated goal of protecting Indians from exploitation , and an obstacle to economic development . 
 In common with Woodrow Wilson , Owen was a supporter of lowering tariffs . He made an exception for the oil industry , where he argued that protection was needed for small independent producers , such as those in his state , against the ability of Standard Oil to import large volumes of cheap Mexican oil . Standard Oil was one of several trusts that Owen opposed during the course of his public career . He sought unsuccessfully to strengthen the Sherman Anti @-@ Trust Act . In 1916 , he attacked what he described as the " Lumber Trust , " which he said had bribed members of the Illinois legislature to elect William Lorimer to the Senate in 1909 ( Lorimer 's election had been overturned in 1912 due to evidence of " corrupt methods " including vote @-@ buying ) , and had , Owen said , subsequently retaliated against Owen himself for his role in exposing the Lorimer scandal by funding efforts to defeat his own re @-@ election . Owen made several unsuccessful efforts to mandate effective disclosure of corporate campaign contributions in the interests of open government . He was a supporter of the Sixteenth Amendment , passed by the Congress in 1909 , which allowed the Congress to levy an income tax without apportioning it among the states or basing it on census results ; a federal income tax was required inter alia to make up for the revenues lost to the federal government by reductions in tariff rates . 
 In the Senate , Owen continued his work in support of greater popular control of government . He made repeated attempts , starting in 1907 , to propose a constitutional amendment providing for the direct public election of US Senators , in place of election by state legislatures , until the Senate passed the Seventeenth Amendment to this effect in 1911 . He also continued his strong support for extending the franchise to women ( while opposing an amendment that would have restricted the franchise to whites only ) , until the successful passage in 1919 of the Nineteenth Amendment . He made several unsuccessful attempts to have the initiative and referendum adopted at federal level . He also campaigned unsuccessfully for the election and recall of federal judges , and to prevent federal courts from declaring acts of Congress unconstitutional , a power which , he argued , they had assumed illegally . He was likewise unsuccessful in his efforts to make it easier to amend the Constitution 
 In 1911 , Republicans were blocking the admission of Arizona to statehood , while planning to admit New Mexico . Their declared grounds for opposing statehood for Arizona were that Arizona 's constitution included the initiative , the referendum and the right of recall — the " Oregon System " of enhanced public sovereignty that Owen had long supported . It was , however , also generally expected that Arizona would return two Democrats to the Senate , while New Mexico was expected to favor Republicans . Owen filibustered the Senate for twelve hours until he had forced a Senate vote on the joint admission of both states . During the course of his filibuster , a message was brought to him that , if he would come to the President ( Taft ) , a sincere effort would be made to reach an accommodation over Arizona . Owen responded " Present my compliments to the President , and advise him that at present I am engaged in addressing the Presidents of the United States . " 
 From 1910 onwards , with the encouragement of his brother William , a medical doctor who served for many years with the US Army , Owen campaigned unsuccessfully for the establishment of a cabinet @-@ level Department of Health within the Federal Government . He promoted information on the achievements of Dr. Walter Reed and the Yellow Fever Commission , in part to demonstrate the potential of systematically @-@ organized programs in the field of public health . His efforts to create a cabinet @-@ level Department of Education , initiated in 1917 , similarly failed to achieve success during his own lifetime . A combined Department of Health , Education and Welfare was eventually added to the cabinet under President Eisenhower in April 1953 . 
 Owen was actively involved in efforts to outlaw child labor . He served as co @-@ sponsor of the Keating @-@ Owen Act of 1916 , aimed at prohibiting the sale in interstate commerce of goods manufactured with child labor in the United States . In 1918 , the Act was struck down as unconstitutional by a five @-@ to @-@ four decision of the Supreme Court in Hammer v. <unk> , evincing a noted dissent by Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes . Following the Court 's decision , Owen initially made an unsuccessful attempt to pass the legislation again with limited modification . In the event , the Congress responded to the Court 's decision with the Child Labor Tax Law of 1919 , which would have taxed products from child labor ( and which in turn was declared unconstitutional in 1922 by an 8 to 1 vote in Bailey v. Drexel Furniture Co . ) . In 1924 , the Congress sought to amend the Constitution to give itself the power to regulate child labor . Finally , in 1941 , after Owen 's retirement from active political life , a unanimous Supreme Court in United States v. Darby Lumber Co. overruled the 1918 decision ( in the process endorsing and going beyond the principles set forth in Holmes 's dissent ) and ruled that the Commerce Clause gave Congress the right to regulate conditions of employment . 
 Owen was a close ally of President Wilson over American involvement in World War I. In 1920 he withheld his support from the campaign for renomination of his fellow @-@ Democratic Senator from Oklahoma , Thomas Gore , over Gore 's repeated criticisms of Wilson 's positions on the war and the peace . Gore was then defeated in the Democratic primary by Rep. Scott Ferris , who , however , went on to lose in the general election to Republican John W. <unk> ( Gore eventually returned to the Senate following re @-@ election in 1930 ) . 
 Owen worked unsuccessfully after the war to salvage Wilson 's hopes for US participation in the League of Nations . In January 1920 , at a time when the ailing Wilson himself refused to countenance any US reservations to the League 's Covenant , and the influential Republican Senator Henry Cabot Lodge refused to accept membership without reservations , Owen issued a call for bipartisan compromise . A small group from both parties ( including Lodge ) then made substantial progress towards agreement , against Wilson 's intense opposition . However , when the " irreconcilable " anti @-@ League Senator William Borah learnt of the bipartisan discussions , he pressured Lodge into pulling out . 
 Owen was concerned about the prospects for international economic recovery after the war . In November 1919 , he wrote to Wilson warning that the gold standard had temporarily broken down , and urging the President to convene an International Exchange Conference to address the problem ; he also emphasized the importance , in the post @-@ war period , of the United States helping the European countries to obtain credit via the marketing of their securities . Owen made unsuccessful attempts in the early post @-@ war years to promote the establishment of a Foreign Finance Corporation ( and / or a Federal Reserve Foreign Bank ) to help expand credit for international trade . 
 = = = Campaign for Presidency and final years in politics = = = 
 Owen launched a run for the Presidency in Oklahoma on May 19 , 1919 , and undertook a tour of several states , seeking support , in the spring of 1920 . He published a number of books during this period , publicizing his involvement in the passage of the Federal Reserve Act and his views on a variety of economic and foreign policy issues ( see Works by Robert Latham Owen below ) . Owen received some indications of support from his fellow @-@ Progressive and long @-@ time ally , the party 's three @-@ time standard @-@ bearer William Jennings Bryan , who joined him on his campaign visits to some of the Western states , but Bryan 's support for Owen was lukewarm , his influence in the party was past his peak , and he placed much of his focus in 1920 on promoting the cause of prohibition , the main theme of his eventual speech at the convention . Bryan declined to run for the nomination himself for multiple reasons — his health was problematic ( he described himself to one journalist as " at the end of life " ) and he expected the Democrats to go down to defeat — though he privately left open the possibility of accepting the nomination in exceptional circumstances . Owen , for his part , gained few significant endorsements . 
 By the time of the 1920 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco , whatever Owen 's own ambitions , his candidacy had a " favorite son " appearance to it . He received 33 votes on the first ballot , which increased to 41 on the twentieth ballot . His support came primarily from his own state , together with some votes from Nebraska ( Bryan 's adopted state ) . On the fortieth ballot he again received 33 votes , putting him in fourth place . The Oklahoma delegates remained loyal until on the forty @-@ fourth ballot Owen released them so as to ensure a unanimous vote for the Party 's nominee Governor of Ohio James M. Cox . The chronicler of Owen 's senatorial career relates that " efforts to secure Owen 's consent to accept the nomination for vice @-@ president failed , " but any such efforts do not appear to have originated with the Party 's nominee , who was decisive in his preference for Franklin Delano Roosevelt as his running mate . The Cox @-@ Roosevelt slate went down to defeat by a landslide . 
 Owen 's later views on international affairs did not escape controversy . Though initially a firm supporter of the Treaty of Versailles , including its assertion of German responsibility for the outbreak of World War I , during 1923 his views changed radically under the influence of " revisionist " studies , including the publication of extensive ( though incomplete ) materials from the diplomatic archives of the pre @-@ War Tsarist Russian Foreign Office . He made a major speech in the Senate on 18 December 1923 attributing primary responsibility for the war to France and ( especially ) Russia rather than Germany . Owen hoped that a public revisiting of the issue of war guilt might encourage reversal of some of the penal clauses imposed on Germany under the Versailles settlement , and pave the way to reconciliation between Germany and France , but his attempts to promote a Senate investigation of the war guilt question were narrowly defeated , largely along party lines — with many of his fellow Democrats concerned not to undermine the reputation of Woodrow Wilson — while an expert report prepared by the Legislative Research Service of the Library of Congress , though broadly supportive of Owen 's arguments , was in the event never published as it was considered unlikely to obtain the support of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee . In 1926 , following his retirement from the Senate , Owen was to publish a book advancing his revisionist thesis , under the title : The Russian Imperial Conspiracy , 1892 @-@ 1914 : The Most Gigantic Intrigue of all Time . 
 Owen wrote of the convictions underlying his efforts on the war guilt issue : 
 The Germans did not will the war . It was forced on them by the Russian Imperialists ... The German , Russian , French , Belgian and allied peoples became alike the sorrowful victims ... The happiness and future peace of the world require the reconciliation of the German and French people . 
 This said , some have seen Owen 's preoccupation with the war guilt question as , at least to some degree , symptomatic of a growing detachment on his part from current U.S. political issues following the Democrats ' loss of the 1920 elections . On the domestic front , the Harding administration 's " return to normalcy " offered little scope for further advances on Owen 's Progressive agenda ; in international affairs , the post @-@ 1920 turn of US policy towards isolationism and protectionism also ran counter to his long @-@ held principles . 
 In February 1924 , Owen announced that he would not run for re @-@ election , and on March 4 , 1925 , at the age of 69 , he retired from the Senate . Owen did not campaign for the presidency in 1924 , though when the Democratic Convention of that year reached its hundredth indecisive ballot , some 20 delegates cast their votes for him . 
 A leading student of Owen 's political career sums up his overall assessment as follows : 
 If Owen failed to live up to the expectations of his own ambition , he was in any case an industrious and productive United States senator of the first order . 
 = = Later life and death = = 
 On Owen 's retirement , the Democratic Party failed to retain his seat in the Senate . This reflected a split in the party over the candidacy of former Oklahoma Governor Jack C. Walton , who had been impeached and removed from office as Governor in November 1923 , over accusations ( inter alia ) that he had acted unconstitutionally in suspending habeas corpus in the face of race riots fanned by the Ku Klux Klan . Although Walton won the nomination , largely on an anti @-@ Klan platform , many local Democratic leaders , including Owen , declined to support his candidacy , and the seat was won in a landslide by the Republican candidate , William B. Pine . The seat reverted to Democratic control in 1930 when Thomas Gore was re @-@ elected to the Senate . 
 After his retirement from the Senate , Owen initially practiced law and undertook lobbying in Washington , D.C .. In 1923 , he formally adopted his only grandchild , who took the name Robert Latham Owen III . In the 1928 Presidential election , Owen felt unable to support his party 's nominee Al Smith , due to Smith 's strong anti @-@ prohibition position and his connections to Tammany Hall ; to his subsequent deep regret , he became the first prominent Democrat to endorse the candidacy of Republican Herbert Hoover . He returned to the Democratic fold in 1932 to give a strong endorsement to Franklin Delano Roosevelt . 
 In retirement , Owen worked on a personal proposal to develop and promote a universal alphabet based on phonetic principles . He was inducted into the Oklahoma Hall of Fame in 1941 . In his later years Owen was functionally blind . His wife predeceased him in 1946 , and he died in Washington of complications from prostate surgery on July 19 , 1947 . He was buried in Spring Hill Cemetery , Lynchburg , Virginia , near his beloved mother and other family members . Carter Glass , his fellow sponsor of the Glass @-@ Owen Federal Reserve Act , with whom Owen had experienced a frequently strained relationship , lies nearby .

 Darryl Philbin ( Craig Robinson ) is off to Philadelphia to interview at Jim Halpert 's ( John Krasinski ) new company , Athlead , and Pam Halpert ( Jenna Fischer ) decides to come along , since office manager Andy Bernard ( Ed Helms ) is still not back from his sailboat excursion . She asks Erin Hannon ( Ellie Kemper ) to take care of a shipment of pens while she 's gone . Pam 's lack of specific instructions leaves Erin in a state of indecision over whether she should put the pens away once they arrive . She eventually decides to put them away for fear of being called lazy , but as she does so the other office workers teasingly accuse her of trying to take over Pam 's job of office administrator in her absence . Mortified , Erin puts the pens back in the shipping box . 
 On the drive , Darryl opens to Pam that he is worried about the interview . At Jim 's new company , Pam gives Darryl a thumbs up as he heads into the interview room , and then is chatted up by an employee who says " Jim speaks about you all the time " and we " can 't wait for you to move here . " The thought of moving to Philadelphia disturbs her . Meanwhile , Darryl initially fumbles his interview due to nerves and feelings of inadequacy , but everyone else helps calm him down , and he makes a strong reversal . Darryl concludes the interview by attempting to shoot a basket with the room 's sports decorations , but instead knocks a light fixture into the fish tank , electrocuting all the fish . Pam <unk> with Darryl over this embarrassing misstep . Jim returns to inform Darryl that although he will have to pay for the fish , he has the job . During the drive home , Darryl gushes over his new job and the chance to live in Philadelphia while Pam worries about where she and her family will be in the future . 
 At Dunder @-@ Mifflin , Clark ( Clark Duke ) returns from his stint as Jan Levenson 's ( Melora Hardin ) sexual assistant . Despite the awkward past couple of weeks , Jan has gifted them an espresso machine , and the rest of the office jumps on the opportunity to ' test ' out several espresso flavors . Dwight Schrute ( Rainn Wilson ) enlists Clark 's help to snag a newly freed account at a suit warehouse ; the two will pose as a father and son so that they can successfully sell to the Stones , father and son owners of the warehouse . Dwight leads off on how proud he is of Clark to elder Stone ( Ed Lauter ) , but when Stone admits that he and his son are not on good terms , Dwight and Clark awkwardly shift gears and begin a show of childishly sniping at each other . Clark tries to move on to business , but Dwight continues to interrupt him with insults , and even makes a dig at the younger Stone ( Will Greenberg ) when he arrives . When the elder Stone reveals that his son has forced him out of the company and that he is now there strictly for his own social benefit , Clark takes the lead and makes the sale to the younger Stone . Both Dwight and Clark also buy a suit from the company to celebrate their team sale . 
 Back at the office , the staff have drunk multiple cups of espresso and experience a caffeine rush along with a powerful surge in office productivity . As the rush dies down , they all begin to sweat profusely , become highly irritable and argumentative , frantically tear up the office carpet to reveal the hardwood underneath , and try to relocate the copy machine . At five o 'clock everybody leaves the office in total disarray . When Pam and Darryl arrive back from Philadelphia , they are bewildered by the sight they encounter .

 IGN writer Cindy White criticized the espresso subplot and the episode in general , for the lack of authority in the office , due to Jim , Andy and Pam leaving the office . She also called the plot too similar to the season five episode , " Cafe Disco " .

 = Typhoon Gordon ( 1989 ) = 
 Typhoon Gordon , known in the Philippines as Typhoon Goring , was a powerful tropical cyclone that caused widespread damage and loss of life in the Philippines and Southern China in July 1989 . Originating from a single cumulonimbus cloud on July 9 , Gordon developed into a tropical depression near the Northern Mariana Islands and quickly intensified as it tracked west @-@ southwestward . On July 13 , the storm attained typhoon status and subsequently underwent a period of rapid intensification . By July 15 , the storm attained its peak strength as a Category 5 equivalent super typhoon with winds estimated at 260 km / h ( 160 mph ) . After striking the northern Philippines , Gordon moved through the South China Sea and slowly weakened . On July 18 , the storm made landfall in southern China and was last noted the following day as it dissipated over land . 
 Throughout Gordon 's path from the Philippines to China , the storm caused widespread damage and loss of life . Across the Philippines , 90 people were killed by the typhoon and an estimated 120 @,@ 000 people were left homeless . Though a weaker storm when it struck China , damage was more severe due to extensive flooding . Several coastal cities were completely inundated . Throughout the country , at least 200 people died and losses reached 1 @.@ 2 billion yuan ( $ 319 million USD ) . Additionally , 14 people drowned offshore and 2 others died in Hong Kong .

 In early July , widespread showers and thunderstorms developed across the Western Pacific underneath a tropical upper tropospheric trough ( TUTT ) . On July 9 , a single cumulonimbus cloud west of Wake Island became associated with the TUTT and quickly organized . By July 11 , the system featured a small central dense overcast and soon became sufficiently organized for the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) to declare it as Tropical Depression 11W . Upon classification , the system was located roughly 320 km ( 200 mi ) east of the Northern Mariana Islands . The development of the depression was unprecedented in two ways : first , a single cloud developed into a tropical cyclone ; and second , it became tropical while situated underneath a cold @-@ core low . 
 Following the system 's classification as a tropical cyclone , the depression maintained a west @-@ southwesterly track in response to a subtropical ridge to the north . On July 12 , it is estimated that the depression intensified into a tropical storm , at which time it was given the name Gordon by the JTWC . Due to the cyclone 's proximity to the Philippines , the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration also monitored the storm and assigned it with the local name Goring . During the afternoon of July 13 , Gordon briefly turned southwestward as it attained typhoon status before returning to a more westerly track later that day . 
 As the TUTT gradually warmed , Gordon was able to undergo a prolonged period of rapid intensification , despite having restricted outflow . Over a 30 hour period from July 14 to 15 , the storm 's central pressure decreased by 70 mbar ( hPa ; 2 @.@ 07 inHg ) , just below the threshold for explosive intensification . At the end of this phase , Gordon attained its peak strength as a Category 5 equivalent super typhoon with winds estimated at 260 km / h ( 160 mph ) . Around the same time , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) assessed the storm to have attained 10 @-@ minute sustained winds of 185 km / h ( 115 mph ) along with a minimum pressure of 915 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 02 inHg ) . 
 Once classified a super typhoon , Gordon acquired a slight northerly component to its track and maintained a general west @-@ northwestward trajectory for the remainder of its existence . Late on July 15 , Gordon made landfall in northern Luzon , Philippines , at peak intensity . Remaining over land for several hours , the storm quickly weakened before entering the South China Sea . The system maintained minimal typhoon status as it developed a large , ragged eye by July 17 . Slight weakening took place hours before Gordon made landfall as a strong tropical storm near Zhanjiang in Southern China on July 18 . Briefly moving over the warm , shallow waters of the Gulf of Tonkin , Gordon 's convective structure tripled in size ; however , the system continued to weaken . Later that day , the storm made its final landfall in southern Guangxi Province . Once onshore , Gordon quickly weakened and was last noted on July 19 by the JMA over southern Guangxi .

 After going undrafted in the 1994 NFL Draft , Elias signed with the Giants . The 1994 NFL season was the first year that rosters expanded to 53 , and Elias made the roster out of training camp . He made the roster ahead of 1994 third round draft choice running back Gary Downs . That season he was originally assigned the number 25 , but he eventually took the number 20 . On September 11 , 1994 against the Arizona Cardinals , Elias sprained his ankle . The injury hampered him for several weeks . After two games of special team duties , he spent the remainder of the season on the inactive list . Following the season , he was left unprotected in the 1995 NFL Expansion Draft to stock the Carolina Panthers and Jacksonville Jaguars . When the Giants lost the second of their unprotected players in the draft they made Elias unavailable . 
 Entering the 1995 NFL season , Elias was not expected to make the 1995 team . However , in the first preseason game , he scored the Giants ' only touchdown , and the next week he ran for 77 yards on just 12 carries ; After two preseason games , he led the Giants roster of running backs that included Rodney Hampton , Herschel Walker , Kenyon Rasheed , Downs , Charles Way , and Tyrone Wheatley in rushing with 123 yards . The following week he blocked a punt that the Giants recovered for a touchdown and scored the winning two @-@ point conversion . After three preseason games , Elias had moved from likely to be released to almost a lock to make the team . Elias finished the preseason as the team 's leading rusher with 214 yards on 37 carries and made the team . Elias again contributed on special teams , but in the first ten games , he only had ten yards on four carries . Late in the season , Elias moved into the role of the first man off the bench to spell Hampton who was the starter in place of Wheatley who had held the role early in the season . He finished the season with 10 rushes for 44 yards and 9 receptions for 69 yards . Following the season , the Giants opted to release Walker and expected to be unable to resign Hampton . That season , Elias ' popularity made him one of the most sought after public speakers on the team and earned him nearly $ 50 @,@ 000 ( $ 77 @,@ 648 ) . 
 Elias entered the 1996 NFL season as the likely third down back for the 1996 team . In 1995 no one had emerged to replace Dave Meggett in that role . Elias again had strong preseason performances . In one early August exhibition game he scored two touchdowns . By August 22 , he led the Giants in preseason carries . He entered the season as the first option third down back , ahead of Wheatley . In the September 30 contest against the Minnesota Vikings , John Randle picked fights with some of the Giants , including Elias . Elias suffered turf toe in that game and it affected him in the next as well . He also had an October ankle injury , which consisted of both a sprain and a bone chip . That injury kept him out of the lineup , making Wheatley the third down back by default . Elias did not get his third down role back until mid @-@ November . When he finally returned to this role , he was able to perform as needed . However , he was soon suffering from a torn posterior cruciate ligament and a damaged meniscus in need of surgery and was lost for the season . He had immediate November surgery , which revealed that the ligament was 90 % torn , but would heal on its own . It kept him out of the lineup for the rest of the season , however . He finished the season on injured reserve . During the offseason , he got involved as a narrator for the Westchester Philharmonic . As the Giants prepared for the 1997 NFL Draft they attempted to resign Elias . 
 In 1997 , he earned the Unsung hero award from the New York Giants . Elias did not play for the Giants during the 1997 NFL season , and he did not sign with the Indianapolis Colts until the 1998 NFL season . He had an offer from the 1997 Carolina Panthers , but he tested the market too long and lost it . He spent 1997 coaching his high school alma mater 's football team where his brother , Greg , was playing . He was the running backs and special teams coach . After three seasons with the Giants he served as special teams captain with the Indianapolis Colts . He also served as the backup to Marshall Faulk and Edgerrin James . The Colts resigned him to a second one @-@ year contract for the 1999 NFL season . He scored the game @-@ winning touchdown in the final preseason game on September 2 . Following the season he was arrested on charges of disorderly conduct and resisting arrest at a barroom brawl in Seaside Heights , New Jersey . His 20 @-@ year @-@ old brothers Brian and Gregory as well as New York Jets wide receiver Wayne Chrebet were also arrested . Elias jumped on a police officer who was attempting to handcuff one of his brothers . According to The New York Times Brian Elias was engaged to Jennifer Chrebet , Wayne 's sister , but the New York Daily News reported that they were married . When the case was heard in court , the three Elias brothers and Chrebet all pleaded guilty to a public nuisance violation and paid fines of $ 230 apiece . Chrebet pleaded guilty in absentia via a legal representative . After playing two years for the Colts on special teams , while rushing for 52 yards on 21 carries , Elias ' veteran salary would not fit under the salary cap for the 2000 team . Thus , Elias did not play in the NFL during the 2000 NFL season . 
 In November 2000 , Elias attended the minicamp of the New York / New Jersey Hitmen of the XFL who were scheduled to begin play the following February . He hoped to survive roster cuts as the team went from 70 men to a 38 @-@ man roster . Elias made the team as a backup running back . In the early season games , he saw plenty of action as a ball carrier , even though he was struggling with a knee injury . However , in March , he was placed on injured reserve . Elias hasn 't participated in a season since and during the season Elias prepared for life after football by writing screenplays .

Steam for the turbines was provided by three Admiralty 3 @-@ drum water @-@ tube boilers . Hereward carried a maximum of 470 long tons ( 480 t ) of fuel oil that gave her a range of 5 @,@ 530 nautical miles ( 10 @,@ 240 km ; 6 @,@ 360 mi ) at 15 knots ( 28 km / h ; 17 mph ) . The ship 's complement was 137 officers and men in peacetime , but this increased to 146 in wartime . 
 The ship mounted four 45 @-@ calibre 4 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 120 mm ) Mk IX guns in single mounts . For anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) defence , Hereward had two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0 @.@ 5 inch Vickers Mk III machine gun . She was fitted with two above @-@ water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21 @-@ inch torpedoes . One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted ; 20 depth charges were originally carried , but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began . Beginning in mid @-@ 1940 , the ship 's anti @-@ aircraft armament was increased , although when exactly the modifications were made is not known . The rear set of torpedo tubes was replaced by a 12 @-@ pounder AA gun .

 The ship was laid down by the High Walker Yard of Vickers Armstrong at Newcastle @-@ on @-@ Tyne on 28 February 1935 , launched on 10 March 1936 and completed on 9 December 1936 . Excluding government @-@ furnished equipment like the armament , the ship cost £ 249 @,@ 591 . She tested the twin @-@ gun mounted intended for use on the Tribal @-@ class destroyers in January – March 1937 at Gibraltar . It was removed at the end of the trials and her two forward guns were replaced immediately afterwards . The ship was then assigned to the 2nd Destroyer Flotilla of the Mediterranean Fleet and began patrolling Spanish waters in the Mediterranean enforcing the Non @-@ Intervention Agreement during the Spanish Civil War . Hereward was refitted in Malta from 30 September to 30 October 1937 and again a year later , this time in Portsmouth Dockyard in June – July 1939 and she returned to the Mediterranean afterwards . 
 Hereward was transferred to Freetown to hunt for German commerce raiders in the South Atlantic with Force K in October . The ship and her sisters , Hardy , Hasty , and Hostile , rendezvoused with the battlecruiser Renown , the aircraft carrier Ark Royal , and the light cruiser Neptune on 17 December . They refueled in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil , before proceeding to the estuary of the River Plate in case the damaged German pocket battleship Admiral Graf Spee attempted to escape from Montevideo , Uruguay , where she had taken refuge after losing the Battle of the River Plate . Hereward captured the German blockade runner <unk> on 5 November . The ship was based at Trinidad from 20 November to 23 January 1940 and blockaded the German merchant ship <unk> in Port Everglades , Florida whilst based there . She escorted the battleship Valiant to Halifax , but suffered weather damage en route that required three weeks for repairs . Hereward then escorted the light cruiser Orion to the UK as the latter carried the ashes of John Buchan , Governor General of Canada , home . She required further repairs at Portsmouth upon arrival and missed the Battles of Narvik in April . 
 Hereward escorted ships into Scheveningen , Netherlands on 11 May to evacuate British citizens after the Germans invaded the previous day . She evacuated Queen Wilhelmina and her family from the Netherlands on 13 May , and was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet a few days later . The ship arrived at Alexandria on 24 May and began escorting convoys and larger ships of the fleet . Hereward participated in the Battle of Calabria in July 1940 , where she was hit by splinters from a near @-@ miss of the Italian battleship Giulio Cesare . The ship escorted a convoy during Operation Collar and then fired at retreating Italians in Cyrenaica after the Battle of Sidi Barrani . Together with her sister Hyperion , she sank the Italian submarine <unk> on 13 December . Hereward escorted the battleships of the Mediterranean Fleet as they bombarded Valona on 19 December and then sortied into the North Atlantic when Convoy WS @-@ 5A reported that it had been attacked by the German cruiser Admiral Hipper on 25 December . She escorted three of the convoy 's ship to Gibraltar on 29 December . 
 The ship participated in Operation Excess in early January 1941 and sank the Italian torpedo boat Vega on 10 January with a torpedo in the Strait of Sicily . Together with the destroyer Decoy and the gunboat Ladybird , Hereward landed commandos on the island of Kastelorizo as part of Operation Abstention , but they were overwhelmed by an Italian counter @-@ attack . Only a few survivors were taken off two days later . The ship participated in the Battle of Cape Matapan in early March 1941 and the evacuation of Greece in April 1941 . She sank a number of fishing boats transporting German troops to Crete on 21 May and helped evacuate the Allied garrison of Heraklion on 29 May . Later that day she was attacked by German Junkers Ju 87 " Stuka " dive bombers and hit by one bomb just in front of her forward funnel . She turned towards the nearby coast of Crete , but was sunk by further attacks . Four officers and 72 crewmen were killed , but the 89 survivors were rescued by Italian MAS torpedo boats and taken prisoner .

 The 1991 Sierra Madre earthquake occurred on June 28 at 07 : 43 : 55 local time with a moment magnitude of 5 @.@ 6 and a maximum Mercalli intensity of VII ( Very Strong ) . The thrust earthquake resulted in two deaths , around 100 injuries , and damage estimated at $ 33 @.@ 5 – 40 million . The event occurred beneath the San Gabriel Mountains on the Clamshell – Sawpit Fault , which is a part of the Sierra Madre – Cucamonga Fault System . Instruments captured the event at a number of strong motion stations in Southern California , including the two largest aftershocks ( both 4 @.@ 0 local magnitude ) that occurred on June 28 and on July 6 .

 Due to its history of generating great earthquakes ( 1857 , 1906 ) the focal point of earthquake hazard assessment in California has been the strike @-@ slip San Andreas System of faults . However , a system of faults , including the Sierra Madre – Cucamonga Fault System that runs along the border of the San Gabriel and San Fernando Valleys , has also caused a series of moderate to large events in the Greater Los Angeles Area . The westernmost portion of this fault system ruptured in 1971 and has been identified as one of six major fault systems that pose a threat to the highly populated region . 
 Geodetic research has shown that crustal shortening is occurring in the region of the Transverse Ranges at a rate of 0 @.@ 33 inches ( 8 @.@ 5 mm ) per year . Although a number of earthquakes have occurred in the Los Angeles area since 1971 , the rate of moderate events since then may not be typical , and few large events have occurred since records have been kept . The rate of contraction and too few moderate events that have occurred indicated to researchers that a deficit of seismic energy release exists , and that larger , but less frequent events may also contribute to the release of strain accumulation . 
 = = Tectonic setting = = 
 To the west of the San Andreas Fault , the southern edge of the Transverse Ranges has been in a state of contraction during the Quaternary Period , with active reverse faulting that has uplifted San Gabriel Mountains . The west @-@ striking ( and range @-@ bounding ) Sierra Madre – Cucamonga Faults , as well as the San Cayetano Fault and Santa Susana Faults all exhibit a component of left @-@ lateral strike @-@ slip motion and share a similar trend . 
 The Malibu Coast – Santa Monica Fault lies at the southern flank of the Santa Monica Mountains and the Raymond Fault runs to the south of the Verdugo Mountains and meets the San Gabriel Mountains at Monrovia . The Clamshell – Sawpit Fault lies beneath the San Gabriel Mountains inline with the Raymond Fault . The characteristics of the various faults are difficult to interpret , but they all dip steeply to the north with several thousand feet of displacement .
