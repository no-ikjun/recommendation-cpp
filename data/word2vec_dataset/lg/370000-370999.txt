 Greg Kot of The Chicago Tribune noted that Rihanna assumes the role of playing the victim in the song , and not the offender , saying " She 's wary of men even when she ’ s flirting with them in ' Wait Your Turn ' . " Prior to Greenblatt 's album review of Rated R , where she briefly commented on " Wait Your Turn " , she also reviewed the song when it leaked onto the Internet in early November , saying " Now that the wait is nearly ova , are you feeling it , Music Mixers ? I cannot tell a lie ; I ’ m a little underwhelmed by this new walk @-@ the @-@ plank Pirate incarnation . " William Goodman of Spin magazine was more critical and dismissive of the song , saying " ' Wait Your Turn ' ... leaked online over the weekend , and like the album 's lead track , ' Russian Roulette , ' it 's a total let down : clunky , Auto @-@ Tuned vocals repeat ' The wait is ova / The wait is ova ' ad nauseam , over dark atmospherics and a spare dub beat that fails to connect ... it 's certainly not worth the wait . "

 The music video for " Wait Your Turn " was filmed on October 16 , 2009 in New York City and was directed by Anthony Mandler , who had previously directed the majority of Rihanna 's music videos , including " Take a Bow " and " Rehab " . Music video was edited by Nabil Mechi from Murex , who previously edit videos for " S.O.S. " and " Umbrella " . The music video made its premiere on November 9 , 2009 . In an interview with MTV News , Mandler spoke of the conceptualization of the video as well as the inspiration behind it : 
 We shot the clip in mid @-@ October on a cold day in New York City . The vibe and feeling was great ... It was the first video for the album , so obviously everyone was excited and focused on setting the tone for what 's to come . Rihanna and I spoke in depth about creating a piece that was gritty , raw and more of a street video then a classic beauty piece ... We loved the energy and bravado of early hip @-@ hop videos that were made without a lot of resources , working more with the textures and shapes of the surroundings , then trying to build and manipulate environments as we have done in the past ... I wanted to try and take everything we have done in the past and put it to the side . 
 It starts with a series of shots displaying Rihanna wearing a black eye @-@ patch , a high @-@ necked jacket and suspenders , and was filmed in a black and white grainy fashion , whilst Rihanna recites the lyrics " The wait is ova " . Scenes are then intercut with shots of Rihanna wearing a black hooded top , in what appears to be a Church , which is followed by Rihanna changing outfits , again wearing a black bra top and a fur coat sitting on a pair of Angel 's wings for the chorus . For the bridge of the song , Rihanna is featured in yet another change of outfit , this time wearing a white vest top and black fur coat , standing on the roof top of a New York skyscraper , with other tall buildings in the background . As Rihanna sings the final chorus , scenes from throughout the video are intercut with each other , with the new addition of Rihanna shown to be wearing what she wore at the start of the video in an underpass .

In his review of the performance , Gil Kaufman of MTV commented on the main aspects of the spectacle , commenting that she was wearing a " skintight white catsuit bisected by cut @-@ out lines that revealed horizontal lines of skin across her body , spiked shoulder pads , white studded cuffs and a barbed @-@ wire bracelet snaking up her right forearm . " The performance started with a sci @-@ fi themed video clip , which featured Rihanna being operated on by robots .

 = Kevin Youkilis = 
 Kevin Edmund Youkilis ( / <unk> / ; born March 15 , 1979 ) , also known as " Youk " / <unk> / , is an American former professional baseball first baseman and third baseman . A native of Cincinnati , Ohio , he was drafted by the Boston Red Sox in 2001 , after playing college baseball at the University of Cincinnati . He played in Major League Baseball ( MLB ) for the Red Sox , the Chicago White Sox , and the New York Yankees . He is currently a special assistant to the Chicago Cubs and former Red Sox GM Theo Epstein . 
 Known for his ability to get on base , while he was still a minor leaguer , Youkilis was nicknamed <unk> : The Greek God of Walks in the best @-@ selling book , Moneyball : The Art of Winning an Unfair Game . A Gold Glove Award @-@ winning first baseman , he once held baseball 's record for most consecutive errorless games at first base ( later broken by Casey Kotchman ) . He is also a three @-@ time MLB All @-@ Star , two @-@ time World Series Champion , and winner of the 2008 Hank Aaron Award . 
 An intense performer on the playing field , Youkilis was known for his <unk> , grittiness , dirt @-@ stained jerseys , home @-@ plate collisions , and his strange batting stance . He excelled despite a physique that led many observers to underestimate his athletic ability . He was called " <unk> @-@ poly " by his high school coach , " pudgy " by his college coach , a " fat kid " by general manager Billy Beane , and a " thicker @-@ bodied guy " by the Red Sox scout who recruited him . As Jackie MacMullan wrote for the Boston Globe : " He does not look like an MVP candidate ; more a refrigerator repairman , a butcher , the man selling hammers behind the counter at the True Value hardware store . " Youkilis was named to the Sporting News ' list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball , ranking No. 36 on the list in 2009 , No. 38 in 2010 , and No. 35 in 2011 . 
 = = Background and early life = = 
 Youkilis ' Jewish great @-@ great @-@ great @-@ grandfather , a native of 19th @-@ century Romania , moved to Greece at the age of 16 to avoid conscription at the hands of the notoriously anti @-@ Semitic Cossacks . He became homesick , however , and returned to Romania after a couple of years , although he changed his surname from " Weiner " to " Youkilis " to avoid army and jail . 
 Youkilis was born in Cincinnati , the son of Carolyn ( née <unk> ) and Mike Youkilis , a wholesale jeweler . His father was born to a Jewish family , while his mother , a native of West Virginia , converted to Judaism after her marriage . Youkilis has described his father as a " well @-@ known third baseman in the Jewish Community Center fast @-@ pitch softball league . " 
 Youkilis is Jewish and had a Bar Mitzvah at a Conservative synagogue . At the age of 14 , he had an uncredited one @-@ line speaking role in the romantic comedy film Milk Money . He attended Sycamore High School in the northeastern suburbs of Cincinnati , where he played third base , shortstop , first base , and the outfield for the school team which won the Amateur Athletic Union National Championship in 1994 , and he was the only player to homer off his future Red Sox teammate Aaron Cook in high school . 
 = = College = = 
 When he graduated from high school in 1997 , Youkilis weighed about 227 pounds and was 6 ' 1 " . He was recruited by two Division I schools : Butler University and his ultimate choice , the University of Cincinnati ( UC ) — an institution that was the alma mater of both his father and Youkilis ' longtime idol , Sandy Koufax , and had just finished a 12 – 46 season . UC coach Brian Cleary spotted Youkilis at a winter camp . " I looked at him and said , Well , we need somebody " , said Cleary . " I 'd love to tell you I saw something no one else did , but he was just better than what we had . " 
 While majoring in finance , Youkilis excelled as a player for the Cincinnati Bearcats from 1998 to 2001 . " I take no credit " , said Cleary . " He coaches himself . He knows his swing . Any time we said anything to him , he was already a step ahead . He made the adjustments he had to make . I just think he 's a really smart guy who had a great feel for what he had to do . " In his junior year in 2000 , he was a second @-@ team All @-@ American and first @-@ team All @-@ Conference USA , as he set school records by hitting three home runs in one game and 19 for the season ; still , he went undrafted . " He was kind of a square @-@ shaped body , a guy [ who ] in a uniform didn 't look all that athletic " , Cleary said . " He wasn 't a tall , prospect @-@ y looking guy . He looked chubby in a uniform . ... It wasn 't fat . He was strong . [ But ] I think the body did scare some people away . " 
 During the period between his junior and senior years , he played in the Cape Cod League , finishing sixth in the league in batting average . In his senior year in 2001 he repeated as second @-@ team All @-@ American . He set UC career records for home runs ( 56 ) , walks ( 206 ) , slugging percentage ( <unk> ) , and on @-@ base percentage ( <unk> ) with a batting average of .366 . " He had a great eye ... he hardly ever struck out looking " , said Brad Meador , UC 's associate head coach . " When he did , you knew the <unk> missed the call . " Cleary , noting how driven Youkilis was to succeed , told his father : " Your son 's going to be a millionaire some day . I don 't know if it 's in baseball , but he 's going to make some money one of these days . " Youkilis was later inducted into UC 's James Kelly Athletics Hall of Fame . 
 Yet , when asked what he liked about Youkilis , former Boston scout Matt Haas said : " At first glance , not a lot . He was unorthodox . He had an extreme crouch — his thighs were almost parallel to the ground . And he was heavier than he is now . But the more I watched him , the more I just thought , ' Throw the tools out the window . This guy can play baseball . ' " 
 In 2001 , at Haas ' urging , the Boston Red Sox drafted Youkilis in the eighth round ( 243rd overall ) , to the chagrin of Billy Beane , who had hoped that he would be able to draft him in a later round . ESPN reported that : " questions about his defense and power with wood kept him out of the top part of the draft . " He signed for a mere $ 12 @,@ 000 signing bonus . " Kevin would have played for a six @-@ pack of beer " , his father said . 
 " Teams didn ’ t appreciate performance as much then as they do now " , observed Red Sox VP of Player Personnel Ben <unk> eight years later . " His college performance was off the charts . If he [ were ] in the draft this year , he 'd be at least a sandwich pick , if not a first rounder . His performance was that good , in college and on the Cape . Now , teams appreciate what that means . There 's no way he ’ d last that long now . "

 In 2001 , Youkilis made his professional debut as a third baseman with the Lowell Spinners , a Short @-@ Season A Class franchise in the New York – Penn League . He went on to lead the league with a .512 OBP , 52 runs , and 70 walks ( against just 28 strikeouts ) , while hitting for a .317 batting average ( third in the league ) in 59 games . He also reached base safely by hit or walk in 46 consecutive games ( the third @-@ longest such streak in the minor leagues ) . Peter Gammons wrote that August : " Remember this name : Kevin Youkilis , who resembles Steve Balboni . " Honored by the Spinners with a " Youkilis bobblehead night " , Youkilis said : " It 's an honor — you know you 've made it when you get a bobblehead of yourself . " Promoted from Lowell towards the end of the season , he played five games with the Augusta GreenJackets of the South Atlantic League , a Low @-@ A Class league . He was named Red Sox Minor League Player of the Year . 
 In 2002 , Youkilis appeared in 15 games for Augusta , in 76 games for the Sarasota Sox ( 40 of them at first base ) , and in 44 games for the Trenton Thunder . He hit .310 , with eight home runs and 80 RBIs for the year , and he was voted Trenton 's " Player of the Year . " His .436 on @-@ base percentage was the fifth @-@ highest in the minors in 2002 , and his 80 walks were seventh @-@ most . In recognition of his performance , the Boston Red Sox named Youkilis their 2002 Minor League Player of the Year . 
 After the 2002 season , Boston 's then @-@ assistant general manager , Theo Epstein , sent Youkilis to the Athletes ' Performance Institute in Tempe , Arizona , where he engaged in an intensive six @-@ week training regimen . Youkilis then moved his off @-@ season home to Arizona , and attended the Institute in the 2004 – 08 off seasons as well . 
 In 2003 , Youkilis started the season with the Portland Sea Dogs . In 94 games , he led the Eastern League with a <unk> on @-@ base percentage ( best all @-@ time for the team through 2007 ) , and was third in the league with a .327 batting average ( second @-@ best all @-@ time for the team through 2007 ) . Later , he earned a spot on the Eastern League All @-@ Star team , the Baseball America AA All @-@ Star team , and on the U.S. roster for the 2003 All @-@ Star Futures Game . After Portland , Youkilis moved up to play for the Pawtucket Red Sox , the Boston Red Sox Class @-@ AAA franchise . During his time with Pawtucket , Youkilis managed to complete a streak he started while in Portland : he reached base in 71 consecutive games , tying future teammate Kevin Millar 's minor @-@ league record for consecutive games reaching base . His 104 walks were the third @-@ highest number recorded in the minors in 2003 . Asked , however , about the focus in position @-@ playing baseball on five @-@ tool players , Youkilis quipped , " I don 't even know if I have a tool . " 
 Writing for ESPN , John Sickels evaluated him as follows in mid @-@ 2003 : 
 Youkilis is an on @-@ base machine . He never swings at a bad pitch , and is adept at working counts and out @-@ thinking the pitcher . Unlike some guys who draw lots of walks , Youkilis seldom strikes out . He makes solid contact against both fastballs and breaking pitches . Youkilis ' swing is tailored for the line drive , and he may never hit for much home run power . But he hits balls to the gaps effectively , and could develop 10 – 14 home run power down the road . Youkilis does not have very good speed , though he is a decent baserunner . His defense at third base draws mixed reviews . His arm , range , and hands all rate as adequate / average . He doesn 't kill the defense at third base , but he doesn 't help it much , either , and is likely to end up at first base down the road . 
 Youkilis spent the 2003 – 04 winter in Mexico , playing for Navojoa of the Mexican Pacific League . In 2004 , he appeared in 32 games for Pawtucket , hitting .258 with three home runs , and a .347 on @-@ base percentage , before being called up to the Red Sox on May 15 . 
 In his minor league career through 2005 , he batted .299 with a .442 OBP while playing 340 games at third base , 59 at first base , and 2 at second base .

 On May 15 , 2004 , when Red Sox regular starting third baseman Bill Mueller was placed on the disabled list , Youkilis was called up for the first time . " I didn 't sleep much " , Youkilis said . " I got about four hours of sleep . ... They told me the night before I was playing .... I got in there , and man , I was just amped up and excited . " During his first major @-@ league game in Toronto , with his parents watching from the second row behind the dugout , Youkilis ( in his second at bat ) homered against 1996 Cy Young Award winner Pat Hentgen , becoming just the seventh player in team history to hit a home run in his first game . As a prank , the team initially gave Youkilis the silent treatment when he returned to the dugout after his homer . " This one will go down probably as the greatest day of my life " , he said . 
 Later , Youkilis was swept up in the team 's ritual annual hazing , in which he and other rookies were made to wear skimpy Hooters waitress outfits , orange satin shorts and tight , clingy white tank tops , for the team trip from Canada through US Customs in Florida . " I walked into the locker room , and all my clothes were gone " , Youkilis said . " There was just a Hooters outfit and shoes . " Youkilis was named the American League ( AL ) Rookie of the Month for May , after leading AL rookies with nine walks and a .446 OBP as he batting .318 with 7 RBIs , and 15 runs in 13 games . Noting ways that his life had suddenly changed , he said : " I 'm staying in the best hotel I 've ever stayed in , and my paycheck has quadrupled . " In mid @-@ July he was sent back down to AAA , however , to make room for Ramiro Mendoza , though he was brought up again towards the end of the season . 
 On September 24 of that year , which was Yom Kippur , Youkilis appeared in the dugout in uniform , but declined to participate in the game out of deference to the religious holiday . Youkilis was named the club 's Rookie of the Year by the Boston chapter of the Baseball Writers ' Association of America . For the season , in 44 games , he saw an average of 4 @.@ 67 pitches per plate appearance , first among major leaguers with at least 90 plate appearances . As Youkilis observed , " Fighting off pitches , fouling off pitches , laying off pitches , making it so the opposing pitcher can 't breathe ; that 's my job . " He was on the roster for the Red Sox for the 2004 American League Division Series ( ALDS ) , making his sole appearance in Game 2 against the Anaheim Angels . " It 's been an unbelievable ride " , Youkilis said . " It 's a great first year , a year you probably can 't top . Hopefully , it ends like a Cinderella story . " He was removed from the roster for the next round , the American League Championship Series ( ALCS ) , and was on the roster but did not play in the World Series . 
 = = = = 2005 = = = = 
 While virtually nobody else knew it , Youkilis broke his toe during spring training in 2005 , and was back playing again in a matter of days . It was " in Vero Beach " , Youkilis said . " I was trying to make the team . " 
 On the Red Sox Opening Day roster for the first time in his career in 2005 , Youkilis found himself on the way back down to Pawtucket on April 13 as the team needed to activate Curt Schilling , and Youkilis happened to still have minor league options ; but told that he would be back , Youkilis decided to keep his Boston apartment and commute to Pawtucket . Up and down all season as the Red Sox made use of his options , he got a call @-@ up — prompted by Bill Mueller having back spasms in batting practice — one August day as he was in Pawtucket 's clubhouse before a game . Without changing out of the same white pants that he wore for both Boston and Pawtucket home games , he packed his car , drove the 40 miles to Boston , walked into the Red Sox clubhouse , changed his jersey and cleats , and was ready to play . 
 He ultimately played 43 more games for Pawtucket in 2005 before being called up permanently . On September 18 , he fractured the tip of the ring finger of his right hand fielding a ground ball , and did not play again until October 2 , the final day of the regular season . In 2005 with Boston , Youkilis hit .278 with a .400 on @-@ base percentage in 79 at @-@ bats in 44 games during five stints with the team . He saw an average of 4 @.@ 68 pitches per plate appearance , the most of any Red Sox player with at least 50 at @-@ bats . He made 23 appearances at third base , 9 at first base , and 2 at second , and batted at least once from all nine spots in the batting order . 
 = = = = 2006 = = = = 
 In 2006 , his first full season in the majors , Youkilis became a regular first baseman ( with 127 games at first ) . Until that time , he was primarily a third baseman , though he did play nine games at first base with the Red Sox in 2005 , and 56 games at first base in his minor league career . Also in 2006 he played in the outfield for the first time in his professional career , 18 games in left field . Despite his inexperience in the outfield , Youkilis did not commit an error while in the outfield ; he did , however , commit eight errors while playing the infield . 
 Youkilis tied for the major league lead in sacrifice flies ( 11 ) and led the AL with 4 @.@ 43 pitches per plate appearance and by hitting line drives 24 % of time that he put balls in play . Also that year , Youkilis finished second in the AL in pitches seen ( 3 @,@ 009 ) and percent of pitches taken ( 63 @.@ 8 ) , 4th in OBP with runners in scoring position with two outs ( .524 ) , 7th in bases on balls ( 91 ; the six players ahead of him averaged 41 home runs and 14 intentional walks , while Youkilis hit only 13 homers and was not intentionally walked once ) , tied for 7th in " bases taken " ( 22 ; advanced on fly balls , passed balls , wild pitches , balks , etc . ) , 8th in doubles ( 42 ) and batting average with runners in scoring position with two out ( .375 ) , 9th in walk percentage ( 13 @.@ 8 % ) , and 10th in times on base ( 259 ) . He scored 100 runs , hit for a .325 batting average with runners in scoring position , and hit four first inning leadoff home runs . He did this despite struggling in the second half of the season with plantar fasciitis and a problematic abdominal muscle . 
 = = = = 2007 = = = = 
 Youkilis had a career @-@ high 23 @-@ game hitting streak starting on May 5 , 2007 , and ending on June 2 , 2007 , in which he hit .426 ( 43 – 101 ) with 13 doubles , 6 HRs , 21 RBIs , and a <unk> OBP . At one point during the hitting streak , he had 9 straight games with at least two hits ( tying a Red Sox record set by Jim Rice in 1978 ) , and became the first Red Sox hitter since Trot Nixon to hit an inside @-@ the @-@ park home run . During the hitting streak , on May 20 , he hit what would be the shortest homer by a Sox player during the season — a 321 @-@ foot homer around the Pesky Pole . The home run would not have cleared the fence at any of the other 29 ballparks in baseball . Although the hit streak ended on June 2 , he did walk three times in an 11 – 6 win over the Yankees . 
 His manager Terry Francona said , " He 's taking more of what the pitchers give him , using the whole field . He 's going to work the count about as good as any hitter in baseball . Last year if he got a two @-@ strike breaking ball , he might swing and miss . This year he 's fouling it off , or taking it to right field . " 
 On June 1 , Yankees pitcher Scott Proctor hit Youkilis in the head with a pitch ; Proctor was ejected from the game . On August 30 , Yankees pitcher Joba Chamberlain threw a pair of 98 mph pitches over Youkilis 's head ; Chamberlain was ejected , and later also suspended two games for " inappropriate actions . " " That 's the second time " , Youkilis observed . " Scott Proctor hit me in the head . Coincidence ? I don 't know . It doesn 't look good . " 
 On June 25 , 2007 , Youkilis played in his 120th consecutive game at first base without an error , breaking the prior Red Sox record set in 1921 by Stuffy McInnis . On September 7 , he played in his 179th consecutive game at first base without an error , which broke the prior AL record set in 1973 by Mike Hegan . 
 On September 15 , Yankees pitcher Chien @-@ Ming Wang struck Youkilis on his right wrist with a pitch , resulting in a deep tendon bruise that kept him out until September 25 , when he returned with the aid of a cortisone shot . In 2007 , Youkilis was 6th in the AL with 15 hit by pitch ( HBP ) . 
 Youkilis 's error @-@ less streak at the end of the regular season was 190 games ; while he was charged with an error in the sixth inning of an October 16 , 2007 , playoff game against the Cleveland Indians , postseason games are not included in the record . Youkilis said , " I 'm not worried about making the error . I 'm worried about trying to help the team win and trying to get an out any way we can . " Leading the league with a perfect 1 @.@ 000 fielding percentage , and an AL @-@ record 1 @,@ 079 error @-@ less chances at first , Youkilis won the 2007 AL Gold Glove award for first basemen . 
 While he batted .288 for the season , with men on base , he hit .340 with a .435 OBP . He was 6th in the league in pitches per plate appearance ( 4 @.@ 27 ) . 
 In the first inning of Game 1 of the ALDS against the Angels he hit his first post @-@ season home run . It was his first homer since returning from being hit by Wang , and Youkilis said his wrist " felt a lot better as the days have progressed . I think the best thing about it is that it 's playoff time , and adrenaline helps the most . " In the 7 @-@ game ALCS against the Indians he hit three more home runs , had 14 hits ( tying the LCS record jointly held by Hideki Matsui and Albert Pujols since 2004 ) , and scored 10 runs ( bettering Matsui 's 2004 ALCS record ) while batting .500 ( another new ALCS record , bettering Bob Boone 's .455 in 1986 ) with a .576 OBP and a .929 slugging percentage . 
 Still , in the World Series against Colorado , he did not start the team 's away games . Francona faced a dilemma when playing without a DH in the NL park of having to bench either Youkilis , 120 @-@ RBI man Mike Lowell , or 117 @-@ RBI man David Ortiz , as he had to choose from among them which two would play first base and third base . Bob Ryan of The Boston Globe called it " the most difficult decision any American League manager has had to make in the 34 @-@ year history of the DH " . Youkilis said , " It doesn 't bother me . I want to play , but I totally understand the situation . Look , I 'm doing everything I 've always wanted to do . I 'm playing in a World Series . I 'm playing every day . I 'm happy . I just want to win .... If I have to take a seat , that 's just the way it has to be . " Youkilis hit two doubles ( both in Game 1 ) and had three walks in only 12 plate appearances in the 4 @-@ game win over Colorado , as he was not in the starting lineup for the away games . Dismissing questions as to whether he was upset about being benched for the last two games of the World Series , Youkilis said , " Move on and go to another team if you ’ re worried about your playing time , and think you deserve to play over somebody else . " 
 Youkilis was selected the 2007 recipient of the Jackie Jensen Award for spirit and determination by the Boston BBWAA chapter . 
 = = = = 2008 = = = = 
 In 2007 , Youkilis had earned $ 424 @,@ 500 , the fourth @-@ lowest salary on the club . In February 2008 , he signed a one @-@ year contract for $ 3 million , avoiding salary arbitration . In March 2008 , his role as the designated player representative of the Red Sox became known during the resolution of a player @-@ management dispute regarding non @-@ payment of coaches and staff for the Red Sox trip to Japan . 
 On April 2 , 2008 , on an unassisted game @-@ ending play against the Oakland A 's , Youkilis broke the Major League record for most consecutive error @-@ less games by a first baseman , previously held by Steve Garvey , at 194 games . In his 205th game without an error on April 27 , Youkilis also established a new major league record for first basemen , when he fielded his <unk> consecutive chance without an error , passing the old mark of 1 @,@ 700 set by Stuffy McInnis from 1921 to 1922 . His streak , which started on July 4 , 2006 , was snapped at 238 games ( 2 @,@ 002 fielding attempts ) on June 7 , 2008 against the Seattle Mariners . 
 He was named AL Player of the Week for May 5 – 11 , after batting .375 while leading the AL with five home runs , and tying for the American League lead with 10 RBIs . 
 In an early June game at Fenway Park , one camera reportedly showed Manny Ramirez taking a swing at Youkilis , and the two had to be separated by teammates in the Red Sox dugout . " I think they were just exchanging some views on things " , manager Terry Francona said . " We had a lot of testosterone going tonight . " Asked about the incident the following year , Youkilis said : " We have two different approaches to the game . Winning and losing isn ’ t life and death to Manny . " 
 He was the AL 's starter at first base on the 2008 AL All @-@ Star team that played the 79th Major League Baseball All @-@ Star Game at Yankee Stadium , voted in by the fans with 2 @,@ 858 @,@ 130 votes in his first year on the ballot . Youkilis became the sixth Red Sox first baseman to start an All @-@ Star Game at first base , following Jimmie Foxx ( 1938 ; 40 ) , Walt Dropo ( 1950 ) , Mickey Vernon ( 1956 ) , George Scott ( 1966 ) , and Mo Vaughn ( 1996 ) . 
 In late July , Manny Ramirez was traded away by the Red Sox . Youkilis took over the cleanup spot of the lineup . 
 In 2008 , Youkilis led the AL in at bats per RBI ( 4 @.@ 7 ) , was 3rd in slugging percentage ( <unk> ) and sacrifice flies ( 9 ) , 4th in RBIs ( 115 ) , extra base hits ( 76 ) , and OPS ( .958 ) ; 5th in hit by pitch ( 12 ) ; 6th in batting average ( .312 ) and on @-@ base percentage ( .390 ) ; 7th in doubles ( 43 ) and in times advanced from first to third on a single ( 14 ) ; 8th in total bases ( 306 ) , 10th in at @-@ bats per home run ( 18 @.@ 6 ) , and 12th in home runs ( 29 ) . He was also 2nd in extra base hit percentage ( 12 @.@ 2 % of all plate appearances ) and tied for 7th in times advanced from first to third on a single ( 14 ) . 
 Youkilis also batted .356 against relief pitchers , .358 with men on base , and .374 with runners in scoring position . He drew seven intentional walks during the 2008 season , the first season he had garnered any , and also led the AL with a .353 batting average after the sixth inning . Youkilis became just the third modern major leaguer ( since 1901 ) ever to bat over .300 with more than 100 RBIs during a season in which he spent at least 30 games at both first and third base ; St. Louis ' Albert Pujols ( 2001 ) and Cleveland 's Al Rosen ( 1954 ) are the only other players to accomplish the feat . 
 Youkilis finished third in the balloting for the 2008 AL MVP Award , receiving two first @-@ place votes ( one from Evan Grant of The Dallas Morning News ) , while his teammate Dustin Pedroia won and Justin Morneau came in second . Only Youkilis and Morneau were named on all ballots . 
 In the ALCS Game 5 vs. the Tampa Bay Rays , the Red Sox were down by seven runs in the bottom of the seventh inning . Youkilis scored the winning run for the Red Sox to complete the second @-@ largest comeback in MLB postseason history . Before Game 4 of the 2008 World Series , he was named the winner of the AL Hank Aaron Award for the best offensive performance of the 2008 season . 
 = = = = 2009 = = = = 
 Youkilis signed a four @-@ year , $ 41 @.@ 25 million contract with the Red Sox on January 15 , 2009 . The deal also included a team option ( at $ 14 million , with a $ 1 @.@ 25 million buyout ) for 2013 . Later that year , he was voted # 36 on the Sporting News list of the 50 greatest active baseball players , voted on by a panel that included members of the Baseball Hall of Fame . 
 Youkilis batted cleanup for Team USA in the 2009 World Baseball Classic , tying for the lead among all WBC players in home runs ( 3 ) and runs ( 9 ) , and tying for second on the team in RBIs ( 6 ) and walks ( 6 ) , through the first two rounds . He had to leave the team with a left ankle sprain , however , before the WBC semifinals . 
 Youkilis hit a walk off home run against the Yankees on April 24 , 2009 . " He has skills , man " , said David Ortiz . " I don 't know how he do it . He just do it . " He was subsequently placed on the disabled list a few days later , but returned to play on May 20 . " It 's frustrating not being able to play " , he said . " Watching baseball is not something I like to do . " 
 Youkilis was picked to be a reserve on the AL 2009 All @-@ Star team by Tampa Bay and AL manager Joe Maddon , after coming in second in the fan vote to Mark Teixeira , 3 @,@ 309 @,@ 050 to 3 @,@ 069 @,@ 906 . 
 On August 6 , 2009 , with the Red Sox suffering numerous injuries , Youkilis played left field for the first time since he played 18 games there in 2006 . On August 8 , he again played left field , and made a couple of twists and turns on a fly ball hit by Johnny Damon before committing an error . 
 On August 11 , 2009 , after 6 ' 5 " pitcher Rick Porcello of the Detroit Tigers hit him in the back with an 89 mph pitch , Youkilis immediately charged Porcello on the mound . Youkilis threw his helmet at the fast back @-@ pedaling Porcello , and Porcello tackled Youkilis , both went down , and both benches cleared . Both players were tossed from the game , and each received a five @-@ game suspension . 
 Hearing that his friend and former minor league teammate Greg <unk> had died of testicular cancer at the age of 31 late on August 21 , Youkilis dedicated his next game to his friend 's memory . After inscribing " GM " in marker on his cap , he hit two home runs in the game against the Yankees , while driving in six runs . Both times as he crossed home plate , he looked up and pointed to the sky . " That was for him " , Youkilis said . " There are some crazy things that have happened in my life . You ... feel like there 's somebody out there somewhere pushing balls out for you , and doing great things . " 
 In 2009 , Youkilis was 2nd in the AL in OBP ( .413 ) and OPS ( <unk> ) , 4th in hit by pitch ( 16 ) , 5th in slugging percentage ( <unk> ) , and batted .305 overall and .362 with runners in scoring position . He also led the AL in pitches per plate appearance ( 4 @.@ 42 ) , was 6th in batting average on balls in play ( .363 ) , and 10th in walk percentage ( 13 @.@ 6 % ) . " Statistically , if you consider 2008 and 2009 , you could make the case there has been no better player in the league [ in that time ] " , said Red Sox EVP Epstein . Of the players with 1 @,@ 000 plate appearances in the AL over the 2008 – 09 seasons , none had a higher OPS than Youkilis ( .960 ) . 
 In the field , while Youkilis split his time primarily between first base and third base and therefore did not qualify for the fielding percentage title at either , his .998 fielding percentage in 78 games at first matched that of the league leader Lyle Overbay , and his .974 fielding percentage in 63 games at third base was better than league @-@ leader Melvin Mora 's <unk> . 
 Youkilis finished sixth in balloting for the 2009 AL MVP Award , receiving two second @-@ place votes . He was selected as the Red Sox most valuable player ( winner of the 2009 Thomas A. Yawkey Memorial Award ) in voting by the Boston Chapter of the Baseball Writers ' Association of America .

 In 2010 , Youkilis was again named to Sporting News ' list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball , ranking No. 38 on the list . A panel of 21 MLB executives was polled to arrive at the list . 
 On May 18 , 2010 , Youkilis hit his 100th career home run off C.C. Sabathia . 
 On August 2 , Youkilis ' season was cut short by a right thumb abductor muscle tear , which he had played through for two weeks . At the time of his injury , he was tied for 3rd in the major leagues in runs scored ( 77 ) , and led all major leaguers with a <unk> slugging percentage against left @-@ handed pitchers . He was 3rd in the AL in on @-@ base percentage ( .411 ) , tied for 5th in walks ( 58 ) , tied for 7th in extra @-@ base hits ( 50 ) , 8th in slugging percentage ( <unk> ) , and 9th in total bases ( 204 ) . He had surgery to repair the tear on August 6 . 
 The injury limited him to only 102 games for the season , his fewest since his 2005 sophomore year . Slowed by his injury , he had only 362 at @-@ bats , but batted .307 / .411 / <unk> with 19 home runs and 62 RBIs . For the years 2008 – 10 , his .964 OPS ranked second in the major leagues , behind Albert Pujols ( 1 @.@ 074 ) .

 During the offseason the Red Sox acquired All @-@ Star first baseman Adrian Gonzalez , and with the imminent departure of Adrián Beltré , Youkilis agreed to the make the switch back to third base . 
 In 2011 , Youkilis was again named to Sporting News ' list of the 50 greatest current players in baseball , ranking No. 35 on the list . A panel of 21 MLB executives was polled to arrive at the list . 
 Youkilis was named a reserve for the 82nd All @-@ Star Game . At the All @-@ Star break , he was 3rd in the league in doubles ( 26 ) , 4th in on @-@ base percentage ( <unk> ) , 6th in RBIs ( 63 ) , 7th in OPS ( .911 ) , and 9th in walks ( 49 ) . For the season , he led all AL third basemen in fielding percentage , at .967 . However , he batted only .258 , his lowest MLB season average of his career . 
 The Red Sox suffered a collapse late in the 2011 season , losing their playoff positioning . A source among the Red Sox claimed that Josh Beckett , Jon Lester , and John Lackey spent games they did not pitch in the clubhouse eating fried chicken and drinking beer ; some Red Sox teammates speculated that Youkilis was the source of this information , alienating him from his teammates .

 On April 15 , 2012 , Red Sox manager Bobby Valentine publicly questioned Youkilis ' motivation and physical ability to succeed . Viewing rookie Will Middlebrooks as the superior third baseman , Valentine began to play Middlebrooks over Youkilis . The Red Sox traded Youkilis to the Chicago White Sox on June 24 for pitcher Zach Stewart and utility man Brent <unk> . The Red Sox agreed to pay $ 5 @.@ 5 million of Youkilis ' salary to help close the deal . In the seventh inning of that day 's game , Ben <unk> , the Red Sox General Manager , informed Valentine that a transaction was pending . Youkilis hit a triple in his last at bat , and received a long standing ovation while tipping his helmet to the crowd after being taken out for pinch runner Nick Punto .

 The next day , Youkilis started for the White Sox , playing against the Minnesota Twins . He went 1 – 4 with a single in a loss . He hit his first home run as a member of the White Sox on July 3 , against the Texas Rangers off of Roy Oswalt . He also went 3 – 6 with 4 RBIs in that game . On July 9 , 2012 Youkilis was named the American League Player of the Week , after batting .478 with three home runs and ten RBIs in a 5 – 1 span for the White Sox . White Sox manager Robin Ventura reported that Youkilis was a competitor with a " grinder mentality " , who fit in well with his White Sox teammates . He became a free agent after the 2012 season .

The deal became official on December 14 . 
 Youkilis was diagnosed with a back strain when the 2013 season began and was placed on the 15 @-@ day disabled list on April 30 , 2013 . He was activated and returned on May 30 , 2013 . He was placed back on the disabled list on June 14 , 2013 after restraining his back . He then underwent season @-@ ending surgery to repair a herniated disk in his back on June 20 , 2013 .

 Michael Lewis 's 2003 best @-@ seller Moneyball : The Art of Winning an Unfair Game focuses on Oakland Athletics ' General Manager Billy Beane 's use of Sabermetrics as a tool in the evaluation of potential prospects . In the book , Lewis discusses then @-@ prospect Youkilis in detail , and refers to him as " <unk> , the Greek God of Walks " , a moniker that has stuck . Beane put more stock in empirical evidence than in scouts ' hunches , and did not care that Youkilis was pudgy ( or , as Lewis put it in the book , " a fat third baseman who couldn 't run , throw , or field " ) , but just loved his ability to get on base ( helped in no small part by his 20 / 11 vision ) . The book brought minor leaguer Youkilis his first national recognition . 
 Lewis also revealed that Beane repeatedly tried to trade for Youkilis before Youkilis reached the major leagues , but his attempts were blocked by then @-@ Red Sox GM Theo Epstein . 
 Asked by a reporter what he thought of the nickname , Youkilis quipped , " It 's better than being ' the Greek God of Illegitimate Children . ' " But according to his dad , " Kevin disliked that Greek God of Walks stuff . " Fans actually rooted for Youkilis to take pitches . " It was frustrating to hear fans say , ' Get a walk !

 On August 8 , 2005 , while playing for the Red Sox , Youkilis took the field in the 9th inning along with Adam Stern and Gabe Kapler , setting a record for the most Jewish players on the field at one time in AL history , and the most in Major League Baseball history since four Jewish players took the field for the New York Giants in a game in 1941 . 
 Youkilis was featured in the 2008 Hank Greenberg 75th Anniversary edition of Jewish Major Leaguers Baseball Cards , published in affiliation with <unk> Trading Cards and the American Jewish Historical Society , commemorating the Jewish Major Leaguers from 1871 through 2008 . He joined , among other Jewish major leaguers , Ryan Braun , Brad Ausmus , Ian Kinsler , Brian Horwitz , Gabe Kapler , Jason Marquis , Jason Hirsh , John Grabow , Craig Breslow , and Scott Schoeneweis . 
 He was one of three Jewish players in the 2008 All @-@ Star Game , joining Braun and Kinsler , and one of three Jewish players on the Team USA 2009 World Baseball Classic team , joining Braun and Grabow . Kinsler says that " Youkilis always says something to me on the bases . ' Happy Passover , ' he 'll throw something at me . " 
 Youkilis was named the Jewish MVP for 2008 , beating out fellow All @-@ Stars Braun and Kinsler . He was voted the top Jewish baseball player of the decade 2000 – 09 in online balloting , beating out Shawn Green and Braun . Through the 2010 season , his .294 batting average placed him 6th on the career all @-@ time list ( directly behind Phil Weintraub ) for batting average by Jewish major leaguers , his 112 home runs placed him 8th ( behind Braun ) , and his 470 RBIs placed him 9th ( behind Ausmus ) . 
 In Jews and Baseball : An American Love Story , a 2010 documentary film narrated by Dustin Hoffman , Youkilis noted : 
 It 's something that I probably won ’ t realize until my career is over , how many people are really rooting for me and cheering for me . And it 's not just because I went 3 @-@ for @-@ 4 , or had a great game . It 's just the fact that I represent a lot of Jewish people and a lot of the Jewish heritage , and the struggles that a lot of our people have had . 
 He expressed interest in 2013 in playing for Israel at the World Baseball Classic if healthy . Since the 2013 qualifier was during the regular season , he was unable to complete , however he announced that he would play for the team if they made it past the qualifying round of the 2013 World Baseball Classic . Youkilis will be a coach for Israel during the 2017 World Baseball Classic 
 In an embarrassing formatting oddity , it was noticed in 2007 that multiple baseball websites such as Baseball @-@ Reference.com and Baseball Prospectus had been using " <unk> " as part of their urls for webpages featuring Youkilis . This unintended quirk affected those sites that used an automatic url @-@ creating algorithm which combined the first five letters of a player 's surname with the first two letters of his first name . Following the discovery , the sites manually adjusted the urls to remove the inadvertent slur .

To this day , he said , " I sit back at night and wonder what I could 've done . " 
 " In my religion , the Jewish religion , that 's one of the biggest things that 's taught , is giving a mitzvah , forming a mitzvah " , said Youkilis . " I was always taught as a kid giving to charity . You 're supposed to give a good amount of charity each and every year . ... It 's just a great thing when you can make a kid smile that 's going through some hard times in life ... I wish more people , not just athletes , would give people just a little bit of their time . It doesn 't take much ... It can make a huge difference . " 
 After the first game of the ALDS , Youkilis re @-@ shaved his head for good luck in a sign of solidarity with cancer patient Mitt Campbell . Following the team 's 2007 World Series victory , Youkilis shaved his goatee for a $ 5 @,@ 000 donation by Gillette to his foundation .

 = Fair dealing in United Kingdom law = 
 Fair dealing in United Kingdom law is a doctrine which provides an exception to United Kingdom copyright law , in cases where the copyright infringement is for the purposes of non @-@ commercial research or study , criticism or review , or for the reporting of current events . More limited than the United States doctrine of fair use , fair dealing originates in Sections 29 and 30 of the Copyright , Designs and Patents Act 1988 , and requires the infringer to show not only that their copying falls into one of the three fair dealing categories , but also that it is " fair " and , in some cases , that it contains sufficient acknowledgement for the original author . Factors when deciding the " fairness " of the copying can include the quantity of the work taken , whether or not it was previously published , the motives of the infringer and what the consequences of the infringement on the original author 's returns for the copyrighted work will be . 
 Research and study does not apply to commercial research , and does not include infringements of broadcasts , sound recordings or film ; it also has only a limited application to software . These exclusions have been criticised as failing " to reflect the increasing importance of non @-@ textual media for both study and research " . Research cannot be private , and in a non @-@ academic setting must also not have a future potential commercial purpose . This exception also excludes , under Section 29 ( 3 ) ( b ) of the 1988 Act , copying which will result in " copies of substantially the same material being provided to more than one person at substantially the same time and for substantially the same purpose " . Criticism or review is interpreted liberally , and may include criticism or review of a work 's social or moral implications or its impact , but this exception is only available when the work in question has been previously made available to the public . Reporting of current events is only an exception where the event is " current " , and may exclude trivial or ephemeral news ; such news can , however , become an " event " through media coverage . 
 = = Definition = = 
 Fair dealing is an exception to United Kingdom copyright law which allows for the use of copyrighted works without licensing in certain circumstances . It is governed by Sections 29 and 30 of the Copyright , Designs and Patents Act 1988 , which provide three types of situation in which fair dealing is a valid defence : where the use is for the purposes of research or private study , where it is to allow for criticism or review , and where it is for the purpose of reporting current events . This can be contrasted with the United States doctrine of fair use , which provides a general defence rather than rigid and specific categories of acceptable behaviour . Under United Kingdom law , an infringer relying on fair dealing as a defence must show that their actions fall into a specific category of acceptable use , as opposed to the " illustrative open list of purposes " in US law . The fair dealing exceptions had previously been formalised in case law as " fair use " forms , but this was eliminated by the Copyright Act 1911 . 
 = = Fair dealing = = 
 Fair dealing is a defence after the fact . If sued for copyright infringement , one can rely on fair dealing as a defence in court , but the defence " only comes into play once a claimant has established that copyright has been infringed . Where this occurs , the onus of proof [ then ] falls on the defendant to prove that one of the exceptions applies " . This is done first by proving that the infringement falls within one of the three categories , which are liberally interpreted by the courts . The courts will not , however , give any consideration to what the infringer thought his work was for , or rely on a subjective test in any way ; as in Hyde Park Residence v Yelland , it is not seen as necessary " for the court to put itself in the shoes of the infringer of the copyright " . Instead , a more objective test is used , to avoid providing " any encouragement to the notion that all that is required is for the user to have a sincere belief , however misguided , that he or she is criticising a work or reporting current affairs " . 
 If the copyright infringer can show that their use falls within one of the three categories , they must then show that the dealing was " fair " . This takes into account a number of things , and due to the freedom of speech provisions under the Human Rights Act 1998 is deliberately intended not to be based on rigid and inflexible tests . Instead , as in Ashdown v Telegraph Group Ltd , the courts " bear in mind that considerations of public interest are paramount " . Because of this , there are many different things which enhance or detract from the " fair " nature of the dealing . If the copyrighted work had not been " made available to the public " at the time , this will count against the use being fair , and makes the defence on the grounds of criticism and review " unavailable " . The courts will give different weight to different kinds of documents ; a series of private letters which have not been published will detract more from the fairness of the infringement than unpublished official reports which discuss matters of public interest . 
 How the work was obtained and for what purpose is also a factor . If the work was obtained illegally or unethically , the dealing is less likely to be " fair " than if it was legitimately acquired . Similarly , if the motives of the dealing are negative , the fairness will be impugned . As in Hyde Park , the court must " judge the fairness by the objective standard of whether a fair minded and honest person would have dealt with the copyright work in the manner " in question . Consequences are also a factor ; if , as in Hubbard v Vosper , the parties to the case are competitors and infringing on the work acts as an alternative to purchasing the original , this will limit the fairness of the dealing . Occasionally the courts will also consider whether the purpose of the infringement could have been achieved in a less intrusive way , as in Hyde Park . 
 The quantity of the work taken is also taken into account . If the infringer uses the majority of a copyrighted work , or all of it , they reduce the expected returns of the copyright owner and compromise " the role that copyright plays in encouraging creativity " . As such , the fair dealing defence usually only applies when part of a work has been taken , although some judicial comments , such as those of Megaw LJ in Hubbard , state that there are a few cases in which the work is so short that reproducing it in its entirety may be acceptable . The use made of the work is another factor ; if the infringer takes a copyrighted work and reorganises or reinterprets it , the courts are more likely to find that the dealing qualifies as fair than if the work is simply reproduced without modification or analysis . In some situations , the fair dealing defence must be accompanied by " sufficient acknowledgement " , where the author and the original work must be identified either by the title or some other description . 
 = = = Research and study = = = 
 Under Section 29 ( 1 ) of the 1988 Act , fair dealing is a valid defence when dealing with copyright infringement for the purpose of non @-@ commercial research or private study . This applies to " literary , dramatical , musical and artistic works , as well as with the typographical formats of published works " ; it does not apply to infringement of broadcasts , sound recordings or film . The rationale for this exception to copyright law is that research and study is necessary to create new works and inspire innovation , while the non @-@ commercial nature of the research does not interfere with the rewards that copyright provides to the original copyright holder . The limited nature of the exception is criticised by Burrell and Coleman , who argue that it " fails to reflect the increasing importance of non @-@ textual media for both study and research " . The exception also has only a limited application to things such as software . 
 For this defence to apply , the infringer must show that the dealing is for non @-@ commercial research or private study , private study being defined by Section 178 as excluding any study directly or indirectly for commercial purpose ; it therefore covers most academic purposes , but not things such as the use of a database in market @-@ testing of new drugs . Research , when not academic , is covered by The Controller of Her Majesty 's Stationery Office , Ordnance Survey v Green Amps Ltd , which sets the test as whether or not it is thought that the research would be used for a commercial purpose in the future . Although the precise distinction between research and private study has not historically been important , modern case law states that there is a difference . Unlike study , research cannot be private , as the exception to copyright law is justified because research provides a benefit to society as a whole . As with all fair dealing exceptions , copying for research or study purposes must also be " fair " , taking into account the various factors mentioned above . 
 There are special cases , particularly when dealing with copying by third parties . If the person doing the copying is not the one doing the research , different rules apply ; a publisher cannot use it to justify printing parts of other publishers works , as in Sillitoe v McGraw Hill , but in order to uphold the exception 's justification , the courts do recognise that it can cover a research assistant making photocopies on behalf of a student or researcher . However , as a limitation , Section 29 ( 3 ) ( b ) provides that the copying cannot be fair dealing if the person doing it knows that it will result in " copies of substantially the same material being provided to more than one person at substantially the same time and for substantially the same purpose " . In other words , an academic cannot print off multiple copies of a work for students and then rely on the fair dealings exception . 
 = = = Criticism or review = = = 
 Section 30 ( 1 ) of the 1988 Act provides that the fair dealing exception is valid if the material is being copied for criticism or review . For it to apply , the infringer must be able to show that the dealing was for criticism or review , that the infringed work was previously made available to the public , that the dealing was fair , and that the dealing was accompanied by an acknowledgement . The first step requires the defendant to show that the copying was done to criticise or review the work in question , the performance of the work , or , as in <unk> v <unk> , another work . The courts will interpret " criticism or review " liberally , as in Newspaper Licensing Agency v Marks & Spencers plc , and as such the criticism or review can include the thought or philosophy of the work , as in Time Warner v Channel 4 , or the social and moral implications of the work , as in Pro Sieben Media v Carlton Television . 
 The exception is only applicable where the work has previously been made available to the public " by any means " including the issuing of copies , lending copies , performing or exhibiting a copyrighted piece , or communicating it to the public . If the work has not been clearly made available not just to others but to the public in general , the exception does not apply , as in HRH the Prince of Wales v Associated Newspapers . Although Prince Charles had distributed copies of his diary to 75 people , this clearly did not make the journals available to the public , as each recipient was under strict instructions to keep the work confidential . The dealing must also be shown to have been fair , taking into account the many factors considered by the courts . Bently and Sherman suggest that in relation to fair dealings for criticism or review , the most relevant aspects considered by the court are likely to be the quantity taken , the method of acquisition and the consequences . 
 = = = Reporting of current events = = = 
 Under Section 30 ( 2 ) , fair dealing using any work for the purpose of reporting current events , with sufficient acknowledgement , is a valid exception to copyright . Photographs are excluded , however ; Cornish , Llewelyn and Aplin write that this is " in order to preserve the full value of holding a unique visual record of some person or event " . A crucial element of the " current events " exception is whether or not the reporting covers " current " events . " The older the issue , the less likely it is that it will be treated as having any currency " . Hyde Park confirmed that , where an event that took place some time ago is still being discussed , that can be treated as " current " . The nature of " events " must also be confirmed ; while some things will be inherently considered events , such as matters of national importance , major sporting contests or important political occasions , others may not be . Matters that are " trivial , ephemeral or immaterial " may not be treated as events , although it has been confirmed that media attention can transform a trivial matter into an " event " , as in Pro Sieben . The copyrighted works must also directly deal with the current events ; Associated Newspapers v News Group Newspapers , for example , concerned the republication of correspondence between Wallis Simpson and her husband on the occasion of Simpson 's death . It was held that the correspondence did not relate closely enough to the death for the fair dealing exception to apply . 
 The dealing must also be " fair " , with the most important factors being the quantity of the work used , whether or not use of the copyrighted work is necessary , and whether or not the work has been previously published . The Court of Appeal has confirmed in Ashdown that the defence should always be available " where the public interest in learning of the very words written by the owner of the copyright is such that the publication should not be inhibited by the chilling factor of having to pay damages or account of profits " . Sufficient acknowledgement to the original author is also necessary for all works where the fair dealing exception is applied . Under Section 30 ( 3 ) , however , this is not required for reporting via a sound recording , film or broadcast where it would be " impossible for reasons of practicality or otherwise " . 
 = = = Parody , caricature and pastiche = = = 
 As of 1 October 2014 , Section 30A provides for fair dealing as a defence in cases where the infringement was for the purpose of caricature , parody or pastiche . The Intellectual Property Office suggests that a " parody " is something that imitates a work for humorous or satirical effect , a " pastiche " is a composition that is made up of selections from various sources or one that imitates the style of another artist or period , and that a " caricature " is something that portrays its subject in a simplified or exaggerated way , whether insulting or complimentary and whether for a political purpose or solely for entertainment . The same amendment also broadened the scope of the fair dealing defence for " quotation . " 
 = Survival horror = 
 Survival horror is a subgenre of action @-@ adventure or adventure video games inspired by horror fiction that focuses on survival of the character as the game tries to frighten players with either horror graphics or scary ambience . Although combat can be part of the gameplay , the player is made to feel less in control than in typical action games through limited ammunition , health , speed and vision , or through various obstructions of the player 's interaction with the game mechanics . The player is also challenged to find items that unlock the path to new areas and solve puzzles to proceed in the game . Games make use of strong horror themes , like dark maze @-@ like environments and unexpected attacks from enemies . 
 The term " survival horror " was first used for the original Japanese release of Resident Evil in 1996 which was influenced by earlier games with a horror theme such as 1989 's Sweet Home . The name has been used since then for games with similar gameplay , and has been retroactively applied to earlier titles . Starting with the release of Resident Evil 4 in 2005 , the genre began to incorporate more features from action games and more traditional first person and third @-@ person shooter games . This has led game journalists to question whether long @-@ standing survival horror franchises and more recent franchises have abandoned the genre and moved into a different distinct genre often referred to as " action horror " . Still , the survival horror genre has persisted in one form or another . 
 = = Definition = = 
 Survival horror refers to a subgenre of horror video games . The player character is vulnerable and under @-@ armed , which puts emphasis on puzzle @-@ solving and evasion , rather than violence . Games commonly challenge the player to manage their inventory and ration scarce resources such as ammunition . Another major theme throughout the genre is that of isolation . Typically , these games contain relatively few non @-@ player characters and , as a result , frequently tell much of their story second @-@ hand through the usage of journals , texts , or audio logs . 
 While many action games feature lone protagonists versus swarms of enemies in a suspenseful environment , survival horror games are distinct from otherwise horror @-@ themed action games . They tend to de @-@ emphasize combat in favor of challenges such as hiding or running from enemies and solving puzzles . Still , it is not unusual for survival horror games to draw upon elements from first @-@ person shooters , action @-@ adventure games , or even role @-@ playing games . " Survival horror is different from typical game genres in that it is not defined strictly by specific mechanics , but subject matter , tone , pacing , and design philosophy . " 
 = = Game design = = 
 = = = De @-@ emphasized combat = = = 
 Survival horror games are a subgenre of horror games , where the player is unable to fully prepare or arm their avatar . The player usually encounters several factors to make combat unattractive as a primary option , such as a limited number of weapons or invulnerable enemies , if weapons are available , their ammunition is sparser than in other games , and powerful weapons such as rocket launchers are rare , if even available at all . Thus , players are more vulnerable than in action games , and the hostility of the environment sets up a narrative where the odds are weighed decisively against the avatar . This gameplay shifts away from direct combat , and players must learn to evade enemies or turn the environment against them . Games try to enhance the experience of vulnerability by making the game single player rather than multiplayer , and by giving the player an avatar who is more frail than the typical action game hero . 
 The survival horror genre is also known for other non @-@ combat challenges , such as solving puzzles at certain locations in the game world , and collecting and managing an inventory of items . Areas of the game world will be off limits until the player gains certain items . Occasionally , levels are designed with alternative routes . Levels also challenge players with maze @-@ like environments , which test the player 's navigational skills . Levels are often designed as dark and claustrophobic ( often making use of dim or shadowy light conditions and camera angles and sightlines which restrict visibility ) to challenge the player and provide suspense , although games in the genre also make use of enormous spatial environments . 
 = = = Enemy design = = = 
 A survival horror storyline usually involves the investigation and confrontation of horrific forces , and thus many games transform common elements from horror fiction into gameplay challenges . Early releases utilized camera angles seen in horror films , which allowed enemies to lurk in areas that are concealed from the player 's view . Also , many survival horror games make use of off @-@ screen sound or other warning cues to notify the player of impending danger . This feedback assists the player , but also creates feelings of anxiety and uncertainty . 
 Games typically feature a variety of monsters with unique behavior patterns . Enemies can appear unexpectedly or suddenly , and levels are often designed with scripted sequences where enemies drop from the ceiling or crash through windows . Survival horror games , like many action @-@ adventure games , are structured around the boss encounter where the player must confront a formidable opponent in order to advance to the next area . These boss encounters draw elements from antagonists seen in classic horror stories , and defeating the boss will advance the story of the game . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Origins ( 1980s – 1996 ) = = = 
 The origins of the survival horror game can be traced back to earlier horror fiction . Archetypes have been linked to the books of H. P. Lovecraft , which include investigative narratives , or journeys through the depths . Comparisons have been made between Lovecraft 's <unk> Old Ones and the boss encounters seen in many survival horror games . Themes of survival have also been traced to the slasher film subgenre , where the protagonist endures a confrontation with the ultimate antagonist . Another major influence on the genre is Japanese horror , including classical Noh theatre , the books of Edogawa <unk> , and Japanese cinema . The survival horror genre largely draws from both Western ( mainly American ) and Asian ( mainly Japanese ) traditions , with the Western approach to horror generally favouring action @-@ oriented visceral horror while the Japanese approach tends to favour psychological horror . 
 Several games have been retroactively described as survival horror . Nostromo was a sci @-@ fi survival horror game developed by Akira <unk> , a Tokyo University student and Taito contractor , for the PET 2001 . It was ported to the PC @-@ 6001 by <unk> <unk> ( also known as Hiromi Ohba , later joined Game Arts ) , and published by ASCII in 1981 , exclusively for Japan . Inspired by the 1980 stealth game <unk> Shoujo and the 1979 sci @-@ fi horror film Alien , the gameplay of Nostromo involved a player attempting to escape a spaceship while avoiding the sight of an invisible alien , which only becomes visible when appearing in front of the player . The gameplay also involved limited resources , where the player needs to collect certain items in order to escape the ship , and if certain required items are not available in the warehouse , the player is unable to escape and eventually has no choice but be killed getting caught by the alien . 
 Malcolm Evans ' 3D Monster Maze , released for the Sinclair ZX81 in 1982 , is a first @-@ person game without a weapon ; the player cannot fight the enemy , a Tyrannosaurus Rex , so must escape by finding the exit before the monster finds him . The game states its distance and awareness of the player , further raising tension . Edge stated it was about " fear , panic , terror and facing an implacable , relentless foe who ’ s going to get you in the end " and considers it " the original survival horror game " . Retro Gamer stated , " Survival horror may have been a phrase first coined by Resident Evil , but it could ’ ve easily applied to Malcolm Evans ’ massive hit . " Another early example is 1982 Atari 2600 game Haunted House . Gameplay is typical of future survival horror titles , as it emphasizes puzzle @-@ solving and evasive action , rather than violence . The game uses monsters commonly featured in horror fiction , such as bats and ghosts , each of which has unique behaviors . Gameplay also incorporates item collection and inventory management , along with areas that are inaccessible until the appropriate item is found . Because it has several features that have been seen in later survival horror games , some reviewers have retroactively classified this game as the first in the genre . 
 1982 saw the release of another early horror game , Bandai 's Terror House , based on traditional Japanese horror , released as a Bandai LCD <unk> handheld game . It was a solar @-@ powered game with two LCD panels on top of each other to enable impressive scene changes and early pseudo @-@ 3D effects . The amount of ambient light the game received also had an effect on the gaming experience . Another early example of a horror game released that year was Sega 's arcade game Monster Bash , which introduced classic horror @-@ movie monsters , including the likes of Dracula , the Frankenstein monster , and werewolves , helping to lay the foundations for future survival horror games . Its 1986 remake Ghost House had gameplay specifically designed around the horror theme , featuring haunted house stages full of traps and secrets , and enemies that were fast , powerful , and intimidating , forcing players to learn the intricacies of the house and rely on their wits . Another game that has been cited as one of the first horror @-@ themed games is <unk> 's 1983 maze game Ant Attack . 
 In 1985 , Magical Zoo 's The Screamer was a bio @-@ horror RPG released for the NEC PC @-@ 88 that was set in a post @-@ apocalyptic research facility , while the gameplay featured shooter @-@ based combat and permanent death . The latter half of the 1980s saw the release of several other horror @-@ themed games , including Konami 's Castlevania in 1986 , and Sega 's <unk> and Namco 's Splatterhouse in 1988 , though despite the macabre imagery of these games , their gameplay did not diverge much from other action games at the time . Splatterhouse in particular is notable for its large amount of bloodshed and terror , despite being an arcade beat ' em up with very little emphasis on survival . 
 <unk> Sensen : War of the Dead , a 1987 title developed by Fun Factory and published by Victor Music Industries for the MSX2 , PC @-@ 88 and PC Engine platforms , is considered the first true survival horror game by Kevin Gifford ( of GamePro and 1UP ) and John Szczepaniak ( of Retro Gamer and The Escapist ) . Designed by Katsuya Iwamoto , the game was a horror action RPG revolving around a female SWAT member Lila rescuing survivors in an isolated monster @-@ infested town and bringing them to safety in a church . It has open environments like Dragon Quest and real @-@ time side @-@ view battles like Zelda II , though War of the Dead departed from other RPGs with its dark and creepy atmosphere expressed through the storytelling , graphics , and music . The player character has limited ammunition , though the player character can punch or use a knife if out of ammunition . The game also has a limited item inventory and crates to store items , and introduced a day @-@ night cycle ; the player can sleep to recover health , and a record is kept of how many days the player has survived . That same year saw the release of Laplace no Ma , another hybrid of survival horror and RPG , though with more traditional RPG elements such as turn @-@ based combat . It is mostly set in a mansion infested with undead creatures , and the player controls a party of characters with different professions , including a scientist who constructs tools and a journalist who takes pictures . In 1988 , War of the Dead Part 2 for the MSX2 and PC @-@ 88 abandoned the RPG elements of its predecessor , such as random encounters , and instead adopted action @-@ adventure elements from Metal Gear while retaining the horror atmosphere of its predecessor . 
 However , the game often considered the first true survival horror , due to having the most influence on Resident Evil , was the 1989 release Sweet Home , for the Nintendo Entertainment System . The gameplay focused on solving a variety of puzzles using items stored in a limited inventory , while battling or escaping from horrifying creatures , which could lead to permanent death for any of the characters , thus creating tension and an emphasis on survival . It was also the first attempt at creating a scary and frightening storyline within a game , mainly told through scattered diary entries left behind fifty years before the events of the game . Developed by Capcom , the game would become the main inspiration behind their later release Resident Evil , which also borrowed various other elements from the game , such as its mansion setting , " opening door " load screen , death animations , multiple endings depending on which characters survive , dual character paths , individual character skills , limited item management , story told through diary entries and frescos , emphasis on atmosphere , and horrific imagery . The latter prevented its release in the Western world , though its influence was felt through Resident Evil , which was originally intended to be a remake of the game . Some consider Sweet Home to be the first true survival horror game . Travis Fahs of IGN claims Sweet Home is more an RPG despite its influence , and that Project <unk> ( released in the same year as Sweet Home ) more closely embodied genre conventions despite its lack of influence . 
 In 1989 , Electronic Arts published Project <unk> , developed by <unk> . Unlike most other early games in the genre , it featured a science fiction setting inspired by the film Alien , but had gameplay that closely resembled later survival horror games in many ways . Fahs considers it the first to achieve " the kind of fully formed vision of survival horror as we know it today , " citing its balance of action and adventure , limited ammunition , weak weaponry , vulnerable main character , feeling of isolation , storytelling through journals , graphic violence , and use of dynamically triggered music - all of which are characteristic elements of later games in the survival horror genre . Despite this , it is not likely a direct influence on later games in the genre and the similarities are largely an example of parallel thinking . 
 In 1992 , Infogrames released Alone in the Dark , which has been considered a forefather of the genre . The game featured a lone protagonist against hordes of monsters , and made use of traditional adventure game challenges such as puzzle @-@ solving and finding hidden keys to new areas . Graphically , Alone in the Dark utilized static prerendered camera views that were cinematic in nature . Although players had the ability to fight monsters as in action games , players also had the option to evade or block them . Many monsters could not be killed , and thus could only be dealt with using problem @-@ solving abilities . The game also used the mechanism of notes and books as expository devices . Many of these elements were used in later survival horror games , and thus the game is credited with making the survival horror genre possible . 
 In 1994 , Riverhillsoft released the first fully 3D survival horror game , Doctor Hauzer , for the 3DO . Both the player character and the environment are rendered entirely in polygons , while allowing the player to switch the view between three different perspectives : third @-@ person , first @-@ person , and overhead view . In a departure from most other survival horror games before and after it , Doctor Hauzer lacks any enemies ; the main threat is instead the sentient house that the game takes place in , with the player having to survive the house 's traps and solve puzzles . It also uses background music that heightens tension and changes depending on the situation , and the sound of the player character 's echoing footsteps can change depending on the surface ; these would later be used in Resident Evil . The game is today considered a formative step in the creation of the survival horror genre , improving on Alone in the Dark . 
 In 1995 , WARP 's horror adventure game D featured a first @-@ person perspective , CGI full @-@ motion video , gameplay that consisted entirely of puzzle @-@ solving , and taboo content such as cannibalism . The same year , Human Entertainment 's Clock Tower was a survival horror game that employed point @-@ and @-@ click graphic adventure gameplay and a deadly stalker known as Scissorman that chases players throughout the game . The game introduced stealth game elements , and was unique for its lack of combat , with the player only able to run away or outsmart Scissorman in order to survive . It features up to nine different possible endings . 
 The term " survival horror " was first used by Capcom to market their 1996 release , Resident Evil . Resident Evil adopted several features seen in Alone in the Dark , including its cinematic fixed camera angles and some of its puzzle @-@ solving challenges . The control scheme in Resident Evil also became a staple of the genre , and future titles imitated its challenge of rationing very limited resources and items . The game 's commercial success is credited with helping the PlayStation become the dominant game console , and also led to a series of Resident Evil films . Many games have tried to replicate the successful formula seen in Resident Evil , and every subsequent survival horror game has arguably taken a stance in relation to it . 
 = = = Golden age ( 1996 – 2004 ) = = = 
 The success of Resident Evil in 1996 was responsible for its template being used as the basis for a wave of successful survival horror games , many of which were referred to as " Resident Evil clones . " The golden age of survival horror started by Resident Evil reached its peak around the turn of the millennium with Silent Hill , followed by a general decline a few years later . Among the Resident Evil clones at the time , there were several survival horror titles that stood out , such as Clock Tower 2 ( 1996 ) and Clock Tower Ghost Head ( 1998 ) for the PlayStation . These Clock Tower games proved to be hits , capitalizing on the success of Resident Evil while staying true to the graphic @-@ adventure gameplay of the original Clock Tower rather than following the Resident Evil formula . Another survival horror title that differentiated itself was Corpse Party ( 1996 ) , an indie , psychological horror adventure game created using the RPG Maker engine . Much like Clock Tower and later Haunting Ground ( 2005 ) , the player characters in Corpse Party lack any means of defending themselves ; the game also featured up to 20 possible endings . However , the game would not be released in Western markets until 2011 . Another game similar to Clock Tower Series of games and Haunting Ground , which was also inspired by Resident Evil 's Success is the Korean game known as White Day : A Labyrinth named School ( 2001 ) , this game was reportedly so scary that the developers had to release several patches adding multiple difficulty options , the game was slated for localization in 2004 but was cancelled , building on its previous success in Korea and interest , a remake has been developed in 2015 . Riverhillsoft 's <unk> , released in 1996 , is considered one of the first survival horror games to make use of a fully three @-@ dimensional virtual environment , second only to Riverhillsoft 's own Doctor Hauzer in 1994 . The Note in 1997 and <unk> in 1998 experimented with using a real @-@ time 3D first @-@ person perspective rather than pre @-@ rendered backgrounds like Resident Evil . 
 In 1998 , Capcom released the successful sequel Resident Evil 2 , which series creator Shinji Mikami intended to tap into the classic notion of horror as " the ordinary made strange , " thus rather than setting the game in a creepy mansion no one would visit , he wanted to use familiar urban settings transformed by the chaos of a viral outbreak . The game sold over five million copies , proving the popularity of survival horror . That year saw the release of Square 's Parasite Eve , which combined elements from Resident Evil with the RPG gameplay of Final Fantasy . It was followed by a more action @-@ based sequel , Parasite Eve II , in 1999 . In 1998 , <unk> discarded the use of guns in favour of psychic powers that make it difficult to fight more than one enemy at a time . Also in 1998 , Blue Stinger was a fully 3D survival horror for the Dreamcast incorporating action elements from beat ' em up and shooter games . 
 Konami 's Silent Hill , released in 1999 , drew heavily from Resident Evil while using realtime 3D environments in contrast to Resident Evil 's pre @-@ rendered graphics . Silent Hill in particular was praised for moving away from B movie horror elements to the psychological style seen in art house or Japanese horror films , due to the game 's emphasis on a disturbing atmosphere rather than visceral horror . The game also featured stealth elements , making use of the fog to dodge enemies or turning off the flashlight to avoid detection . The original Silent Hill is considered one of the scariest games of all time , and the strong narrative from Silent Hill 2 in 2001 has made the Silent Hill series one of the most influential in the genre . According to IGN , the " golden age of survival horror came to a crescendo " with the release of Silent Hill . 
 Also in 1999 , Capcom released the original Dino Crisis , which was noted for incorporating certain elements from survival horror games . It was followed by a more action @-@ based sequel , Dino Crisis 2 , in 2000 . 
 Fatal Frame from 2001 was a unique entry into the genre , as the player explores a mansion and takes photographs of ghosts in order to defeat them . The Fatal Frame series has since gained a reputation as one of the most distinctive in the genre , with the first game in the series credited as one of the best @-@ written survival horror games ever made , by UGO Networks . Meanwhile , Capcom incorporated shooter elements into several survival horror titles , such as 2000 's Resident Evil Survivor which used both light gun shooter and first @-@ person shooter elements , and 2003 's Resident Evil : Dead Aim which used light gun and third @-@ person shooter elements . 
 Western developers began to return to the survival horror formula . The Thing from 2002 has been called a survival horror game , although it is distinct from other titles in the genre due to its emphasis on action , and the challenge of holding a team together . The 2004 title Doom 3 is sometimes categorized as survival horror , although it is considered an Americanized take on the genre due to the player 's ability to directly confront monsters with weaponry . Thus , it is usually considered a first @-@ person shooter with survival horror elements . Regardless , the genre 's increased popularity led Western developers to incorporate horror elements into action games , rather than follow the Japanese survival style . 
 Overall , the traditional survival horror genre continued to be dominated by Japanese designers and aesthetics . 2002 's Clock Tower 3 eschewed the graphic adventure game formula seen in the original Clock Tower , and embraced full 3D survival horror gameplay . In 2003 , Resident Evil Outbreak introduced a new gameplay element to the genre : online multiplayer and cooperative gameplay . Sony employed Silent Hill director Keiichiro Toyama to develop Siren . The game was released in 2004 , and added unprecedented challenge to the genre by making the player mostly defenseless , thus making it vital to learn the enemy 's patrol routes and hide from them . However , reviewers eventually criticized the traditional Japanese survival horror formula for becoming stagnant . As the console market drifted towards Western @-@ style action games , players became impatient with the limited resources and cumbersome controls seen in Japanese titles such as Resident Evil Code : Veronica and Silent Hill 4 : The Room . 
 = = = Transformation ( 2005 – present ) = = = 
 In 2005 , Resident Evil 4 attempted to redefine the genre by emphasizing reflexes and precision aiming , broadening the gameplay with elements from the wider action genre . Its ambitions paid off , earning the title several Game of the Year awards for 2005 , and the top rank on IGN 's Readers ' Picks Top 99 Games list . However , this also led some reviewers to suggest that the Resident Evil series had abandoned the survival horror genre , by demolishing the genre conventions that it had established . Other major survival horror series followed suit by developing their combat systems to feature more action , such as Silent Hill Homecoming , and the 2008 version of Alone in the Dark . These changes were part of an overall trend among console games to shift towards visceral action gameplay . These changes in gameplay have led some purists to suggest that the genre has deteriorated into the conventions of other action games . Jim Sterling suggests that the genre lost its core gameplay when it improved the combat interface , thus shifting the gameplay away from hiding and running towards direct combat . Leigh Alexander argues that this represents a shift towards more Western horror aesthetics , which emphasize action and gore rather than the psychological experience of Japanese horror . 
 The original genre has persisted in one form or another . The 2005 release of F.E.A.R. was praised for both its atmospheric tension and fast action , successfully combining Japanese horror with cinematic action , while Dead Space from 2008 brought survival horror to a science fiction setting . However , critics argue that these titles represent the continuing trend away from pure survival horror and towards general action . The release of Left 4 Dead in 2008 helped popularize cooperative multiplayer among survival horror games , although it is mostly a first person shooter at its core . Meanwhile , the Fatal Frame series has remained true to the roots of the genre , even as Fatal Frame IV transitioned from the use of fixed cameras to an over @-@ the @-@ shoulder viewpoint . Also in 2009 , Silent Hill made a transition to an over @-@ the @-@ shoulder viewpoint in Silent Hill : Shattered Memories . This Wii effort was , however , considered by most reviewers as a return to form for the series due to several developmental decisions taken by Climax Studios . This included the decision to openly break the fourth wall by psychologically profiling the player , and the decision to remove any weapons from the game , forcing the player to run whenever they see an enemy . 
 Examples of independent survival horror games are the Penumbra series and Amnesia : The Dark Descent by <unk> Games , Cry of Fear by Team <unk> and Slender : The Eight Pages , all of which were praised for creating a horrific setting and atmosphere without the overuse of violence or gore . In 2010 , the cult game Deadly Premonition by Access Games was notable for introducing open world nonlinear gameplay and a comedy horror theme to the genre . Overall , game developers have continued to make and release survival horror games , and the genre continues to grow among independent video game developers . 
 Shinji Mikami , the creator of the Resident Evil franchise , released his new survival horror game The Evil Within , in 2014 . Mikami stated that his goal was to bring survival horror back to its roots ( even though this is his last directorial work ) , as he was disappointed by recent survival horror games for having too much action . 
 = Adolf Hitler = 
 Adolf Hitler ( German : [ <unk> <unk> ] ; 20 April 1889 – 30 April 1945 ) was a German politician who was the leader of the Nazi Party ( <unk> Deutsche <unk> ; NSDAP ) , Chancellor of Germany from 1933 to 1945 , and Führer ( " leader " ) of Nazi Germany from 1934 to 1945 . As dictator of Nazi Germany , he initiated World War II in Europe with the invasion of Poland in September 1939 and was a central figure of the Holocaust . 
 Hitler was born in Austria , then part of Austria @-@ Hungary , and raised near Linz . He moved to Germany in 1913 and was decorated during his service in the German Army in World War I. He joined the German Workers ' Party , the precursor of the NSDAP , in 1919 and became leader of the NSDAP in 1921 . In 1923 , he attempted a coup in Munich to seize power . The failed coup resulted in Hitler 's imprisonment , during which time he dictated the first volume of his autobiography and political manifesto Mein Kampf ( " My Struggle " ) . After his release in 1924 , Hitler gained popular support by attacking the Treaty of Versailles and promoting Pan @-@ Germanism , anti @-@ Semitism , and anti @-@ communism with charismatic oratory and Nazi propaganda . Hitler frequently denounced international capitalism and communism as being part of a Jewish conspiracy . 
 By 1933 , the Nazi Party was the largest elected party in the German Reichstag , which led to Hitler 's appointment as Chancellor on 30 January 1933 . Following fresh elections won by his coalition , the Reichstag passed the Enabling Act , which began the process of transforming the Weimar Republic into Nazi Germany , a one @-@ party dictatorship based on the totalitarian and autocratic ideology of National Socialism . Hitler aimed to eliminate Jews from Germany and establish a New Order to counter what he saw as the injustice of the post @-@ World War I international order dominated by Britain and France . His first six years in power resulted in rapid economic recovery from the Great Depression , the effective abandonment of restrictions imposed on Germany after World War I , and the annexation of territories that were home to millions of ethnic Germans — actions which gave him significant popular support . 
 Hitler sought Lebensraum ( " living space " ) for the German people . His aggressive foreign policy is considered to be the primary cause of the outbreak of World War II in Europe . He directed large @-@ scale rearmament and on 1 September 1939 invaded Poland , resulting in British and French declarations of war on Germany . In June 1941 , Hitler ordered an invasion of the Soviet Union . By the end of 1941 German forces and the European Axis powers occupied most of Europe and North Africa . Failure to defeat the Soviets and the entry of the United States into the war forced Germany onto the defensive and it suffered a series of escalating defeats . In the final days of the war , during the Battle of Berlin in 1945 , Hitler married his long @-@ time lover , Eva Braun . On 30 April 1945 , less than two days later , the two killed themselves to avoid capture by the Red Army , and their corpses were burned . 
 Under Hitler 's leadership and racially motivated ideology , the Nazi regime was responsible for the genocide of at least 5 @.@ 5 million Jews and millions of other victims whom he and his followers deemed Untermenschen ( " sub @-@ humans " ) and socially undesirable . Hitler and the Nazi regime were also responsible for the killing of an estimated 19 @.@ 3 million civilians and prisoners of war . In addition , 29 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the European Theatre of World War II . The number of civilians killed during the Second World War was unprecedented in warfare , and constitutes the deadliest conflict in human history .

 Hitler 's father Alois Hitler , Sr. ( 1837 – 1903 ) was the illegitimate child of Maria Anna <unk> . The baptismal register did not show the name of his father , and Alois initially bore his mother 's surname <unk> . In 1842 , Johann Georg Hiedler married Alois 's mother Maria Anna . Alois was brought up in the family of Hiedler 's brother , Johann Nepomuk Hiedler . In 1876 , Alois was legitimated and the baptismal register changed by a priest to register Johann Georg Hiedler as Alois 's father ( recorded as " Georg Hitler " ) . Alois then assumed the surname " Hitler " , also spelled as Hiedler , <unk> , or <unk> . The Hitler surname is probably based on " one who lives in a hut " ( German Hütte for " hut " ) . 
 Nazi official Hans Frank suggested that Alois 's mother had been employed as a housekeeper for a Jewish family in Graz , and that the family 's 19 @-@ year @-@ old son Leopold Frankenberger had fathered Alois . No Frankenberger was registered in Graz during that period , and no record has been produced of Leopold Frankenberger 's existence , so historians dismiss the claim that Alois 's father was Jewish . 
 = = = Childhood and education = = = 
 Adolf Hitler was born on 20 April 1889 in Braunau am Inn , a town in Austria @-@ Hungary ( in present @-@ day Austria ) , close to the border with the German Empire . He was one of six children born to Alois Hitler and Klara <unk> ( 1860 – 1907 ) . Three of Hitler 's siblings — Gustav , Ida , and Otto — died in infancy . When Hitler was three , the family moved to Passau , Germany . There he acquired the distinctive lower Bavarian dialect , rather than Austrian German , which marked his speech throughout his life . The family returned to Austria and settled in Leonding in 1894 , and in June 1895 Alois retired to Hafeld , near Lambach , where he farmed and kept bees . Hitler attended Volksschule ( a state @-@ owned school ) in nearby <unk> . 
 The move to Hafeld coincided with the onset of intense father @-@ son conflicts caused by Hitler 's refusal to conform to the strict discipline of his school . Alois Hitler 's farming efforts at Hafeld ended in failure , and in 1897 the family moved to Lambach . The eight @-@ year @-@ old Hitler took singing lessons , sang in the church choir , and even considered becoming a priest . In 1898 the family returned permanently to Leonding . The death of his younger brother Edmund , who died from measles in 1900 , deeply affected Hitler . He changed from a confident , outgoing , conscientious student to a morose , detached boy who constantly fought with his father and teachers . 
 Alois had made a successful career in the customs bureau and wanted his son to follow in his footsteps . Hitler later dramatised an episode from this period when his father took him to visit a customs office , depicting it as an event that gave rise to an unforgiving antagonism between father and son , who were both strong @-@ willed . Ignoring his son 's desire to attend a classical high school and become an artist , Alois sent Hitler to the Realschule in Linz in September 1900 . Hitler rebelled against this decision , and in Mein Kampf stated that he intentionally did poorly in school , hoping that once his father saw " what little progress I was making at the technical school he would let me devote myself to my dream " . 
 Like many Austrian Germans , Hitler began to develop German nationalist ideas from a young age . He expressed loyalty only to Germany , despising the declining Habsburg Monarchy and its rule over an ethnically variegated empire . Hitler and his friends used the greeting " Heil " , and sang the " Deutschlandlied " instead of the Austrian Imperial anthem . 
 After Alois 's sudden death on 3 January 1903 , Hitler 's performance at school deteriorated and his mother allowed him to leave . He enrolled at the Realschule in Steyr in September 1904 , where his behaviour and performance improved . In 1905 , after passing a repeat of the final exam , Hitler left the school without any ambitions for further education or clear plans for a career . 
 = = = Early adulthood in Vienna and Munich = = = 
 From 1905 , Hitler lived a bohemian life in Vienna , financed by orphan 's benefits and support from his mother . He worked as a casual labourer and eventually as a painter , selling watercolours of Vienna 's sights . The Academy of Fine Arts Vienna rejected him in 1907 and again in 1908 , citing " unfitness for painting " . The director recommended that Hitler study architecture , which was also an interest , but he lacked academic credentials as he had not finished secondary school . On 21 December 1907 , his mother died of breast cancer at the age of 47 . Hitler ran out of money and was forced to live in homeless shelters and men 's hostels . 
 At the time Hitler lived there , Vienna was a hotbed of religious prejudice and racism . Fears of being overrun by immigrants from the East were widespread , and the populist mayor Karl Lueger exploited the rhetoric of virulent anti @-@ Semitism for political effect . German nationalism had a widespread following in the <unk> district , where Hitler lived . German nationalist Georg Ritter von Schönerer , who advocated Pan @-@ Germanism , anti @-@ Semitism , anti @-@ Slavism , and anti @-@ Catholicism , was one influence on Hitler . Hitler read local newspapers such as the Deutsches Volksblatt that fanned prejudice and played on Christian fears of being swamped by an influx of eastern Jews . Hitler also read newspapers that published the main thoughts of philosophers and theoreticians such as Darwin , Nietzsche , Le Bon and Schopenhauer . Hostile to what he saw as " Catholic <unk> " , he developed an admiration for Martin Luther . 
 The origin and first expression of Hitler 's anti @-@ Semitism remain a matter of debate . Hitler states in Mein Kampf that he first became an anti @-@ Semite in Vienna . His close friend , August Kubizek , claimed that Hitler was a " confirmed anti @-@ Semite " before he left Linz . Several sources provide strong evidence that Hitler had Jewish friends in his hostel and in other places in Vienna . Historian Richard J. Evans states that " historians now generally agree that his notorious , murderous anti @-@ Semitism emerged well after Germany 's defeat [ in World War I ] , as a product of the paranoid " stab @-@ in @-@ the @-@ back " explanation for the catastrophe " . 
 Hitler received the final part of his father 's estate in May 1913 and moved to Munich . Historians believe he left Vienna to evade conscription into the Austro @-@ Hungarian Army . Hitler later claimed that he did not wish to serve Austria @-@ Hungary because of the mixture of races in its armed forces . After he was deemed unfit for service — he failed his physical exam in Salzburg on 5 February 1914 — he returned to Munich . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 At the outbreak of World War I , Hitler was living in Munich and as an Austrian citizen volunteered to serve in the Bavarian Army . According to a subsequent report by the Bavarian authorities in 1924 , Hitler almost certainly served in the Bavarian Army by error . Posted to the Bavarian Reserve Infantry Regiment 16 ( 1st Company of the List Regiment ) , he served as a dispatch runner on the Western Front in France and Belgium , spending nearly half his time at the regimental headquarters in <unk> @-@ en @-@ <unk> , well behind the front lines . He was present at the First Battle of Ypres , the Battle of the Somme , the Battle of Arras , and the Battle of Passchendaele , and was wounded at the Somme . He was decorated for bravery , receiving the Iron Cross , Second Class , in 1914 . On a recommendation by Lieutenant Hugo Gutmann , Hitler 's Jewish superior , he received the Iron Cross , First Class on 4 August 1918 , a decoration rarely awarded to one of Hitler 's Gefreiter rank . He received the Black Wound Badge on 18 May 1918 . 
 During his service at headquarters , Hitler pursued his artwork , drawing cartoons and instructions for an army newspaper . During the Battle of the Somme in October 1916 , he was wounded in the left thigh when a shell exploded in the dispatch runners ' dugout . Hitler spent almost two months in hospital at <unk> , returning to his regiment on 5 March 1917 . On 15 October 1918 , he was temporarily blinded in a mustard gas attack and was hospitalised in <unk> . While there , Hitler learnt of Germany 's defeat , and — by his own account — upon receiving this news , he suffered a second bout of blindness . 
 Hitler described the war as " the greatest of all experiences " , and was praised by his commanding officers for his bravery . His wartime experience reinforced his German patriotism and he was shocked by Germany 's capitulation in November 1918 . His bitterness over the collapse of the war effort began to shape his ideology . Like other German nationalists , he believed the <unk> ( stab @-@ in @-@ the @-@ back myth ) , which claimed that the German army , " undefeated in the field " , had been " stabbed in the back " on the home front by civilian leaders and Marxists , later dubbed the " November criminals " . 
 The Treaty of Versailles stipulated that Germany must relinquish several of its territories and <unk> the Rhineland . The treaty imposed economic sanctions and levied heavy reparations on the country . Many Germans saw the treaty as an unjust humiliation — they especially objected to Article 231 , which they interpreted as declaring Germany responsible for the war . The Versailles Treaty and the economic , social , and political conditions in Germany after the war were later exploited by Hitler for political gain . 
 = = Entry into politics = = 
 After World War I , Hitler returned to Munich . With no formal education or career prospects , he remained in the army . In July 1919 he was appointed <unk> ( intelligence agent ) of an <unk> ( reconnaissance commando ) of the Reichswehr , assigned to influence other soldiers and to infiltrate the German Workers ' Party ( DAP ) . While monitoring the activities of the DAP , Hitler was attracted to the founder Anton Drexler 's anti @-@ Semitic , nationalist , anti @-@ capitalist , and anti @-@ Marxist ideas . Drexler favoured a strong active government , a non @-@ Jewish version of socialism , and solidarity among all members of society . Impressed with Hitler 's oratorical skills , Drexler invited him to join the DAP . Hitler accepted on 12 September 1919 , becoming party member 555 ( the party began counting membership at 500 to give the impression they were a much larger party ) . 
 At the DAP , Hitler met Dietrich Eckart , one of the party 's founders and a member of the occult Thule Society . Eckart became Hitler 's mentor , exchanging ideas with him and introducing him to a wide range of Munich society . To increase its appeal , the DAP changed its name to the <unk> Deutsche <unk> ( National Socialist German Workers Party ; NSDAP ) . Hitler designed the party 's banner of a swastika in a white circle on a red background . 
 Hitler was discharged from the army on 31 March 1920 and began working full @-@ time for the NSDAP . The party headquarters was in Munich , a hotbed of anti @-@ government German nationalists determined to crush Marxism and undermine the Weimar Republic . In February 1921 — already highly effective at speaking to large audiences — he spoke to a crowd of over 6 @,@ 000 . To publicise the meeting , two truckloads of party supporters drove around Munich waving swastika flags and distributing leaflets . Hitler soon gained notoriety for his rowdy polemic speeches against the Treaty of Versailles , rival politicians , and especially against Marxists and Jews . 
 In June 1921 , while Hitler and Eckart were on a fundraising trip to Berlin , a mutiny broke out within the NSDAP in Munich . Members of its executive committee wanted to merge with the rival German Socialist Party ( DSP ) . Hitler returned to Munich on 11 July and angrily tendered his resignation . The committee members realised that the resignation of their leading public figure and speaker would mean the end of the party . Hitler announced he would rejoin on the condition that he would replace Drexler as party chairman , and that the party headquarters would remain in Munich . The committee agreed , and he rejoined the party on 26 July as member 3 @,@ 680 . Hitler continued to face some opposition within the NSDAP : Opponents of Hitler in the leadership had Hermann Esser expelled from the party , and they printed 3 @,@ 000 copies of a pamphlet attacking Hitler as a traitor to the party . In the following days , Hitler spoke to several packed houses and defended himself and Esser , to thunderous applause . His strategy proved successful , and at a special party congress on 29 July , he was granted absolute powers as party chairman , replacing Drexler , by a vote of 533 to 1 . 
 Hitler 's vitriolic beer hall speeches began attracting regular audiences . He became adept at using populist themes , including the use of scapegoats , who were blamed for his listeners ' economic hardships . Hitler used personal magnetism and an understanding of crowd psychology to his advantage while engaged in public speaking . Historians have noted the hypnotic effect of his rhetoric on large audiences , and of his eyes in small groups . Alfons Heck , a former member of the Hitler Youth , later recalled : 
 We erupted into a frenzy of nationalistic pride that bordered on hysteria . For minutes on end , we shouted at the top of our lungs , with tears streaming down our faces : Sieg Heil , Sieg Heil , Sieg Heil ! From that moment on , I belonged to Adolf Hitler body and soul . 
 Some visitors who met Hitler privately noted that his appearance and demeanour failed to make a lasting impression . 
 Early followers included Rudolf Hess , former air force ace Hermann Göring , and army captain Ernst Röhm . Röhm became head of the Nazis ' paramilitary organisation , the Sturmabteilung ( SA , " Stormtroopers " ) , which protected meetings and attacked political opponents . A critical influence on Hitler 's thinking during this period was the Aufbau Vereinigung , a conspiratorial group of White Russian exiles and early National Socialists . The group , financed with funds channelled from wealthy industrialists , introduced Hitler to the idea of a Jewish conspiracy , linking international finance with Bolshevism . 
 = = = Beer Hall Putsch = = = 
 In 1923 Hitler enlisted the help of World War I General Erich Ludendorff for an attempted coup known as the " Beer Hall Putsch " . The NSDAP used Italian Fascism as a model for their appearance and policies . Hitler wanted to emulate Benito Mussolini 's " March on Rome " of 1922 by staging his own coup in Bavaria , to be followed by a challenge to the government in Berlin . Hitler and Ludendorff sought the support of <unk> ( state commissioner ) Gustav Ritter von Kahr , Bavaria 's de facto ruler . However , Kahr , along with Police Chief Hans Ritter von <unk> and Reichswehr General Otto von Lossow , wanted to install a nationalist dictatorship without Hitler . 
 On 8 November 1923 Hitler and the SA stormed a public meeting of 3 @,@ 000 people organised by Kahr in the <unk> , a beer hall in Munich . Interrupting Kahr 's speech , he announced that the national revolution had begun and declared the formation of a new government with Ludendorff . Retiring to a back room , Hitler , with handgun drawn , demanded and got the support of Kahr , <unk> , and Lossow . Hitler 's forces initially succeeded in occupying the local Reichswehr and police headquarters , but Kahr and his cohorts quickly withdrew their support . Neither the army nor the state police joined forces with Hitler . The next day , Hitler and his followers marched from the beer hall to the Bavarian War Ministry to overthrow the Bavarian government , but police dispersed them . Sixteen NSDAP members and four police officers were killed in the failed coup . 
 Hitler fled to the home of Ernst Hanfstaengl and by some accounts contemplated suicide . He was depressed but calm when arrested on 11 November 1923 for high treason . His trial before the special People 's Court in Munich began in February 1924 , and Alfred Rosenberg became temporary leader of the NSDAP . On 1 April , Hitler was sentenced to five years ' imprisonment at Landsberg Prison . There , he received friendly treatment from the guards , and he was allowed mail from supporters and regular visits by party comrades . Pardoned by the Bavarian Supreme Court , he was released from jail on 20 December 1924 , against the state prosecutor 's objections . Including time on remand , Hitler served just over one year in prison . 
 While at Landsberg , Hitler dictated most of the first volume of Mein Kampf ( My Struggle ; originally entitled Four and a Half Years of Struggle against Lies , Stupidity , and <unk> ) to his deputy , Rudolf Hess . The book , dedicated to Thule Society member Dietrich Eckart , was an autobiography and exposition of his ideology . The book laid out Hitler 's plans for transforming German society into one based on race . Some passages implied genocide . Published in two volumes in 1925 and 1926 , it sold 228 @,@ 000 copies between 1925 and 1932 . One million copies were sold in 1933 , Hitler 's first year in office . 
 Shortly before Hitler was eligible for parole , the Bavarian government attempted to have him deported back to Austria . The Austrian federal chancellor rejected the request on the specious grounds that his service in the German Army made his Austrian citizenship void . In response , Hitler formally renounced his Austrian citizenship on 7 April 1925 . 
 = = = Rebuilding the NSDAP = = = 
 At the time of Hitler 's release from prison , politics in Germany had become less combative and the economy had improved , limiting Hitler 's opportunities for political agitation . As a result of the failed Beer Hall Putsch , the NSDAP and its affiliated organisations were banned in Bavaria . In a meeting with Prime Minister of Bavaria Heinrich Held on 4 January 1925 , Hitler agreed to respect the authority of the state and promised that he would seek political power only through the democratic process . The meeting paved the way for the ban on the NSDAP to be lifted on 16 February . Hitler was barred from public speaking by the Bavarian authorities , a ban that remained in place until 1927 . To advance his political ambitions in spite of the ban , Hitler appointed Gregor Strasser , Otto Strasser , and Joseph Goebbels to organise and grow the NSDAP in northern Germany . A superb organiser , Gregor Strasser steered a more independent political course , emphasising the socialist elements of the party 's programme . 
 The stock market in the United States crashed on 24 October 1929 . The impact in Germany was dire : millions were thrown out of work and several major banks collapsed . Hitler and the NSDAP prepared to take advantage of the emergency to gain support for their party . They promised to repudiate the Versailles Treaty , strengthen the economy , and provide jobs . 
 = = Rise to power = = 
 = = = Brüning administration = = = 
 The Great Depression provided a political opportunity for Hitler . Germans were ambivalent about the parliamentary republic , which faced challenges from right- and left @-@ wing extremists . The moderate political parties were increasingly unable to stem the tide of extremism , and the German referendum of 1929 helped to elevate Nazi ideology . The elections of September 1930 resulted in the break @-@ up of a grand coalition and its replacement with a minority cabinet . Its leader , chancellor Heinrich Brüning of the Centre Party , governed through emergency decrees from President Paul von Hindenburg . Governance by decree became the new norm and paved the way for authoritarian forms of government . The NSDAP rose from obscurity to win 18 @.@ 3 per cent of the vote and 107 parliamentary seats in the 1930 election , becoming the second @-@ largest party in parliament . 
 Hitler made a prominent appearance at the trial of two Reichswehr officers , Lieutenants Richard <unk> and Hans <unk> , in late 1930 . Both were charged with membership in the NSDAP , at that time illegal for Reichswehr personnel . The prosecution argued that the NSDAP was an extremist party , prompting defence lawyer Hans Frank to call on Hitler to testify . On 25 September 1930 , Hitler testified that his party would pursue political power solely through democratic elections , which won him many supporters in the officer corps . 
 Brüning 's austerity measures brought little economic improvement and were extremely unpopular . Hitler exploited this by targeting his political messages specifically at people who had been affected by the inflation of the 1920s and the Depression , such as farmers , war veterans , and the middle class . 
 Although Hitler had terminated his Austrian citizenship in 1925 , he did not acquire German citizenship for almost seven years . This meant he was stateless , unable to run for public office , and still faced the risk of deportation . On 25 February 1932 , the interior minister of Brunswick , Dietrich <unk> , who was a member of the NSDAP , appointed Hitler as administrator for the state 's delegation to the <unk> in Berlin , making Hitler a citizen of Brunswick , and thus of Germany . 
 In 1932 , Hitler ran against Hindenburg in the presidential elections . A 27 January 1932 speech to the Industry Club in Düsseldorf won him support from many of Germany 's most powerful industrialists . Hindenburg had support from various nationalist , monarchist , Catholic , and republican parties , and some Social Democrats . Hitler used the campaign slogan " Hitler über Deutschland " ( " Hitler over Germany " ) , a reference to his political ambitions and his campaigning by aircraft . He was one of the first politicians to use aircraft travel for political purposes , and utilised it effectively . Hitler came in second in both rounds of the election , garnering more than 35 per cent of the vote in the final election . Although he lost to Hindenburg , this election established Hitler as a strong force in German politics . 
 = = = Appointment as chancellor = = = 
 The absence of an effective government prompted two influential politicians , Franz von Papen and Alfred Hugenberg , along with several other industrialists and businessmen , to write a letter to Hindenburg . The signers urged Hindenburg to appoint Hitler as leader of a government " independent from parliamentary parties " , which could turn into a movement that would " enrapture millions of people " . 
 Hindenburg reluctantly agreed to appoint Hitler as chancellor after two further parliamentary elections — in July and November 1932 — had not resulted in the formation of a majority government . Hitler headed a short @-@ lived coalition government formed by the NSDAP and Hugenberg 's party , the German National People 's Party ( DNVP ) . On 30 January 1933 , the new cabinet was sworn in during a brief ceremony in Hindenburg 's office . The NSDAP gained three posts : Hitler was named chancellor , Wilhelm Frick Minister of the Interior , and Hermann Göring Minister of the Interior for Prussia . Hitler had insisted on the ministerial positions as a way to gain control over the police in much of Germany . 
 = = = Reichstag fire and March elections = = = 
 As chancellor , Hitler worked against attempts by the NSDAP 's opponents to build a majority government . Because of the political stalemate , he asked Hindenburg to again dissolve the Reichstag , and elections were scheduled for early March . On 27 February 1933 , the Reichstag building was set on fire . Göring blamed a communist plot , because Dutch communist Marinus van der Lubbe was found in incriminating circumstances inside the burning building . According to the British historian Sir Ian Kershaw , the consensus of nearly all historians is that van der Lubbe actually set the fire . Others , including William L. Shirer and Alan Bullock , are of the opinion that the NSDAP itself was responsible . At Hitler 's urging , Hindenburg responded with the Reichstag Fire Decree of 28 February , which suspended basic rights and allowed detention without trial . The decree was permitted under Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution , which gave the president the power to take emergency measures to protect public safety and order . Activities of the German Communist Party ( KPD ) were suppressed , and some 4 @,@ 000 communist party members were arrested . 
 In addition to political campaigning , the NSDAP engaged in paramilitary violence and the spread of anti @-@ communist propaganda in the days preceding the election . On election day , 6 March 1933 , the NSDAP 's share of the vote increased to 43 @.@ 9 per cent , and the party acquired the largest number of seats in parliament . Hitler 's party failed to secure an absolute majority , necessitating another coalition with the DNVP . 
 = = = Day of Potsdam and the Enabling Act = = = 
 On 21 March 1933 , the new Reichstag was constituted with an opening ceremony at the Garrison Church in Potsdam . This " Day of Potsdam " was held to demonstrate unity between the Nazi movement and the old Prussian elite and military . Hitler appeared in a morning coat and humbly greeted Hindenburg . 
 To achieve full political control despite not having an absolute majority in parliament , Hitler 's government brought the <unk> ( Enabling Act ) to a vote in the newly elected Reichstag . The Act — officially titled the Gesetz zur <unk> der Not von Volk und Reich ( " Law to Remedy the Distress of People and Reich " ) — gave Hitler 's cabinet the power to enact laws without the consent of the Reichstag for four years . These laws could ( with certain exceptions ) deviate from the constitution . Since it would affect the constitution , the Enabling Act required a two @-@ thirds majority to pass . Leaving nothing to chance , the Nazis used the provisions of the Reichstag Fire Decree to arrest all 81 Communist deputies ( in spite of their virulent campaign against the party , the Nazis had allowed the KPD to contest the election ) and prevent several Social Democrats from attending . 
 On 23 March 1933 , the Reichstag assembled at the Kroll Opera House under turbulent circumstances . Ranks of SA men served as guards inside the building , while large groups outside opposing the proposed legislation shouted slogans and threats towards the arriving members of parliament . The position of the Centre Party , the third largest party in the Reichstag , was decisive . After Hitler verbally promised party leader Ludwig Kaas that Hindenburg would retain his power of veto , Kaas announced the Centre Party would support the Enabling Act . The Act passed by a vote of 441 – 84 , with all parties except the Social Democrats voting in favour . The Enabling Act , along with the Reichstag Fire Decree , transformed Hitler 's government into a de facto legal dictatorship .

 At the risk of appearing to talk nonsense I tell you that the National Socialist movement will go on for 1 @,@ 000 years ! ... Don 't forget how people laughed at me 15 years ago when I declared that one day I would govern Germany . They laugh now , just as foolishly , when I declare that I shall remain in power ! 
 Having achieved full control over the legislative and executive branches of government , Hitler and his allies began to suppress the remaining opposition . The Social Democratic Party was banned and its assets seized . While many trade union delegates were in Berlin for May Day activities , SA stormtroopers demolished union offices around the country . On 2 May 1933 all trade unions were forced to dissolve and their leaders were arrested . Some were sent to concentration camps . The German Labour Front was formed as an umbrella organisation to represent all workers , administrators , and company owners , thus reflecting the concept of national socialism in the spirit of Hitler 's Volksgemeinschaft ( " people 's community " ) . 
 By the end of June , the other parties had been intimidated into disbanding . This included the Nazis ' nominal coalition partner , the DNVP ; with the SA 's help , Hitler forced its leader , Hugenberg , to resign on 29 June . On 14 July 1933 , the NSDAP was declared the only legal political party in Germany . The demands of the SA for more political and military power caused anxiety among military , industrial , and political leaders . In response , Hitler purged the entire SA leadership in the Night of the Long Knives , which took place from 30 June to 2 July 1934 . Hitler targeted Ernst Röhm and other SA leaders who , along with a number of Hitler 's political adversaries ( such as Gregor Strasser and former chancellor Kurt von Schleicher ) , were rounded up , arrested , and shot . While the international community and some Germans were shocked by the murders , many in Germany believed Hitler was restoring order . 
 On 2 August 1934 , Hindenburg died . The previous day , the cabinet had enacted the " Law Concerning the Highest State Office of the Reich " . This law stated that upon Hindenburg 's death , the office of president would be abolished and its powers merged with those of the chancellor . Hitler thus became head of state as well as head of government , and was formally named as Führer und Reichskanzler ( leader and chancellor ) . With this action , Hitler eliminated the last legal remedy by which he could be removed from office . 
 As head of state , Hitler became supreme commander of the armed forces . The traditional loyalty oath of servicemen was altered to affirm loyalty to Hitler personally , by name , rather than to the office of supreme commander or the state . On 19 August , the merger of the presidency with the chancellorship was approved by 90 per cent of the electorate voting in a plebiscite . 
 In early 1938 , Hitler used blackmail to consolidate his hold over the military by instigating the Blomberg – Fritsch Affair . Hitler forced his War Minister , Field Marshal Werner von Blomberg , to resign by using a police dossier that showed that Blomberg 's new wife had a record for prostitution . Army commander Colonel @-@ General Werner von Fritsch was removed after the Schutzstaffel ( SS ) produced allegations that he had engaged in a homosexual relationship . Both men had fallen into disfavour because they objected to Hitler 's demand to make the Wehrmacht ready for war as early as 1938 . Hitler assumed Blomberg 's title of Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief , thus taking personal command of the armed forces . He replaced the Ministry of War with the Oberkommando der Wehrmacht ( Armed Forces High Command : OKW ) , headed by General Wilhelm Keitel . On the same day , sixteen generals were stripped of their commands and 44 more were transferred ; all were suspected of not being sufficiently pro @-@ Nazi . By early February 1938 , twelve more generals had been removed . 
 Hitler took care to give his dictatorship the appearance of legality . Many of his decrees were explicitly based on the Reichstag Fire Decree and hence on Article 48 of the Weimar Constitution . The Reichstag renewed the Enabling Act twice , each time for a four @-@ year period . While elections to the Reichstag were still held ( in 1933 , 1936 , and 1938 ) , voters were presented with a single list of Nazis and pro @-@ Nazi " guests " which carried with well over 90 percent of the vote . These elections were held in far @-@ from @-@ secret conditions ; the Nazis threatened severe reprisals against anyone who didn 't vote or dared to vote no .

 = = = Economy and culture = = = 
 In August 1934 , Hitler appointed Reichsbank President Hjalmar Schacht as Minister of Economics , and in the following year , as Plenipotentiary for War Economy in charge of preparing the economy for war . Reconstruction and rearmament were financed through <unk> bills , printing money , and seizing the assets of people arrested as enemies of the State , including Jews . Unemployment fell from six million in 1932 to one million in 1936 . Hitler oversaw one of the largest infrastructure improvement campaigns in German history , leading to the construction of dams , autobahns , railroads , and other civil works . Wages were slightly lower in the mid to late 1930s compared with wages during the Weimar Republic , while the cost of living increased by 25 per cent . The average work week increased during the shift to a war economy ; by 1939 , the average German was working between 47 and 50 hours a week . 
 Hitler 's government sponsored architecture on an immense scale . Albert Speer , instrumental in implementing Hitler 's classicist reinterpretation of German culture , was placed in charge of the proposed architectural renovations of Berlin . In 1936 , Hitler opened the summer Olympic games in Berlin . 
 = = = Rearmament and new alliances = = = 
 In a meeting with German military leaders on 3 February 1933 , Hitler spoke of " conquest for Lebensraum in the East and its ruthless Germanisation " as his ultimate foreign policy objectives . In March , Prince Bernhard Wilhelm von Bülow , secretary at the <unk> Amt ( Foreign Office ) , issued a statement of major foreign policy aims : Anschluss with Austria , the restoration of Germany 's national borders of 1914 , rejection of military restrictions under the Treaty of Versailles , the return of the former German colonies in Africa , and a German zone of influence in Eastern Europe . Hitler found Bülow 's goals to be too modest . In speeches during this period , he stressed the peaceful goals of his policies and a willingness to work within international agreements . At the first meeting of his cabinet in 1933 , Hitler prioritised military spending over unemployment relief . 
 Germany withdrew from the League of Nations and the World Disarmament Conference in October 1933 . In January 1935 , over 90 per cent of the people of the Saarland , then under League of Nations administration , voted to unite with Germany . That March , Hitler announced an expansion of the Wehrmacht to 600 @,@ 000 members — six times the number permitted by the Versailles Treaty — including development of an air force ( Luftwaffe ) and an increase in the size of the navy ( Kriegsmarine ) . Britain , France , Italy , and the League of Nations condemned these violations of the Treaty , but did nothing to stop it . The Anglo @-@ German Naval Agreement ( <unk> ) of 18 June allowed German tonnage to increase to 35 per cent of that of the British navy . Hitler called the signing of the <unk> " the happiest day of his life " , believing that the agreement marked the beginning of the Anglo @-@ German alliance he had predicted in Mein Kampf . France and Italy were not consulted before the signing , directly undermining the League of Nations and setting the Treaty of Versailles on the path towards irrelevance . 
 Germany reoccupied the demilitarised zone in the Rhineland in March 1936 , in violation of the Versailles Treaty . Hitler also sent troops to Spain to support General Franco during the Spanish Civil War after receiving an appeal for help in July 1936 . At the same time , Hitler continued his efforts to create an Anglo @-@ German alliance . In August 1936 , in response to a growing economic crisis caused by his rearmament efforts , Hitler ordered Göring to implement a Four Year Plan to prepare Germany for war within the next four years . The plan envisaged an all @-@ out struggle between " Judeo @-@ Bolshevism " and German national socialism , which in Hitler 's view required a committed effort of rearmament regardless of the economic costs . 
 Count Galeazzo Ciano , foreign minister of Mussolini 's government , declared an axis between Germany and Italy , and on 25 November , Germany signed the Anti @-@ Comintern Pact with Japan . Britain , China , Italy , and Poland were also invited to join the Anti @-@ Comintern Pact , but only Italy signed in 1937 . Hitler abandoned his plan of an Anglo @-@ German alliance , blaming " inadequate " British leadership . At a meeting in the Reich Chancellery with his foreign ministers and military chiefs that November , Hitler restated his intention of acquiring Lebensraum for the German people . He ordered preparations for war in the East , to begin as early as 1938 and no later than 1943 . In the event of his death , the conference minutes , recorded as the <unk> Memorandum , were to be regarded as his " political testament " . He felt that a severe decline in living standards in Germany as a result of the economic crisis could only be stopped by military aggression aimed at seizing Austria and Czechoslovakia . Hitler urged quick action before Britain and France gained a permanent lead in the arms race . In early 1938 , in the wake of the Blomberg – Fritsch Affair , Hitler asserted control of the military @-@ foreign policy apparatus , dismissing Neurath as foreign minister and appointing himself <unk> Befehlshaber der Wehrmacht ( supreme commander of the armed forces ) . From early 1938 onwards , Hitler was carrying out a foreign policy ultimately aimed at war .

 In February 1938 , on the advice of his newly appointed foreign minister , the strongly pro @-@ Japanese Joachim von Ribbentrop , Hitler ended the Sino @-@ German alliance with the Republic of China to instead enter into an alliance with the more modern and powerful Japan . Hitler announced German recognition of Manchukuo , the Japanese @-@ occupied state in Manchuria , and renounced German claims to their former colonies in the Pacific held by Japan . Hitler ordered an end to arms shipments to China and recalled all German officers working with the Chinese Army . In retaliation , Chinese General Chiang Kai @-@ shek cancelled all Sino @-@ German economic agreements , depriving the Germans of many Chinese raw materials . 
 = = = = Austria and Czechoslovakia = = = = 
 On 12 March 1938 , Hitler announced the unification of Austria with Nazi Germany in the Anschluss . Hitler then turned his attention to the ethnic German population of the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia . 
 On 28 – 29 March 1938 , Hitler held a series of secret meetings in Berlin with Konrad Henlein of the Sudeten <unk> ( Home Front ) , the largest of the ethnic German parties of the Sudetenland . The men agreed that Henlein would demand increased autonomy for Sudeten Germans from the Czechoslovakian government , thus providing a pretext for German military action against Czechoslovakia . In April 1938 Henlein told the foreign minister of Hungary that " whatever the Czech government might offer , he would always raise still higher demands ... he wanted to sabotage an understanding by any means because this was the only method to blow up Czechoslovakia quickly " . In private , Hitler considered the Sudeten issue unimportant ; his real intention was a war of conquest against Czechoslovakia . 
 In April Hitler ordered the OKW to prepare for Fall Grün ( Case Green ) , the code name for an invasion of Czechoslovakia . As a result of intense French and British diplomatic pressure , on 5 September Czechoslovakian President Edvard Beneš unveiled the " Fourth Plan " for constitutional reorganisation of his country , which agreed to most of Henlein 's demands for Sudeten autonomy . Henlein 's <unk> responded to Beneš ' offer by instigating a series of violent clashes with the Czechoslovakian police that led to the declaration of martial law in certain Sudeten districts . 
 Germany was dependent on imported oil ; a confrontation with Britain over the Czechoslovakian dispute could curtail Germany 's oil supplies . This forced Hitler to call off Fall Grün , originally planned for 1 October 1938 . On 29 September Hitler , Neville Chamberlain , Édouard Daladier , and Mussolini attended a one @-@ day conference in Munich that led to the Munich Agreement , which handed over the Sudetenland districts to Germany . 
 Chamberlain was satisfied with the Munich conference , calling the outcome " peace for our time " , while Hitler was angered about the missed opportunity for war in 1938 ; he expressed his disappointment in a speech on 9 October in Saarbrücken . In Hitler 's view , the British @-@ brokered peace , although favourable to the ostensible German demands , was a diplomatic defeat which spurred his intent of limiting British power to pave the way for the eastern expansion of Germany . As a result of the summit , Hitler was selected Time magazine 's Man of the Year for 1938 . 
 In late 1938 and early 1939 , the continuing economic crisis caused by rearmament forced Hitler to make major defence cuts . In his " Export or die " speech of 30 January 1939 , he called for an economic offensive to increase German foreign exchange holdings to pay for raw materials such as high @-@ grade iron needed for military weapons . 
 On 15 March 1939 , in violation of the Munich accord and possibly as a result of the deepening economic crisis requiring additional assets , Hitler ordered the Wehrmacht to invade Prague , and from Prague Castle he proclaimed Bohemia and Moravia a German protectorate . 
 = = = Start of World War II = = = 
 In private discussions in 1939 , Hitler declared Britain the main enemy to be defeated and that Poland 's obliteration was a necessary prelude for that goal . The eastern flank would be secured and land would be added to Germany 's Lebensraum . Offended by the British " guarantee " on 31 March 1939 of Polish independence , he said , " I shall brew them a devil 's drink " . In a speech in Wilhelmshaven for the launch of the battleship Tirpitz on 1 April , he threatened to denounce the Anglo @-@ German Naval Agreement if the British continued to guarantee Polish independence , which he perceived as an " encirclement " policy . Poland was to either become a German satellite state or be neutralised to secure the Reich 's eastern flank and to prevent a possible British blockade . Hitler initially favoured the idea of a satellite state , but upon its rejection by the Polish government , he decided to invade and made this the main foreign policy goal of 1939 . On 3 April , Hitler ordered the military to prepare for Fall Weiss ( " Case White " ) , the plan for invading Poland on 25 August . In a Reichstag speech on 28 April , he renounced both the Anglo @-@ German Naval Agreement and the German – Polish Non @-@ Aggression Pact . Historians such as William Carr , Gerhard Weinberg , and Kershaw have argued that one reason for Hitler 's rush to war was his fear of an early death . 
 Hitler was concerned that a military attack against Poland could result in a premature war with Britain . Hitler 's foreign minister and former Ambassador to London , Joachim von Ribbentrop , assured him that neither Britain nor France would honour their commitments to Poland . Accordingly , on 22 August 1939 Hitler ordered a military mobilisation against Poland . 
 This plan required tacit Soviet support , and the non @-@ aggression pact ( the Molotov – Ribbentrop Pact ) between Germany and the Soviet Union , led by Joseph Stalin , included a secret agreement to partition Poland between the two countries . Contrary to Ribbentrop 's prediction that Britain would sever Anglo @-@ Polish ties , Britain and Poland signed the Anglo @-@ Polish alliance on 25 August 1939 . This , along with news from Italy that Mussolini would not honour the Pact of Steel , prompted Hitler to postpone the attack on Poland from 25 August to 1 September . Hitler unsuccessfully tried to manoeuvre the British into neutrality by offering them a non @-@ aggression guarantee on 25 August ; he then instructed Ribbentrop to present a last @-@ minute peace plan with an impossibly short time limit in an effort to blame the imminent war on British and Polish inaction . 
 On 1 September 1939 , Germany invaded western Poland under the pretext of having been denied claims to the Free City of Danzig and the right to extraterritorial roads across the Polish Corridor , which Germany had ceded under the Versailles Treaty . In response , Britain and France declared war on Germany on 3 September , surprising Hitler and prompting him to angrily ask Ribbentrop , " Now what ? " France and Britain did not act on their declarations immediately , and on 17 September , Soviet forces invaded eastern Poland . 
 The fall of Poland was followed by what contemporary journalists dubbed the " Phoney War " or <unk> ( " sitting war " ) . Hitler instructed the two newly appointed Gauleiters of north @-@ western Poland , Albert Forster of Reichsgau Danzig @-@ West Prussia and Arthur Greiser of Reichsgau Wartheland , to Germanise their areas , with " no questions asked " about how this was accomplished . Whereas Polish citizens in Forster 's area merely had to sign forms stating that they had German blood , Greiser carried out a brutal ethnic cleansing campaign on the Polish population in his purview . Greiser complained that Forster was allowing thousands of Poles to be accepted as " racial " Germans and thus endangered German " racial purity " . Hitler refrained from getting involved . This inaction has been advanced as an example of the theory of " working towards the Führer " : Hitler issued vague instructions and expected his subordinates to work out policies on their own . 
 Another dispute pitched one side represented by Himmler and Greiser , who championed ethnic cleansing in Poland , against another represented by Göring and Hans Frank , governor @-@ general of the General Government territory of occupied Poland , who called for turning Poland into the " granary " of the Reich . On 12 February 1940 , the dispute was initially settled in favour of the Göring – Frank view , which ended the economically disruptive mass expulsions . On 15 May 1940 , Himmler issued a memo entitled " Some Thoughts on the Treatment of Alien Population in the East " , calling for the expulsion of the entire Jewish population of Europe into Africa and reducing the Polish population to a " leaderless class of labourers " . Hitler called Himmler 's memo " good and correct " , and , ignoring Göring and Frank , implemented the Himmler – Greiser policy in Poland . 
 Hitler began a military build @-@ up on Germany 's western border , and in April 1940 , German forces invaded Denmark and Norway . On 9 April , Hitler proclaimed the birth of the Greater Germanic Reich , his vision of a united empire of the Germanic nations of Europe , where the Dutch , Flemish , and Scandinavians were joined into a " racially pure " polity under German leadership . In May 1940 , Germany attacked France , and conquered Luxembourg , the Netherlands , and Belgium . These victories prompted Mussolini to have Italy join forces with Hitler on 10 June . France and Germany signed an armistice on 22 June . Kershaw notes that Hitler 's popularity within Germany – and German support for the war – reached its peak when he returned to Berlin on 6 July from his tour of Paris . Following the unexpected swift victory , Hitler promoted twelve generals to the rank of field marshal during the 1940 Field Marshal Ceremony . 
 Britain , whose troops were forced to evacuate France by sea from Dunkirk , continued to fight alongside other British dominions in the Battle of the Atlantic . Hitler made peace overtures to the new British leader , Winston Churchill , and upon their rejection he ordered a series of aerial attacks on Royal Air Force airbases and radar stations in south @-@ east England . The German Luftwaffe failed to defeat the Royal Air Force in what became known as the Battle of Britain . By the end of October , Hitler realised that air superiority for the invasion of Britain ( in Operation Sea Lion ) could not be achieved , and he ordered nightly air raids on British cities , including London , Plymouth , and Coventry . 
 On 27 September 1940 , the Tripartite Pact was signed in Berlin by Saburō Kurusu of Imperial Japan , Hitler , and Italian foreign minister Ciano , and later expanded to include Hungary , Romania , and Bulgaria , thus yielding the Axis powers . Hitler 's attempt to integrate the Soviet Union into the anti @-@ British bloc failed after inconclusive talks between Hitler and Molotov in Berlin in November , and he ordered preparations for the invasion of the Soviet Union . 
 In the Spring of 1941 , German forces were deployed to North Africa , the Balkans , and the Middle East . In February , German forces arrived in Libya to bolster the Italian presence . In April , Hitler launched the invasion of Yugoslavia , quickly followed by the invasion of Greece . In May , German forces were sent to support Iraqi rebel forces fighting against the British and to invade Crete . 
 = = = Path to defeat = = = 
 On 22 June 1941 , contravening the Hitler – Stalin Non @-@ Aggression Pact of 1939 , 4 – 5 million Axis troops attacked the Soviet Union . This offensive ( codenamed Operation Barbarossa ) was intended to destroy the Soviet Union and seize its natural resources for subsequent aggression against the Western powers . The invasion conquered a huge area , including the Baltic republics , Belarus , and West Ukraine . By early August , Axis troops had advanced 500 km ( 310 mi ) and won the Battle of Smolensk . Hitler ordered Army Group Centre to temporarily halt its advance to Moscow and divert its Panzer groups to aid in the encirclement of Leningrad and Kiev . His generals disagreed with this change , having advanced within 400 km ( 250 mi ) of Moscow , and his decision caused a crisis among the military leadership . The pause provided the Red Army with an opportunity to mobilise fresh reserves ; historian Russel <unk> considers it to be one of the major factors that caused the failure of the Moscow offensive , which was resumed in October 1941 and ended disastrously in December . 
 On 7 December 1941 , Japan attacked the American fleet based at Pearl Harbor , Hawaii . Four days later , Hitler declared war against the United States . 
 On 18 December 1941 , Himmler asked Hitler , " What to do with the Jews of Russia ? " , to which Hitler replied , " als <unk> <unk> " ( " exterminate them as partisans " ) . Israeli historian Yehuda Bauer has commented that the remark is probably as close as historians will ever get to a definitive order from Hitler for the genocide carried out during the Holocaust . 
 In late 1942 , German forces were defeated in the second battle of El Alamein , thwarting Hitler 's plans to seize the Suez Canal and the Middle East . <unk> in his own military expertise following the earlier victories in 1940 , Hitler became distrustful of his Army High Command and began to interfere in military and tactical planning , with damaging consequences . In December 1942 and January 1943 , Hitler 's repeated refusal to allow their withdrawal at the Battle of Stalingrad led to the almost total destruction of the 6th Army . Over 200 @,@ 000 Axis soldiers were killed and 235 @,@ 000 were taken prisoner . Thereafter came a decisive strategic defeat at the Battle of Kursk . Hitler 's military judgement became increasingly erratic , and Germany 's military and economic position deteriorated , as did Hitler 's health . 
 Following the allied invasion of Sicily in 1943 , Mussolini was removed from power by Victor Emmanuel III after a vote of no confidence of the Grand Council . Marshal Pietro Badoglio , placed in charge of the government , soon surrendered to the Allies . Throughout 1943 and 1944 , the Soviet Union steadily forced Hitler 's armies into retreat along the Eastern Front . On 6 June 1944 , the Western Allied armies landed in northern France in one of the largest amphibious operations in history , Operation Overlord . Many German officers concluded that defeat was inevitable and that continuing under Hitler 's leadership would result in the complete destruction of the country . 
 Between 1939 and 1945 , there were many plans to assassinate Hitler , some of which proceeded to significant degrees . The most well known came from within Germany and was at least partly driven by the increasing prospect of a German defeat in the war . In July 1944 , in the 20 July plot , part of Operation Valkyrie , Claus von Stauffenberg planted a bomb in one of Hitler 's headquarters , the Wolf 's Lair at Rastenburg . Hitler narrowly survived because staff officer Heinz Brandt moved the briefcase containing the bomb behind a leg of the heavy conference table , which deflected much of the blast . Later , Hitler ordered savage reprisals resulting in the execution of more than 4 @,@ 900 people . 
 = = = Defeat and death = = = 
 By late 1944 , both the Red Army and the Western Allies were advancing into Germany . Recognising the strength and determination of the Red Army , Hitler decided to use his remaining mobile reserves against the American and British troops , which he perceived as far weaker . On 16 December , he launched the Ardennes Offensive to incite disunity among the Western Allies and perhaps convince them to join his fight against the Soviets . The offensive failed after some temporary successes . With much of Germany in ruins in January 1945 , Hitler spoke on the radio : " However grave as the crisis may be at this moment , it will , despite everything , be mastered by our unalterable will . " Hitler 's hope to negotiate peace with the United States and Britain was encouraged by the death of Franklin D. Roosevelt on 12 April 1945 , but contrary to his expectations , this caused no rift among the Allies . Acting on his view that Germany 's military failures meant it had forfeited its right to survive as a nation , Hitler ordered the destruction of all German industrial infrastructure before it could fall into Allied hands . Minister for Armaments Albert Speer was entrusted with executing this scorched earth policy , but he secretly disobeyed the order . 
 On 20 April , his 56th birthday , Hitler made his last trip from the Führerbunker ( Führer 's shelter ) to the surface . In the ruined garden of the Reich Chancellery , he awarded Iron Crosses to boy soldiers of the Hitler Youth , who were now fighting the Red Army at the front near Berlin . By 21 April , Georgy Zhukov 's 1st Belorussian Front had broken through the defences of General Gotthard Heinrici 's Army Group Vistula during the Battle of the Seelow Heights and advanced to the outskirts of Berlin . In denial about the dire situation , Hitler placed his hopes on the undermanned and under @-@ equipped <unk> Steiner ( Army Detachment Steiner ) , commanded by Waffen SS General Felix Steiner . Hitler ordered Steiner to attack the northern flank of the salient , while the German Ninth Army was ordered to attack northward in a pincer attack . 
 During a military conference on 22 April , Hitler asked about Steiner 's offensive . He was told that the attack had not been launched and that the Soviets had entered Berlin . Hitler asked everyone except Wilhelm Keitel , Alfred Jodl , Hans Krebs , and Wilhelm Burgdorf to leave the room , then launched into a tirade against the treachery and incompetence of his commanders , culminating in his declaration — for the first time — that " everything was lost " . He announced that he would stay in Berlin until the end and then shoot himself . 
 By 23 April the Red Army had surrounded Berlin , and Goebbels made a proclamation urging its citizens to defend the city . That same day , Göring sent a telegram from Berchtesgaden , arguing that since Hitler was isolated in Berlin , Göring should assume leadership of Germany . Göring set a deadline , after which he would consider Hitler incapacitated . Hitler responded by having Göring arrested , and in his last will and testament , written on 29 April , he removed Göring from all government positions . On 28 April Hitler discovered that Himmler , who had left Berlin on 20 April , was trying to negotiate a surrender to the Western Allies . He ordered Himmler 's arrest and had Hermann Fegelein ( Himmler 's SS representative at Hitler 's HQ in Berlin ) shot . 
 After midnight on 29 April , Hitler married Eva Braun in a small civil ceremony in the Führerbunker . After a wedding breakfast with his new wife , Hitler dictated his will to his secretary Traudl Junge . The event was witnessed and documents signed by Krebs , Burgdorf , Goebbels , and Bormann . Later that afternoon , Hitler was informed of the execution of Mussolini , which presumably increased his determination to avoid capture . 
 On 30 April 1945 , when Soviet troops were within a block or two of the Reich Chancellery , Hitler shot himself and Braun bit into a cyanide capsule . Their bodies were carried outside to the bombed @-@ out garden behind the Reich Chancellery , where they were placed in a bomb crater and doused with petrol . The corpses were set on fire as the Red Army shelling continued . Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz and Joseph Goebbels assumed Hitler 's roles as head of state and chancellor respectively . 
 Berlin surrendered on 2 May . Records in the Soviet archives obtained after the fall of the Soviet Union state that the remains of Hitler , Braun , Joseph and Magda Goebbels , the six Goebbels children , General Hans Krebs , and Hitler 's dogs were repeatedly buried and exhumed . On 4 April 1970 , a Soviet KGB team used detailed burial charts to exhume five wooden boxes at the SMERSH facility in Magdeburg . The remains from the boxes were burned , crushed , and scattered into the Biederitz river , a tributary of the Elbe . According to Kershaw , the corpses of Braun and Hitler were fully burned when the Red Army found them , and only a lower jaw with dental work could be identified as Hitler 's remains . 
 = = = The Holocaust = = = 
 If the international Jewish financiers in and outside Europe should succeed in plunging the nations once more into a world war , then the result will not be the <unk> of the earth , and thus the victory of Jewry , but the annihilation of the Jewish race in Europe ! 
 The Holocaust and Germany 's war in the East was based on Hitler 's long @-@ standing view that the Jews were the enemy of the German people and that Lebensraum was needed for Germany 's expansion . He focused on Eastern Europe for this expansion , aiming to defeat Poland and the Soviet Union and then removing or killing the Jews and Slavs . The Generalplan Ost ( General Plan East ) called for deporting the population of occupied Eastern Europe and the Soviet Union to West Siberia , for use as slave labour or to be murdered ; the conquered territories were to be colonised by German or " <unk> " settlers . The goal was to implement this plan after the conquest of the Soviet Union , but when this failed , Hitler moved the plans forward . By January 1942 , he had decided that the Jews , Slavs , and other deportees considered undesirable should be killed . 
 The genocide was ordered by Hitler and organised and executed by Heinrich Himmler and Reinhard Heydrich . The records of the Wannsee Conference , held on 20 January 1942 and led by Heydrich , with fifteen senior Nazi officials participating , provide the clearest evidence of systematic planning for the Holocaust . On 22 February , Hitler was recorded saying , " we shall regain our health only by eliminating the Jews " . Although no direct order from Hitler authorising the mass killings has surfaced , his public speeches , orders to his generals , and the diaries of Nazi officials demonstrate that he conceived and authorised the extermination of European Jewry . He approved the Einsatzgruppen — killing squads that followed the German army through Poland , the Baltic , and the Soviet Union — and was well informed about their activities . By summer 1942 , Auschwitz concentration camp was expanded to accommodate large numbers of deportees for killing or enslavement . Scores of other concentration camps and satellite camps were set up throughout Europe , with several camps devoted exclusively to extermination . 
 Between 1939 and 1945 , the Schutzstaffel ( SS ) , assisted by collaborationist governments and recruits from occupied countries , was responsible for the deaths of at least eleven million people , including 5 @.@ 5 to 6 million Jews ( representing two @-@ thirds of the Jewish population of Europe ) , and between 200 @,@ 000 and 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 Romani people . Deaths took place in concentration and extermination camps , ghettos , and through mass executions . Many victims of the Holocaust were gassed to death , whereas others died of starvation or disease or while working as slave labourers . In addition to eliminating Jews , the Nazis planned to reduce the population of the conquered territories by 30 million people through starvation in an action called the Hunger Plan . Food supplies would be diverted to the German army and German civilians . Cities would be razed and the land allowed to return to forest or resettled by German colonists . Together , the Hunger Plan and Generalplan Ost would have led to the starvation of 80 million people in the Soviet Union . These partially fulfilled plans resulted in the democidal deaths of an estimated 19 @.@ 3 million civilians and prisoners of war . 
 Hitler 's policies resulted in the killing of nearly two million Poles , over three million Soviet prisoners of war , communists and other political opponents , homosexuals , the physically and mentally disabled , Jehovah 's Witnesses , Adventists , and trade unionists . Hitler did not speak publicly about the killings , and seems never to have visited the concentration camps . 
 The Nazis embraced the concept of racial hygiene . On 15 September 1935 , Hitler presented two laws — known as the Nuremberg Laws — to the Reichstag . The laws banned sexual relations and marriages between Aryans and Jews and were later extended to include " Gypsies , Negroes or their bastard offspring " . The laws stripped all non @-@ Aryans of their German citizenship and forbade the employment of non @-@ Jewish women under the age of 45 in Jewish households . Hitler 's early eugenic policies targeted children with physical and developmental disabilities in a programme dubbed Action Brandt , and he later authorised a euthanasia programme for adults with serious mental and physical disabilities , now referred to as Action T4 . 
 = = Leadership style = = 
 Hitler ruled the NSDAP <unk> by asserting the Führerprinzip ( leader principle ) . The principle relied on absolute obedience of all subordinates to their superiors ; thus he viewed the government structure as a pyramid , with himself — the infallible leader — at the apex . Rank in the party was not determined by elections — positions were filled through appointment by those of higher rank , who demanded unquestioning obedience to the will of the leader . Hitler 's leadership style was to give contradictory orders to his subordinates and to place them into positions where their duties and responsibilities overlapped with those of others , to have " the stronger one [ do ] the job " . In this way , Hitler fostered distrust , competition , and infighting among his subordinates to consolidate and maximise his own power . His cabinet never met after 1938 , and he discouraged his ministers from meeting independently . Hitler typically did not give written orders ; instead he communicated verbally , or had them conveyed through his close associate , Martin Bormann . He entrusted Bormann with his paperwork , appointments , and personal finances ; Bormann used his position to control the flow of information and access to Hitler . 
 Hitler dominated his country 's war effort during World War II to a greater extent than any other national leader . He assumed the role of supreme commander of the armed forces during 1938 , and subsequently made all major decisions regarding Germany 's military strategy . His decision to mount a risky series of offensives against Norway , France , and the Low Countries in 1940 against the advice of the military proved successful , though the diplomatic and military strategies he employed in attempts to force the United Kingdom out of the war ended in failure . Hitler deepened his involvement in the war effort by appointing himself commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the Army in December 1941 ; from this point forward he personally directed the war against the Soviet Union , while his military commanders facing the Western Allies retained a degree of autonomy . Hitler 's leadership became increasingly disconnected from reality as the war turned against Germany , with the military 's defensive strategies often hindered by his slow decision making and frequent directives to hold untenable positions . Nevertheless , he continued to believe that only his leadership could deliver victory . In the final months of the war Hitler refused to consider peace negotiations , regarding the complete destruction of Germany as preferable to surrender . The military did not challenge Hitler 's dominance of the war effort , and senior officers generally supported and enacted his decisions . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Hitler 's suicide was likened by contemporaries to a " spell " being broken . Public support for Hitler had collapsed by the time of his death and few Germans mourned his passing ; Kershaw argues that most civilians and military personnel were too busy adjusting to the collapse of the country or fleeing from the fighting to take any interest . According to historian John Toland , National Socialism " burst like a bubble " without its leader . 
 Hitler 's actions and Nazi ideology are almost universally regarded as gravely immoral ; according to Kershaw , " Never in history has such ruination — physical and moral — been associated with the name of one man " . Hitler 's political programme brought about a world war , leaving behind a devastated and impoverished Eastern and Central Europe . Germany itself suffered wholesale destruction , characterised as <unk> Null ( Zero Hour ) . Hitler 's policies inflicted human suffering on an unprecedented scale ; according to R.J. Rummel , the Nazi regime was responsible for the democidal killing of an estimated 19 @.@ 3 million civilians and prisoners of war . In addition , 29 million soldiers and civilians died as a result of military action in the European Theatre of World War II . The number of civilians killed during the Second World War was unprecedented in the history of warfare . Historians , philosophers , and politicians often use the word " evil " to describe the Nazi regime . Many European countries have criminalised both the promotion of Nazism and Holocaust denial . 
 Historian Friedrich <unk> described Hitler as " one of the great examples of the singular and incalculable power of personality in historical life " . English historian Hugh Trevor @-@ Roper saw him as " among the ' terrible <unk> ' of history , the most systematic , the most historical , the most philosophical , and yet the <unk> , cruelest , least magnanimous conqueror the world has ever known " . For the historian John M. Roberts , Hitler 's defeat marked the end of a phase of European history dominated by Germany . In its place emerged the Cold War , a global confrontation between the Western Bloc , dominated by the United States and other NATO nations , and the Eastern Bloc , dominated by the Soviet Union . Historian Sebastian Haffner avers that without Hitler and the displacement of the Jews , the modern nation state of Israel would not exist . He contends that without Hitler , the de @-@ colonisation of former European spheres of influence would have been postponed . Further , Haffner claims that other than Alexander the Great , Hitler had a more significant impact than any other comparable historical figure , in that he too caused a wide range of worldwide changes in a relatively short time span . 
 = = Views on religion = = 
 Hitler was born to a practising Catholic mother and an anticlerical father ; after leaving home Hitler never again attended Mass or received the sacraments . Speer states that Hitler made harsh pronouncements against the church to his political associates and though he never officially left it , he had no attachment to it . He adds that Hitler felt that in the absence of the church the faithful would turn to mysticism , which he considered a step backwards . According to Speer , Hitler believed that either Japanese religious beliefs or Islam would have been a more suitable religion for the Germans than Christianity , with its " meekness and <unk> " . 
 Historian John S. Conway states that Hitler was fundamentally opposed to the Christian churches . According to Bullock , Hitler did not believe in God , was anticlerical , and held Christian ethics in contempt because they contravened his preferred view of " survival of the fittest " . He favoured aspects of Protestantism that suited his own views , and adopted some elements of the Catholic Church 's hierarchical organisation , liturgy , and phraseology in his politics . 
 Hitler viewed the church as an important politically conservative influence on society , and he adopted a strategic relationship with it that " suited his immediate political purposes " . In public , Hitler often praised Christian heritage and German Christian culture , though professing a belief in an " Aryan Jesus " , one who fought against the Jews . Any pro @-@ Christian public rhetoric was at variance with his private statements , which described Christianity as " absurdity " and nonsense founded on lies . 
 According to a U.S. Office of Strategic Services report , " The Nazi Master Plan " , Hitler planned to destroy the influence of Christian churches within the Reich . His eventual goal was the total elimination of Christianity . This goal informed Hitler 's movement early on , but he saw it as inexpedient to express this extreme position publicly . According to Bullock , Hitler wanted to wait until after the war before executing this plan . 
 Speer wrote that Hitler had a negative view of Himmler 's and Alfred Rosenberg 's mystical notions and Himmler 's attempt to <unk> the SS . Hitler was more pragmatic , and his ambitions centred on more practical concerns . 
 = = Health = = 
 Researchers have variously suggested that Hitler suffered from irritable bowel syndrome , skin lesions , irregular heartbeat , coronary sclerosis , Parkinson 's disease , syphilis , giant cell arteritis with temporal arteritis , and tinnitus . In a report prepared for the Office of Strategic Services in 1943 , Walter C. Langer of Harvard University described Hitler as a " neurotic psychopath " . In his 1977 book The Psychopathic God : Adolf Hitler , historian Robert G. L. Waite proposes that Hitler suffered from borderline personality disorder . Historians Henrik Eberle and Hans @-@ Joachim Neumann consider that while Hitler suffered from a number of illnesses including Parkinson 's disease , he did not experience pathological delusions and was always fully aware of , and therefore responsible for , the decisions he was making . Theories about Hitler 's medical condition are difficult to prove , and placing too much weight on them may have the effect of attributing many of the events and consequences of Nazi Germany to the possibly impaired physical health of one individual . Kershaw feels that it is better to take a broader view of German history by examining what social forces led to the Nazi dictatorship and its policies rather than to pursue narrow explanations for the Holocaust and World War II based on only one person . 
 Hitler followed a vegetarian diet . At social events he sometimes gave graphic accounts of the slaughter of animals in an effort to make his dinner guests shun meat . Bormann had a greenhouse constructed near the Berghof ( near Berchtesgaden ) to ensure a steady supply of fresh fruit and vegetables for Hitler throughout the war . Hitler publicly avoided alcohol . He occasionally drank beer and wine in private , but gave up drinking because of weight gain in 1943 . He was a non @-@ smoker for most of his life , but smoked heavily in his youth ( 25 to 40 cigarettes a day ) . He eventually quit , calling the habit " a waste of money " . He encouraged his close associates to quit by offering a gold watch to any who were able to break the habit . Hitler began using amphetamine occasionally after 1937 and became addicted to it in late 1942 . Speer linked this use of amphetamine to Hitler 's increasingly inflexible decision making ( for example , rarely allowing military retreats ) . 
 Prescribed 90 medications during the war years , Hitler took many pills each day for chronic stomach problems and other ailments . He regularly consumed methamphetamine , barbiturates , opiates , and cocaine . He suffered ruptured eardrums as a result of the 20 July plot bomb blast in 1944 , and 200 wood splinters had to be removed from his legs . Newsreel footage of Hitler shows tremors of his hand and a shuffling walk , which began before the war and worsened towards the end of his life . Ernst @-@ Günther Schenck and several other doctors who met Hitler in the last weeks of his life also formed a diagnosis of Parkinson 's disease . 
 = = Family = = 
 Hitler created a public image as a celibate man without a domestic life , dedicated entirely to his political mission and the nation .

 = Horn shark = 
 The horn shark ( Heterodontus francisci ) is a species of bullhead shark , in the family <unk> . It is endemic to the coastal waters off the western coast of North America , from California to the Gulf of California . Young sharks are segregated spatially from the adults , with the former preferring deeper sandy flats and the latter preferring shallower rocky reefs or algal beds . A small species typically measuring 1 m ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) in length , the horn shark can be recognized by a short , blunt head with ridges over its eyes , two high dorsal fins with large spines , and a brown or gray coloration with many small dark spots . 
 Slow @-@ moving , generally solitary predators , horn sharks hunt at night inside small home ranges and retreat to a favored shelter during the day . Their daily activity cycles are controlled by environmental light levels . Adult sharks prey mainly on hard @-@ shelled molluscs , echinoderms , and crustaceans , which they crush between powerful jaws and molar @-@ like teeth , while also feeding opportunistically on a wide variety of other invertebrates and small bony fishes . Juveniles prefer softer @-@ bodied prey such as polychaete worms and sea anemones . The shark extracts its prey from the substrate using suction and , if necessary , levering motions with its body . Reproduction is oviparous , with females laying up to 24 eggs from February to April . After laying , the female picks up the auger @-@ shaped egg cases and wedges them into crevices to protect them from predators . 
 Horn sharks are harmless unless harassed , and are readily maintained in captivity . They are not targeted by either commercial or recreational fisheries , though small numbers are caught as bycatch . In Mexico this species is used for food and fishmeal , and in California its spines are made into jewelry . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) does not yet have enough information to determine the horn shark 's conservation status . It faces few threats off the coast of the United States . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The French biologist Charles Frédéric Girard published the first scientific description of the horn shark under the name <unk> francisci in 1855 , in the Proceedings of the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia . This species was later placed in the genus <unk> , which was eventually synonymized with the genus Heterodontus . The specific epithet francisci is a reference to San Francisco , although the range of the horn shark does not extend that far north . The type specimen from Monterey Bay has since been lost . The scientific name for this species has been given erroneously as Heterodontus californicus . 
 = = Description = = 
 Like other bullhead sharks , the horn shark has a short , wide head with a blunt snout and prominent supraorbital ridges over the eyes . The horn shark 's supraorbital ridges are low and terminate abruptly ; the space between them on top of the head is deeply concave . Each eye lacks a nictating membrane and is followed by a tiny spiracle . The nostrils are split into inflow and outflow openings by a long flap that reaches the mouth . The inflow openings are encircled by a groove , while another groove connects the outflow openings to the mouth . The mouth is small and curved , with prominent furrows at the corners . There are 19 – 26 tooth rows in the upper jaw and 18 – 29 tooth rows in the lower jaw . The teeth at the front of the jaws are small and pointed , with a central cusp flanked by a pair of lateral cusplets ; those at the sides of the jaws are much larger , elongated lengthwise , and molar @-@ like . 
 The body is cylindrical , with two high , somewhat falcate ( sickle @-@ shaped ) dorsal fins bearing stout spines at the front . The fin spines of reef @-@ dwelling horn sharks are shorter than those living in algal habitats , as their spines become worn down on rocks from the sharks ' movements . The first dorsal fin originates over the bases of the large pectoral fins , while the second dorsal fin originates slightly anterior to the free rear tips of the pelvic fins . The caudal fin has a short lower lobe and a long , broad upper lobe with a strong notch near the tip . The horn shark 's dermal denticles are small and smooth , numbering some 200 / cm2 on the back in adults . The dorsal coloration consists of various shades of gray or brown with many small dark spots , though these may be absent in older sharks ; the underside is yellowish . There is a dark patch of small spots below the eye . This species may reach a length of 1 @.@ 2 m ( 3 @.@ 9 ft ) , though most individuals do not exceed 1 m ( 3 @.@ 3 ft ) . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The horn shark inhabits the continental shelf of the eastern Pacific Ocean , occurring off the coasts of California and Baja California from Monterey Bay southward , and in the Gulf of California . Uncommon influxes of warm water northward may bring it as far as San Francisco Bay . There are unconfirmed reports of this species off Ecuador and Peru , which may be misidentifications of other species . 
 For most of the year , horn sharks are most common at a depth of 2 – 11 m ( 6 @.@ 6 – 36 @.@ 1 ft ) . At the onset of winter , they migrate to water deeper than 30 m ( 98 ft ) . This species has been found in caves as deep as 200 m ( 660 ft ) . Juvenile horn sharks between 35 – 48 cm ( 1 @.@ 15 – 1 @.@ 57 ft ) long prefer sandy flats with low vertical relief , in water 40 – 150 m ( 130 – 490 ft ) deep . They often take advantage of large feeding pits excavated by the bat ray ( Myliobatis californica ) for shelter and food . As they mature , horn sharks shift into shallower water and their preferred habitat becomes structurally complex rocky reefs or algae beds . This strongly benthic species seldom ventures more than 2 m ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) above the substrate . 
 The relative abundances of the horn shark and the swellshark ( <unk> <unk> ) , which shares the same habitat , are negatively correlated because horn sharks prefer temperatures warmer than 20 ° C ( 68 ° F ) while swellsharks are more cold @-@ tolerant . At Santa Catalina Island , a 20 @-@ year warming trend has resulted in an increase in the horn shark population and a decrease in the swellshark population . Horn sharks are less common than swellsharks in the northern Channel Islands , where the water is cooler . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 The horn shark is a clumsy , sporadic swimmer that prefers to use its flexible , muscular pectoral fins to push itself along the bottom . It is usually solitary , though small groups have been recorded . During the day , horn sharks rest motionless , hidden inside caves or crevices , or within thick mats of algae , though they remain relatively alert and will swim away quickly if disturbed . After dusk , they roam actively above the reef in search of food . Horn sharks maintain small home ranges of around 1 @,@ 000 m2 ( 11 @,@ 000 sq ft ) , which they may remain faithful to for over a decade , returning to the same shelter every day . The shelter is usually located at the edge of the resident shark 's foraging area . The longest documented movement for an individual horn shark is 16 km ( 9 @.@ 9 mi ) . 
 Unlike most fishes , the daily activity pattern of the horn shark is under exogenous control , meaning that it is regulated by environmental factors rather than by an internal physiological cycle . Observations of captive horn sharks show that the relevant cue is light intensity : the sharks become active immediately after the lights are turned off , and stop as soon as they are turned back on . In one experiment where the sharks were kept in darkness , they remained continuously active for 11 days before slowing , possibly from fatigue . In nature , horn sharks exposed to a bright light at night may stop swimming and sink to the bottom . 
 The horn shark is preyed upon by larger fishes and the northern elephant seal ( Mirounga angustirostris ) , which consumes adults , juveniles , and egg cases . In addition , they are captured and eaten by bald eagles ( Haliaeetus leucocephalus ) at Catalina Island , and large marine snails are able to drill into their egg cases to extract the yolk . The tough skin and spines of this species confer some protection ; a Pacific angelshark ( Squatina californica ) has been filmed engulfing a juvenile horn shark , only to spit it out due to its spines . Known parasites of this species include the tapeworms Acanthobothrium <unk> and Acanthobothrium <unk> , the copepod Trebius <unk> , and the nematode Echinocephalus <unk> , which spends its larval stage inside potential prey such as scallops and sea urchins . 
 = = = Feeding = = = 
 Some 95 % of the adult horn shark 's diet consists of hard @-@ shelled mollusks ( e.g. bivalves and gastropods ) , echinoderms ( e.g. sea urchins ) and crustaceans ( e.g. crabs , shrimp , and isopods ) . To crack their shells , the horn shark generates the highest known bite force relative to its size of any shark , well in excess of other measured species such as the spiny dogfish ( Squalus acanthias ) and the blacktip shark ( Carcharhinus limbatus ) . One study found the average bite force for this species in the wild to be 95 N with a maximum of 135 N , while under experimental conditions sharks could be induced to bite with over 200 N of force . Large horn sharks that feed mainly on sea urchins ( particularly the short @-@ spined purple urchin , <unk> <unk> ) have their teeth and fin spines stained purple . 
 Other prey items of adults include peanut worms , sea stars , cephalopods , and small bony fishes . Juveniles feed primarily on polychaete worms , sea anemones , and small clams , and have been known to " pounce " on anemones to bite off tentacles before they can be retracted . Off southern California , horn sharks are known to take advantage of seasonal opportunities . In the summer , diurnally active fishes , in particular the blacksmith ( <unk> <unk> ) , are especially abundant and are easily captured at night when they lie dormant . In the winter , the sharks scavenge on market squid ( Loligo <unk> ) , which die by the tens of thousands after their mass spawning event . Horn sharks hunt mainly using their sense of smell . Although electroreception certainly plays a role in locating prey , this species has only 148 ampullae of Lorenzini . This is much fewer than in most other sharks , which may have over 2 @,@ 000 . Like other sharks , the horn shark 's teeth are regularly replaced ; it takes 4 weeks for a dropped tooth to be replaced . 
 The horn shark captures prey via suction , created by expanding its buccal cavity . Its labial cartilages are modified so that the mouth can form a tube , facilitating the suction force . Once the prey is drawn into the mouth , it is secured with the sharp front teeth and then ground into pieces by the flat lateral teeth . To extract buried or affixed prey , the horn shark grips it and adopts a vertical posture with the head and pectoral fins against the substrate and the tail arched above . The shark then acts as a lever with its pectoral fins as the fulcrum : with a downward stroke of the tail , it forces its head upwards and pulls the prey loose ; this mode of feeding has not been observed in any other shark . The horn shark is also capable of protruding its upper jaw up to 15 % the length of its head ; this motion takes only 20 milliseconds to accomplish and allows the shark to use its upper jaw like a chisel to dislodge firmly attached prey . 
 = = = Life history = = = 
 Mating in the horn shark occurs in December or January , on a possibly annual reproductive cycle . The male chases the female to indicate interest ; once she is ready both sharks settle on the bottom , where the male grips the female 's pectoral fin in his teeth and inserts one of his claspers into her cloaca . After 30 – 40 minutes of copulation , the pair disengages and the female spins with her snout in the sand for another 30 minutes . From February to April , the females lay a maximum of 24 eggs two at a time once every 11 – 14 days , in water 2 – 13 m ( 6 @.@ 6 – 42 @.@ 7 ft ) deep . The egg case has two flanges spiraling around it , and thus may take the female several hours to deposit . At first the case is soft and light brown , and over a few days it hardens and darkens in color . Not including the flanges , the case measures 10 – 12 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 – 4 @.@ 7 in ) long and 3 – 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 – 1 @.@ 6 in ) wide ; sharks from the Channel Islands produce longer egg cases than those from mainland California , suggesting that they are separate populations . 
 One of the few sharks to exhibit parental care , female horn sharks in the wild pick up their eggs in their mouths and wedge them into crevices . However , in captivity the eggs are simply dropped on the bottom and may later be cannibalized . The eggs hatch in 6 – 10 months ; at emergence the young measure 15 – 17 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 – 6 @.@ 7 in ) long . Newly hatched sharks are provisioned with an internal yolk sac and do not have to feed until they are a month old , though they are capable of feeding and will accept food during this period . Horn sharks grow slowly and at a highly variable rate that does not correspond to their size ; this has frustrated attempts to determine their aging process . Males mature at a length of 56 – 61 cm ( 22 – 24 in ) and females at a length of at least 58 cm ( 23 in ) . Individual sharks have lived to over 12 years old in captivity , and there exists an unconfirmed report of a shark reaching 25 years of age . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 Under normal circumstances , horn sharks are harmless to humans and can readily be approached underwater . However , they can be provoked into biting , and some pugnacious individuals have been known to chase and bite divers after being harassed . These sharks should be handled with care as their fin spines can inflict a painful wound . The horn shark adapts well to captivity and has been maintained and bred in many public aquariums across the United States . 
 The horn shark has no commercial value in California , where it is captured unintentionally in traps and trawls and by recreational anglers . The shark 's hardiness ensures that it can often be returned to the water alive . This species benefits from general restrictions placed on coastal fishing gear by the State of California . The average annual bycatch off California is 1 @,@ 800 kg ( 4 @,@ 000 lb ) , though historically it has varied from 2 @.@ 5 kg ( 5 @.@ 5 lb ) in 1976 to 9 @,@ 500 kg ( 20 @,@ 900 lb ) in 1979 . Divers sometimes kill them for sport or to make jewelry out of their fin spines , which may be the cause of a decline in the numbers of horn sharks in the most intensely dived areas of southern California . Off Mexico , this species is caught incidentally in shrimp trawls and demersal gillnets , and used for human consumption and fishmeal . The expansion of Mexican gillnet fisheries may pose a conservation concern in the future . At present , the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) does not have sufficient information to assess the overall conservation status of this species ; its status in United States waters is likely Least Concern .

He is known in the United States for his oil paintings , which focused predominantly on marine subjects . He is also known for his books on space travel , which were both authored and illustrated by Coggins . Besides his own works , Coggins also provided illustrations for advertisements and magazine covers and articles . 
 During World War II , he served as an artist and correspondent for YANK magazine , capturing and conveying wartime scenes from the front lines . Over the course of his career , Coggins produced more than 1 @,@ 000 paintings and taught art classes for 45 years . He retired in May 2001 and died at his home in Pennsylvania in January 2006 .

 Coggins was born in London , England on July 10 , 1911 , the only child of Ethel May ( née Dobby ) and Sydney George Coggins . Sydney Coggins was Regimental Corporal Major of the First Regiment of Life Guards , the part of the Household Cavalry responsible for guarding the British Monarch ; Jack Coggins was born in his father 's barracks . During World War I , Sydney Coggins served with , and was commissioned by the regiment . After the war , he was appointed regimental Riding Master , but he was retired when the 1st and 2nd Life Guards were amalgamated into a single regiment under the Geddes Axe . A fellow officer , married to an American steel heiress , offered Sydney work as a secretary to his wife , and the Coggins family emigrated to Long Island , New York in 1923 .

 While his father served with the Life Guards Regiment in France during World War I , Coggins and his mother lived with family in Folkestone , Kent . He attended the Imperial Service College , a public school preferred by army families . After moving to New York , Coggins enrolled at Roslyn High School in Roslyn Heights where he found difficulty in adjusting to the difference between military school in England and New York city public school . After graduation from Roslyn in 1928 at age 17 , he enrolled in the New York City Grand Central School of Art and studied under Edmund <unk> , George Pearse Ennis , and Wayman Adams . In the early years , he painted advertising signs to support himself . With a grounding in fine art techniques , Coggins graduated to the Art Students League of New York , where he studied from 1933 to 1934 under noted artist Frank DuMond .

 While a member of the faculty of Hunter College in New York , Coggins met Alma Wood , a fashion and photographic model . They married in 1948 and moved to Pike Township , Berks County , Pennsylvania , where Coggins had bought an old farm . Alma named their home " <unk> , " which , according to Jack , meant absolutely nothing . 
 Coggins taught his wife to paint , and she had success as an artist in her own right under the name Alma Woods . The couple would hold annual joint exhibitions for many years . Alma Coggins assisted her husband in the planning , research and typing of many of his books , and he acknowledged her efforts with book dedications to her . 
 Coggins taught art classes at the Wyomissing Institute of the Arts from 1957 until 2001 , despite being handicapped by the loss of his left eye due to infection after an operation . 
 Coggins was a signature member and Master <unk> of the Pastel Society of America , a Fellow of the American Society of Marine Artists , a member of the American Ordnance Association , the U.S. Naval Institute , and an adviser to the boards of the Philadelphia Maritime Museum and the Reading Public Museum . He died at his home in Berks County , Pennsylvania at the age of 94 and willed his body to medical science . Alma Wood @-@ Coggins died March 4 , 2007 .

 Coggins 's interest in sailing and maritime subjects began in London when he would sail model yachts on Round Pond in Kensington Gardens . This interest developed into a lifelong passion during his teens when he sailed small craft on Hempstead Harbor , near his new home on Long Island . During the early years of World War II , Coggins took a sampling of his war illustrations to Worthen Paxton , the art director of LIFE Magazine , who commissioned Coggins to produce a drawing of an imaginary coastal invasion of England . Coggins was paid $ 250 for that work , a large sum at the time , which paid his rent for five months . Appearing on July 15 , 1940 , this was the first of many war time illustrations for LIFE . Some of Coggins 's works are in the Anne S. K. Brown Military Collection . 
 During the early 1940s , Coggins obtained more work producing war pictures for other magazines , including a series of double @-@ page spreads for the controversial newspaper PM , and illustrations for The Saturday Evening Post . Throughout the war years , most of the output of many large corporations was reserved for materiel production ; however , management were keen to promote their connection to the war effort and keep their name before the buying public until they could resume peacetime sales . Coggins received advertising commissions from such corporations including Elco , Koppers , US Steel , and Westinghouse . He also received commissions from the U.S. War Department for aircraft recognition charts , and he was intrigued to later find these charts used during his army basic training . 
 Because of the quality of his maritime illustrations , Coggins was invited by publisher Doubleday to provide artwork for a children 's book about the U.S. Navy ; the author being Fletcher Pratt , the well known military historian . Coggins was invited to participate in Pratt 's Naval Game , based on a wargame developed by Fred T. Jane involving dozens of tiny wooden ships , built on a scale of one inch to fifty feet . These were spread over the floor of Pratt 's apartment and their maneuvers were calculated via a complex mathematical formula . The result of Pratt and Coggins 's first collaboration , published in 1941 , was Fighting Ships of the U.S. Navy , a volume that described in text and illustrated in full color every class of ship in the Navy . 
 Coggins was called up for Army service , and enlisted on April 8 , 1943 . He was pulled from basic training at Fort Eustis , Virginia before he could complete it to work as an illustrator for YANK magazine . He was originally introduced to the Commanding Officer and Editor of YANK , Colonel Franklin Forsberg , by Fletcher Pratt . On May 20 , 1943 , Coggins commenced work at the head office of YANK in New York , where he worked until his departure for Britain . Jack Coggins became a naturalized citizen of the United States on August 19 , 1943 . 
 Coggins served as an artist for British YANK in London until August 2 , 1945 and was discharged from the U.S. Army on November 3 , 1945 . While in Britain , Coggins spent time on a Royal Navy convoy in the North Sea , witnessed the bombing of Saint @-@ Lô , and flew over Berlin in a Lancaster bomber . He also spent time on a U.S. PT boat patrolling the beaches and made a trip into Brittany with an armored column . Events from all of these sorties were illustrated in YANK magazine in double page spreads . During his time in Britain , Coggins wrote articles on war rockets and the German Navy which were also published in YANK .

 During the late 1940s and early 1950s Coggins 's marine art was featured on covers of Yachting Magazine and other publications , as well as on advertising material , and his science @-@ fiction art illustrated covers for pulp science fiction magazines . These included Galaxy Science Fiction , The Magazine of Fantasy & Science Fiction and Thrilling Wonder Stories . 
 Due to reduced interest in his pre @-@ war work , Coggins applied for a position teaching watercolor at Hunter College . He taught watercolor painting there from 1948 to 1952 . In New York , as a result of his friendship with Fletcher Pratt , Coggins was introduced to the members of the Hydra Club , where he met Judith Merril and L. Ron Hubbard . Coggins was also invited to join Pratt 's Trap Door Spiders club , where he became closely associated with L. Sprague de Camp and Isaac Asimov . The contact with such visionary thinkers complimented his exposure to the German V @-@ 2 rockets in Europe and served to strengthen his growing interest in space travel , rockets , and science fiction . In 1951 and 1952 , Coggins collaborated again with Fletcher Pratt on two classic books : Rockets , Jets , Guided Missiles & Space Ships , and By Space Ship to the Moon . The books were released amidst the great wave of interest in space travel sweeping the United States and the rest of the world in the 1950s , and they were published in several countries and translated into other languages . These books made the prospect of space exploration seem a practical possibility . National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) scientists used the books to demonstrate their ideas to Congressmen when seeking funding for the space program , and there are many NASA scientists today who retain fond memories of the influence the books had on their careers .

 Between 1941 and 1983 , Coggins wrote or illustrated 44 books on a wide range of marine , military , historical and educational themes . Among his more famous works is the 1962 authoring and illustration of Arms and Equipment of the Civil War . Dale E. <unk> , registrar at the Civil War Library and Museum in Philadelphia , described the work as " not about generals or battles but about the things one should know before delving into those areas ... a welcome addition to any Civil War library . " It was republished several times , most recently in 2004 . In 1966 , Coggins wrote and illustrated The Horseman 's Bible , which sold over 500 @,@ 000 copies with a revised edition published in 1984 . In this book Coggins acknowledges his father " whose twenty five years in the cavalry and lifetime interest in horses made his advice invaluable . " Coggins 's last book was Marine Painter 's Guide , which was first published in 1983 . After the book was published , he decided to stop writing to concentrate more on painting . A new edition of Marine Painter 's Guide was published in 2005 by Dover Publications , the publisher of new editions for several of his books .

 Coggins relies on a realistic style that is executed in oils , for which he had a preference . However , he also painted works in water colors and other media . The majority of his paintings have a maritime theme , about which he wrote " It seems strange that with so much of the globe covered by water , so few artists know how to paint it . " His stated preference in art styles was " a direct splashy type of realistic painting " and he admired the New Hope school of Redfield and Garber , with " no liking for ' modern art ' " . A catalog listing over 1000 works has been posthumously compiled by his relatives . A retrospective exhibition and sale of artworks found in Coggins 's home after his death was held at the Wyomissing Institute of the Arts in late 2006 . This consisted of about 300 previously unseen oils , watercolors , and other printed materials . An annual " Jack Coggins award " to be given to a deserving local artist was financed from part of the proceeds from the sale of these works . 
 As of 2001 his paintings are owned by the Philadelphia Maritime Museum , the National Air and Space Museum of the Smithsonian Institution , the U.S. Navy , and the United States Coast Guard , among many other institutions , corporations , and private collectors . His original manuscripts and illustrations are part of The University of Southern Mississippi 's Permanent Collection of outstanding authors and artists .

 = 2011 Minnesota state government shutdown = 
 The 2011 Minnesota state government shutdown was a government shutdown affecting the U.S. state of Minnesota . The shutdown was the result of a fiscal dispute between the Democratic – Farmer – Labor Party ( DFL ) Governor Mark Dayton and the Republican @-@ majority Minnesota Legislature , that was not resolved by the constitutional deadline on June 30 . The Republican caucuses and their leaders demanded bigger spending cuts , and for the budget shortfall to be met without tax increases , while Dayton demanded some tax increases . The shutdown started at midnight on July 1 , and ended after a budget bill was passed and signed on July 20 . 
 During the shutdown all less important parts of the state government , that were not identified as critical services before the shutdown or in several court cases , suspended their operations . Most state government services were identified as critical or otherwise allowed to continue , so as much as 80 percent of state government spending continued . The eventual budget agreement started to form after Governor Dayton announced on July 14 that he would " reluctantly " pass the last proposal of the Republican legislative leadership before the shutdown , but with conditions . The shutdown was disruptive to the government and some Minnesotans , but its ultimate economic impact was minimal . Politically , it could have influenced the Republican electoral defeat in the 2012 state elections , although there were other factors that may have been more important . 
 = = Background = = 
 Going into the 2010 state elections , the Minnesota government faced an approximately $ 5 billion budget shortfall in the coming 2011 – 2013 biennium , left over from the outgoing administration of Republican Governor Tim Pawlenty . The Republican Party claimed that the shortfall was a result of unsustainable increases in spending , and pledged to balance the budget without raising taxes . In the gubernatorial election , former U.S. Senator Mark Dayton campaigned pledging to close the budget deficit by increasing income taxes on the state 's highest earners . 
 The Republicans won control of both houses of the legislature for the first time in decades , while Dayton narrowly defeated Republican candidate Tom Emmer with 44 % of the vote . Many of the newly elected Republican legislators were affiliated with the Tea Party movement and had more anti @-@ government positions than the Republican establishment . Both Dayton and Republican legislators claimed a popular mandate for their positions . 
 Minnesota 's state government cannot operate without appropriations under law , as mandated by the Minnesota Constitution . However , state courts have determined that Priority One and Two Critical Services must continue in the event of a shutdown . Services that must remain uninterrupted to avoid a potential immediate threat to public health or safety are considered Priority One , and some additional services are designated Priority Two . Before the shutdown , a list of priority services was compiled and prepared by Minnesota Management and Budget , based on recommendations from state agencies . 
 Since Minnesota had divided governments for decades before 2010 , a number of past budgets had brought the state close to a shutdown , and there had been one shutdown before in state history . After Governor Pawlenty and the Republican @-@ majority House could not agree on a budget with the DFL @-@ majority Senate in 2005 , the state government went through a nine @-@ day shutdown . 
 = = Preceding budget negotiations = = 
 Governor Dayton formally proposed a state budget on February 15 , calling for $ 37 billion in state spending , necessitating cuts of about 10 percent to most state agencies . Because the state was projected to take in only about $ 32 billion in taxes , the rest of the budget shortfall was covered by increases to income and property taxes for wealthier Minnesotans , as he had promised during his campaign . Meanwhile , Republican legislators , led by House Speaker Kurt Zellers and Senate Majority Leader Amy Koch , demanded the budget be kept below $ 32 billion . 
 As negotiations went on during the legislative session , Dayton suggested compromise budget frameworks ultimately reducing his proposed budget to $ 35 @.@ 8 billion , but insisted that he would go no further and that Republicans were not amenable enough to compromise . The legislature passed budget bills that balanced the budget with significant cuts to social and infrastructure services , rather than raising any taxes . They described their budget as a compromise with the DFL after the state 's revenue forecast was revised upward , as it called for $ 34 billion in state spending increased from $ 32 billion . Dayton claimed that the impasse was the doing of " extreme right @-@ wing " freshman Republican legislators whom he did not talk to , and that he had cordial relationships with Republican leaders . In a statement at the end of the session on May 23 , Dayton said " Here I am in the middle — and they haven 't moved " . Republicans , including Koch and other legislative leaders , consistently insisted they would not accept a budget of over $ 34 billion , citing polls suggesting public opinion was on their side . During the session , the Republican Party held a rally calling for tax cuts at the State Capitol on May 7 . Protesters supporting Dayton 's tax increases and opposed to the Republicans , many from public employee unions , gathered at the capitol multiple times , including at the end of the session . 
 By the day after the regular session ended , Dayton had vetoed all of the budget bills passed by the legislature , and said in a statement that he anticipated a shutdown would occur . Dayton did not call a special session of the legislature to further address the budget during May or June , claiming that the lack of agreement between him and Zellers and Koch would make it unproductive to do so . He remained in contact with legislative leaders , sticking by the $ 35 @.@ 8 billion budget he proposed late in the session , with minor changes . As the end of June approached , Koch urged the governor to call a session to pass a temporary ' lights @-@ on ' bill while a final deal was reached , but he refused to answer this proposal on the grounds that extending the budget 's deadline would not serve the goal of reaching a final agreement . Since the budget impasse had not ended by the end of June 30 , the shutdown began at midnight of June 30 – July 1 , 2011 . 
 = = Shutdown = = 
 At that time the shutdown began , all state government spending and operations not considered to be critical stopped . Suspended state services included driving tests , childcare assistance , senior and disability linkage lines , criminal background checks , and road construction . State government offices , state parks , highway rest areas , and sites run by the Minnesota Historical Society , among others , closed . The commissioner of the Department of Human Services , Lucinda <unk> , said that letters had to be sent to over 580 @,@ 000 households that relied on the department for social services to notify them about the possible shutdown . More critical parts of the state government , including public safety , health care , benefit payments , and care for residents of state facilities continued . Services that were continued during the shutdown could have amounted to as much as 80 percent of state spending . 
 During the first days of the shutdown , many programs requested that their funding continue , especially social service organizations that relied on state funding . To hear their pleas , the courts appointed retired State Supreme Court judge Kathleen <unk> as a special master . Dayton and State Attorney General Lori Swanson also both submitted petitions to the Ramsey County District Court when the shutdown began , asking for the court to clarify whether some programs could continue . Judges Kathleen Gearin and Bruce W. Christopherson issued their rulings on July 7 , finding that some programs could start again , including criminal background checks , public schools , and local government aid . Gearin complained that the governor and legislature should have been responsible for making decisions about which services could stay open . Gearin had previously heard a case from the Minnesota Zoo , which asked to remain open despite the shutdown , and another from the Canterbury Park horse racing track in Shakopee . While both pay for themselves at least during the summer , Gearin determined that only the Zoo was allowed to operate without legislative appropriations , so she allowed the Zoo to open on July 2 but ordered Canterbury Park to remain closed the same day . 
 = = Effects = = 
 During the shutdown , some 19 @,@ 000 state employees were laid off . State and federal government employees in Minnesota lost approximately $ 65 million in wages over the course of the shutdown . Because of court rulings , some of the 36 @,@ 000 state employees who received layoff notices leading up to the shutdown continued or returned to work during the shutdown . Laid @-@ off employees were immediately eligible for unemployment benefits , and continued to receive health insurance , costing the state millions a week . 
 In addition to the costs associated with staff , Minnesota lost some revenue during the shutdown . The Minnesota State Lottery did not sell tickets during the shutdown , which meant the state could have lost about $ 1 @.@ 25 million in revenue daily . Minnesota stopped selling tax stamps for cigarettes , which must be affixed to each pack before sale . The Star Tribune reported that cigarette sales would come to a halt by mid @-@ August if no more tax stamps were issued . The state also stopped issuing liquor purchasing cards , which businesses need in order to purchase liquor from wholesalers . Many stores , bars , and restaurants renewed their liquor purchasing cards before the shutdown . However , the purchasing cards for approximately three hundred establishments expired on the first day of the shutdown , July 1 . Liquor purchasing cards would have continued to expire on the first day of each month . Alcohol brand licenses expired , so <unk> lost their license to sell 39 brands of beer in Minnesota , and had to have them removed from shelves . 
 While public schools remained open during the shutdown , and teachers continued to be paid following Gearin 's ruling , the shutdown interfered with their operations , and would have caused serious problems if it had continued . Teachers could not renew or receive new licenses during the shutdown , creating a backlog , and property tax levy approvals could have been delayed . No fishing , hunting , and boating licenses or new drivers ' licenses were issued during the shutdown . Taxes continued to be due , but tax refunds stopped . 
 Services for state parks stopped , including roads , making them mostly accessible only by foot , and causing a number of problems . An official for the Department of Natural Resources told the Pioneer Press that visitors were relieving themselves on trails in Gooseberry Falls State Park , as the restrooms were closed , and that uncollected garbage attracted bears in Crow Wing State Park . Vandalism occurred at Afton State Park , where the main office was " ransacked " and a group of twelve " ripped off shingles and pieces of deck for firewood , burned additional furniture and wrote messages bragging about breaking in for free " . While many state @-@ run attractions were closed during the shutdown , institutions not part of the state government stayed open . Museums such as the Science Museum of Minnesota reported an increase in visits , as did county parks and attractions in neighboring states . 
 In an arson case at the former home of Governor Dayton near Lake Harriet in Minneapolis , police were " investigating the possibility that someone [ was ] upset over last week 's shutdown " . 
 In total , about $ 48 million in revenue was lost , and over $ 10 million was spent on expenses related to preparing for and recovering from the shutdown . Overall , the shutdown disrupted the state government 's activities , the lives of some Minnesotans ( especially the most vulnerable ) , and private sector work such as road construction , but had minimal impact on the larger economy of the state . 
 = = Budget agreement = = 
 For the first two weeks of the shutdown , there was little progress and neither the governor nor the Republican leaders made proposals accepted by the other side . On July 4 , Republican lawmakers affirmed their commitment to not agree to a budget of over $ 34 billion . Documents leaked after June 30 stated that the Republican leadership included anti @-@ abortion provisions , a voter ID requirement , and a ban on stem cell research during the budget negotiations . Both the Republican legislative leaders and Dayton ( along with DFL legislative leaders ) toured Minnesota to make their case to Minnesotans . The government shutdown ended after Governor Dayton announced on July 14 that he would accept the last Republican offer before the shutdown , albeit with certain conditions . 
 The Republican offer called for an approximately $ 35 billion budget and no tax increases , and relied on delaying the payment of some K @-@ 12 school aid and issuing bonds against future tobacco revenue to cover the remaining gap . It differed from the previous Republican proposals in several provisions , particularly increasing the K @-@ 12 per @-@ student formula by $ 50 per year to cover additional borrowing costs , adding $ 10 million to the University of Minnesota budget to equalize Minnesota State Colleges and Universities cuts , and restoring funding to the Department of Human Rights and the Trade Office . Dayton 's conditions were that measures on social issues such as abortion be dropped from the budget , 15 percent reductions to state employees in all agencies be dropped , and a $ 500 million infrastructure construction bonding bill . 
 When a final agreement was reached with the Republican legislative leadership , Dayton called a special session of the legislature on July 19 . The legislature met on July 20 and passed the budget bills , which were signed the same day by the governor . Most state employees returned to work on July 21 , facing a backlog of unfinished work and new problems in many agencies . After the budget was passed , Dayton said he approached Republicans again after meeting with ordinary citizens — who said they wanted government services to resume and did not care how the shutdown was ended — and because he feared a worse budget deal and unease in the DFL legislative minorities . Zellers said when the deal was finalized that in his view it was " a deal that we can all be disappointed in , but a deal that is done , a budget that was balanced . " His sentiments that a ' balanced ' budget needed to be passed , and that both sides had something to be unhappy about , were echoed by Koch . 
 = = Political influence = = 
 According to a <unk> poll , Minnesotans blamed the Republican legislature more for the shutdown . Overall , 42 % said Republicans in the legislature were more responsible , 21 % said the DFL governor was more responsible , and 22 % volunteered an answer that they were equally to blame . As expected , partisans blamed the other party more ; only 10 % of Republicans blamed the legislature more , and only 2 % of <unk> blamed Dayton more . Following the shutdown , DFL Representative Phyllis Kahn authored a continuing appropriations bill that would prevent government shutdowns in the event of disagreements between the governor and legislature , as she had done in several past sessions . The House commissioned a policy brief from its research department , published in December 2011 , that looked into what such a bill would require . The brief noted that such ideas had been considered before , including after the 2005 shutdown , and had been abandoned . 
 In the state elections of 2012 , during which all members of the legislature ( but not the governor ) were up for election , the shutdown was a major campaign issue . The Republicans lost their majorities in both houses of the legislature , giving the DFL full control of the state government . Kurt Zellers and other Republican legislators said the shutdown probably was one reason for their electoral defeat . However , other national and state issues may have had more of an influence on the result . The presidential race was also on the ballot , as were the proposed Minnesota Marriage Amendment and Voter ID Amendment , which had been put on the ballot by the legislature in 2011 . All of these ballot items increased the turnout of DFL @-@ leaning voters . 
 After winning control of the state legislature , the DFL passed a $ 38 billion budget containing the tax hikes on the wealthy that Dayton had wanted in 2011 . The shutdown still was a political issue in the 2014 elections , when gubernatorial candidates Zellers and Marty Seifert were among the candidates for statewide office who had been Republican legislators during the shutdown . Zellers claimed having " balanced the budget without a tax increase " during the shutdown was his signature accomplishment as speaker , but he was criticised by Republican rivals and DFL leaders alike for the shutdown and for the means by which the budget was balanced . 
 = Hurricane Bret ( 1999 ) = 
 Hurricane Bret was the first of five Category 4 hurricanes that developed during the 1999 Atlantic hurricane season and the first tropical cyclone since Hurricane Jerry in 1989 to make landfall in Texas at hurricane intensity . Forming from a tropical wave on August 18 , Bret slowly organized within weak steering currents in the Bay of Campeche . By August 20 , the storm began to track northward and underwent rapid intensification on August 21 . After this period of strengthening , Bret attained its peak intensity with winds of 145 mph ( 230 km / h ) and a barometric pressure of 944 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 88 inHg ) . Later that day , the storm weakened to a Category 3 hurricane and made landfall on Padre Island , Texas . Shortly thereafter , the storm weakened further , becoming a tropical depression 24 hours after moving inland . The remnants of the storm eventually dissipated early on August 26 over northern Mexico . 
 Along the Texas coastline , Bret threatened several cities , prompting 180 @,@ 000 residents to evacuate . Numerous shelters were opened throughout the region and prisons were evacuated . Several days prior to the storm 's arrival , the NHC issued hurricane watches , and later warnings for areas near the Texas – Mexico border . Several major roads leading to barrier island towns were shut down to prevent residents from crossing bridges during the hurricane . In nearby Mexico , roughly 7 @,@ 000 people left coastal areas in advance of the storm . Officials also set up hundreds of shelters in northern regions of the country in case of major flooding . 
 Bret made landfall in a sparsely populated region , resulting in relatively little damage in comparison to its intensity . Nevertheless , seven people were killed in relation to storm , four in Texas and three in Mexico . Most of the deaths were due to car accidents caused by slippery roads . Upon making landfall , the hurricane produced a maximum storm surge of 8 @.@ 8 ft ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) at Matagorda Island , Texas . Heavy rains produced by Bret peaked at 13 @.@ 18 in ( 335 mm ) in Texas and were estimated over 14 in ( 360 mm ) in Mexico . Numerous homes in the affected regions were damaged or destroyed , leaving roughly 150 people homeless . In all , the storm caused $ 15 million ( 1999 USD ; $ 19 @.@ 7 million 2009 USD ) in damage . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 Hurricane Bret originated from a tropical wave that moved off the west coast of Africa on August 5 . The wave tracked generally westward , interacting with an upper @-@ level low on August 15 in the western Caribbean Sea , and spawned a low pressure area . Convective activity developed around the low , and by August 18 the system was over the Yucatán Peninsula . Later that day , the disturbance emerged into the Bay of Campeche and a Hurricane Hunter reconnaissance mission into the system revealed that it had matured into a tropical depression around 1 : 00 pm CDT ( 1800 UTC ) , the third of the 1999 season . Initially , moderate wind shear prevented the depression from strengthening as it moved slowly and erratically in response to weak steering currents over the system . By August 19 , the wind shear relented , allowing deep convection to develop over the center ; later that day , the National Hurricane Center ( NHC ) upgraded the system to a tropical storm , assigning it the name Bret . A small tropical cyclone , Bret gradually strengthened for several days as it tracked towards the north . By the morning of August 20 , rainbands began to form . 
 By the evening of August 20 , Bret was designated a hurricane following reports of 75 mph ( 120 km / h ) winds during a Hurricane Hunter mission . At around the same time , Bret established a north @-@ northwest track under the influences of a mid @-@ level ridge . The following day , Bret began to undergo rapid intensification , as a well @-@ defined eye developed . On the morning of August 22 , the storm attained its peak intensity as a Category 4 hurricane with winds of 145 mph ( 230 km / h ) and a barometric pressure of 944 mbar ( hPa ; 27 @.@ 88 inHg ) . Shortly thereafter , an upper @-@ level trough to the west of the storm began to erode its cloud pattern . 
 Late on August 22 , Bret turned northwestward in response to a mid @-@ tropospheric ridge over the Gulf of Mexico and a mid @-@ tropospheric circulation over the Rio Grande Valley . Several hours before landfall , the hurricane weakened to Category 3 intensity and its forward motion slowed . At around 7 : 00 pm CDT ( 0000 UTC ; August 23 ) , Hurricane Bret passed over Padre Island , Texas , with winds of 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) and a barometric pressure of 951 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 08 inHg ) , which marked its landfall . The hurricane rapidly weakened upon moving inland , and roughly 12 hours after landfall , Bret weakened to a tropical storm . It further degenerated into a tropical depression by the evening of August 23 . The remnants of Bret persisted until August 26 , at which time they dissipated over the mountains of northern Mexico .

 On August 21 , when Bret was first expected to approach the Texas coastline , the NHC issued a hurricane watch for coastal areas between the border of Mexico and Baffin Bay , Texas . Hours later , the watch was upgraded to a warning as the storm intensified and posed a more direct threat to the area . A tropical storm warning and hurricane watch were subsequently posted from Baffin Bay northward to Port Aransas . The following day , the hurricane warning was extended to include locations through Port O 'Connor and the advisories were extended to Freeport . As Bret neared landfall , the hurricane watch between Port O 'Connor and Freeport was discontinued . The hurricane warning for Port Aransas to Port O 'Connor was discontinued hours after Bret made landfall and began to weaken . By late August 23 , all watches and warnings in relation to the hurricane were discontinued . 
 By August 22 , city officials in Corpus Christi , Texas declared a state of emergency as Bret was considered a significant threat to the region . Tens of thousands of residents were urged to evacuate coastal areas and seek refuge in local shelters or with relatives further inland . An estimated 180 @,@ 000 people in the state left their residences ahead of the storm . The Corpus Christi International Airport closed midday on August 22 . Later that day , Texas State Highway 361 and docks in Port Aransas were shut down . Highways throughout the area were congested due to the large @-@ scale evacuations and long lines for gas and emergency items developed . Three schools , two universities and a college were closed on August 23 and remained closed for several days . 
 Eleven shelters were opened in the San Antonio area , collectively able to accommodate 3 @,@ 525 people . About 325 prisoners were evacuated from a Nueces County jail as the building they were in was deemed unsafe during hurricane conditions . About 1 @,@ 000 sailors working in the area were evacuated to the USS Inchon prior to the storm . Originally , the ship was meant to ride out the storm at sea ; however , inadequate repair work inhibited the ship from leaving port . The ship reportedly had enough supplies to maintain the sailors for roughly 45 days . By 12 : 00 pm CDT on August 22 , Mustang Island and Padre Island were completely evacuated and officials shut down roads leading in and out of the islands to prevent anyone from re @-@ entering them before the area was deemed safe to enter . A strict order against price gouging was put in place by city officials in Corpus Christi . 
 = = = Mexico = = = 
 In Mexico , officials closed 18 ports on the Gulf of Mexico to small- and medium @-@ sized craft in preparation for the storm . In northern Mexico , more than 500 shelters were opened as thousands of residents were advised to evacuate from low @-@ lying areas . The Mexican Army , Red Cross , and firefighters were put on standby to deal with emergency calls during the storm . On August 22 , a state of emergency was declared for Tamaulipas . The following day , at least 120 firefighters were dispatched to Monterrey , Nuevo Leon to swiftly respond to emergencies . The Mexican government emphasized the safety of residents in the city , which was anticipated to bear the brunt of the hurricane . Around 7 @,@ 000 fishermen evacuated coastal regions near the Texas border . In Matamoros an additional 31 shelters were opened . Schools throughout northern Mexico were closed for several days .

 Prior to developing into a tropical depression , the disturbance produced scattered rainfall across the Yucatán Peninsula , locally exceeding 7 in ( 180 mm ) . As the system stalled in the Bay of Campeche , coastal areas received minor rainfall from the outer bands of the system . Although Bret made landfall near the Texas @-@ Mexico border , the small size of the system resulted in limited impacts in Mexico . In Nuevo Leon , an estimated 14 in ( 360 mm ) of rain fell within a 24 @-@ hour span and similar amounts likely fell in nearby Tamaulipas . In Tamaulipas , Nuevo Leon and Coahuila , ten villages were isolated by floodwaters that washed out roads . Ten people , all members of one family , were injured during a head @-@ on collision . In Nogales , heavy rains caused water to accumulate on streets , leading to traffic jams ; high winds also downed power lines . During the evacuation prior to Bret , one person was trampled to death . Following landfall , a man was electrocuted by downed power lines and another drowned in floodwaters . At least 150 families were left homeless following a flash flood in <unk> that inundated most of the town .

 Upon making landfall , Bret produced a storm surge up to 8 @.@ 8 ft ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) on Matagorda Island , Texas . Around Galveston , minor beach erosion was recorded due to large swells produced by the hurricane . Twelve new inlets were created on Padre Island , one of which was large enough to be mistaken as Mansfield Pass . Heavy precipitation , reaching 13 @.@ 18 in ( 335 mm ) in central Kenedy County , was confined to a small area . The lowest barometric pressure recorded overland was at the Brooks County Airport at 976 mbar ( hPa ; 28 @.@ 84 inHg ) . The Aransas River rapidly reached flood stage due to heavy rains and the Rio Grande produced minor flooding close to the Gulf of Mexico . In beaches near Corpus Christi , upwards of 40 ft3 ( 1 @.@ 1 m3 ) of sand was lost . About 24 @.@ 7 acres ( 10 @.@ 0 ha ) of cropland were destroyed by the storm . 
 A damaged electric tower in Kenedy County resulted in power outages for thousands of people . At the height of the storm , an estimated 64 @,@ 000 people were without power in south Texas . Portions of Texas State Highway Loop 281 were submerged in floodwaters , leaving $ 50 @,@ 000 ( 1999 USD ) in damage . Damage in Corpus Christi were estimated at $ 100 @,@ 000 ( 1999 USD ) .

 On August 23 , the Federal Emergency Management Agency ( FEMA ) deployed 717 personnel , mainly from the disaster response team , to the affected regions in the United States . The following day , 564 National Guard troops were deployed in the state . In the days following the storm , many mosquitoes and other insects laid eggs in areas of standing water , causing a large increase in their numbers . Authorities sprayed insecticide to minimize the potential for disease outbreaks . By August 25 , all shelters opened prior to Bret were closed as residents were allowed to return home . On August 26 , President Bill Clinton added the counties of Brooks , Duval , Jim Wells and Webb to the major disaster declaration area . This allowed residents in those counties to receive federal funding . 
 Reconstruction of public facilities , roads , and water pipes received increased funding on September 3 to speed up the program . The following day , twelve disaster recovery centers were opened in the affected counties for residents to apply for federal funding . On September 9 , two more disaster recovery centers were opened for residents in south Texas .

( 2005 ) . It was published and developed by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS handheld game console . Before the game begins , the player must perform a Brain Age Check to determine their brain age , which ranges from 20 to 80 , to determine approximately their brain 's responsiveness . A brain age of 20 , the lowest age that the player can achieve , indicates that the player 's brain is as responsive as that of an average 20 @-@ year @-@ old . After the player is told their initial brain age , they can complete a series of minigames to help improve their brain 's responsiveness , after which they can run Brain Age Check again to determine their updated brain age . 
 Critics were generally favorable towards Brain Age 2 , which received aggregated scores of 77 % from Metacritic and 79 @.@ 04 % from GameRankings .

 Similar to its predecessor , Brain Age 2 is an edutainment video game that offers the player several minigames to play . Before the game begins , the player must create a profile , after which Brain Age Check runs three random tests to determine the player 's brain age , which ranges from 20 to 80 and depends on the player 's test performance . The brain age determines approximately the responsiveness of the player 's brain ; a brain age of 20 , the lowest age that the player can achieve , indicates that the player 's brain is as responsive as that of an average 20 @-@ year @-@ old . Once the player is told their initial brain age , three modes are unlocked : Quick Play , Daily Training , and Sudoku . In Quick Play , the player can practice with any of the available minigames without receiving a score . In Daily Training , the player can perform Brain Age Check to determine their updated brain age . They can also complete one of the available minigames , after which they are given a rating based on their performance . In Daily Training , the player can also play Virus Buster , a simplified version of Dr. Mario ( 1990 ) modified for mobile play . To let the player track their progress , the game saves daily statistics of the player 's performance , which are shown in a graph . In the third mode , Sudoku , the player can solve one of a hundred Sudoku puzzles . 
 All of the minigames in Brain Age 2 are different from those of the original Brain Age . Brain Age 2 contains six minigames : Rock , Paper , Scissors , Serial Subtraction , Symbol Match , Math Recall , Number Memory , and High Number . The game 's Training mode includes the following activities : Sign Finder , Piano Player , Word Blend , Word Scramble , Change Maker , Calendar Count , Memory Sprint , Math Recall , Clock Spin , and Block Count . During their training , the player can collect stamps by completing minigames , and only one stamp can be collected per day . When a certain numbers of stamps are collected , new minigames and features are unlocked .

 At a Nintendo press conference in Tokyo , Japan on October 5 , 2005 , the company announced several games that it would be releasing in 2006 in Japan . The list included Brain Age 2 , with a release date set for December 29 , 2005 . Nintendo later announced that the game would be released in Europe on June 29 , 2007 for € 30 , and in Australia on July 5 , 2007 for A $ 49 @.@ 95 . The American version of Brain Age 2 was first revealed in May 2007 . The game is targeted to casual gamers , similar to its predecessor ; its basic concepts stay the same as in Brain Age , along with the graphics , menu , and presentation . Brain Age 2 also uses the same Sudoku engine , an addition in the original Brain Age that has been applauded for being one of the best handheld Sudoku games available ; Brain Age 2 's rendition of Sudoku introduces 100 new puzzles . All of the minigames in the game are new to the series ; however , some of them are derived from exercises in Brain Age . One of the challenges in the first game , Head Count , requires that the player count how many people are shown on the screen ; after a few seconds , a house falls on top of them , and then several people leave and enter the house . Afterward , the player must write down how many people they think are still in the house . A variation of this game is available in Brain Age 2 , called Memory Sprint , which asks the player to observe a specific sprinter in a race as they pass other sprinters and are passed themselves , and then determine which place they finished in after they cross the finish line . The game 's voice recognition technology has improved since the last game . The only challenge that uses the feature , Rock , Paper , Scissors , requires that the player speak the correct answer into the microphone as soon as possible . 
 Nintendo 's advertising campaign for Brain Age 2 featured several celebrities . The company announced on June 25 , 2007 that Australian actress Nicole Kidman would appear in European television and newspaper advertisements to promote the game . Nintendo chose to feature her because of " her universal appeal to mainstream audiences of all ages and backgrounds , as well as her reputation for being intelligent , entertaining and genuine " . Kidman praised Nintendo 's desire to reach out to new audiences with self @-@ improvement products , and found that playing the game made her feel young . Nintendo also chose professional swimmer Kieren Perkins to promote Brain Age 2 in his native Australia , who commented , " Having used the original Dr Kawashima 's Brain Training game for a while now , I was genuinely looking forward to all of the new ways I could exercise my mind . More Brain Training is the perfect way for me to continue my Brain Training workout , while keeping the activities fresh and interesting . " In the United States , print advertisements and television commercials for the game featured American actress Liv Tyler .

 Brain Age 2 was released by Nintendo for the Nintendo DS in Japan on December 29 , 2005 , in Europe on June 29 , 2007 , in Australia on July 5 , 2007 , and in North America on August 20 , 2007 . A Brain Age 2 Nintendo DS bundle was released in North America on August 21 , 2007 , which included a copy of Brain Age 2 and a Nintendo DS colored crimson on the top and matte black on the bottom . At a Nintendo Conference on October 2 , 2008 , Nintendo 's president Satoru Iwata announced during his keynote address that both games in the Brain Age series were redeveloped as two DSiWare games called Small Brain DSi Training Everyday for Adults Literature Edition and Science Edition . The DSiWare iterations include training modes from the previous two Nintendo DS games , including new ones that take advantage of the Nintendo DSi 's camera . Brain Age 2 was given generally favorable reviews , receiving aggregated scores of 77 % from Metacritic and 79 @.@ 04 % from GameRankings . Praise focused on improvements made on Brain Age , while criticism targeted the game 's inability to consistently understand written and spoken answers . The game was voted IGN 's Reader 's Game of the Month for August 2007 . 
 Remarking that Brain Age 2 uses the same formula as Brain Age " with some different variables thrown in " , Game Informer noted that players ' opinions of the original Brain Age will most likely be similar to how much they appreciate Brain Age 2 . GameZone was excited about the Sudoku portion of the game , which they complimented was " worth the entire game itself and will provide many hours of fun " . They found the daily training and quick play modes " simply addictive " , and appreciated the game 's " simple and easy to use interface " . The video game website IGN felt differently , however , noting that the challenges felt fresh , with the exception of Sudoku . IGN agreed with GameZone on a particular point , however , writing that both the original Brain Age , and Brain Age 2 , have " calm , clean interface [ s ] " . The television series X @-@ Play was intrigued by Brain Age 2 's promise to improve a person 's intelligence . GameSpy called the game " the ideal video game gateway drug " because of its accessibility to a wide variety of people , lack of requirements for special physical dexterity or experience , and regular reward system to motivate the player . They also considered Brain Age 2 a " noble effort towards the betterment of our mental health through a painless training regimen " . Game Revolution complimented the game 's intelligent use of Nintendo DS features , " fun " sound effects , and " competent " handwriting recognition . Singapore 's The Straits Times considered Brain Age 2 a good investment , despite noting that hardcore gamers might find the minigames " gimmicky " . Recognizing that Nintendo intends to use the game to target baby boomers , The Globe and Mail writes that they were tempted to play the game at work and justify it as a self @-@ improvement program . 
 Even though 1UP.com noticed slight improvements in Brain Age 2 , they found that it also introduced new issues . They considered it difficult for the game to understand their writing , and were also displeased with what they perceived as an arrogant tone with Dr. Kawashima , the game 's avatar . Disappointed with the lack of new additions to Brain Age 2 , GamePro asked readers " [ not to ] expect too much more content than new tests and more Sudoku grids " . Nintendo World Report was also unhappy with the game , telling players who were " hoping for an overhaul [ ... ] to wait for the inevitable Brain Age 3 " .

Regarding whether or not brain training games are effective , Graham Lawton of New Scientist wrote , " All things considered , it 's hard not to conclude that brain training has been proven to work — under certain circumstances .

 The Kamloops Blazers of the Western Hockey League ( WHL ) selected Regehr with their first pick , 17th overall , in the 1995 WHL Bantam Draft . He played as a 15 @-@ year @-@ old with the Prince Albert Mintos of the Saskatchewan Midget AAA Hockey League where he was named the team 's top defenceman . He then joined the Blazers for the 1996 – 97 WHL season . Two years later , the Colorado Avalanche drafted him in the first round , 19th overall , at the 1998 NHL Entry Draft . Regehr broke out following the draft , scoring 12 goals and 32 points in 1998 – 99 , and helped the Blazers reach the WHL championship where they lost to the Calgary Hitmen . He was named a Western Conference All @-@ Star by the WHL and a third @-@ team All @-@ Star by the Canadian Hockey League , and represented Canada at the 1999 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships , winning a silver medal . 
 Late in that season , the Calgary Flames dealt all @-@ star forward Theoren Fleury , along with Chris Dingman , to the Avalanche for Rene Corbet , Wade Belak , a draft pick and their choice of a prospect from a list provided by Colorado . Impressed with his defensive potential , the Flames later chose Regehr to complete that trade . His professional career nearly ended before it started , as he was seriously injured in an automobile accident near Saskatoon , Saskatchewan on July 4 , 1999 . Regehr , who was driving home from a summer trip with his elder brother <unk> ( Ronald ) and two female friends , was struck head @-@ on by another vehicle that crossed into his path . He suffered two broken legs in the crash that killed two people in the other vehicle . Doctors initially feared that he would never play hockey again .

 Following operations to repair the damage to Regehr 's legs , doctors gained optimism , but expected he would be unable to skate before the end of the year . He far exceeded doctors ' expectations ; he was skating by the beginning of September and was back playing hockey less than four months following the accident . He played a five game conditioning stint with the Saint John Flames of the American Hockey League in late October before being recalled by the Flames on October 28 , 1999 . That night , he made his NHL debut against the Ottawa Senators and was praised by his coach , Brian Sutter , for playing a mistake free game . He scored his first NHL goal on November 10 against the San Jose Sharks . Regehr played 57 games for the Flames in 1999 – 2000 , scoring five goals and 12 points . He was the Flames nominee for the Bill Masterton Memorial Trophy , which recognizes perseverance , sportsmanship and dedication to hockey . At the age of 19 , he was the youngest nominee in NHL history . The Flames also presented him with the Ralph T. Scurfield Humanitarian Award in honour of his perseverance . 
 Regehr struggled in 2001 – 02 , finishing with a team worst − 24 plus / minus while occasionally being left out of the lineup as a healthy scratch . Unhappy with his season , he focused on improving his game . He overcame rib , abdominal and wrist injuries in 2002 – 03 to establish himself as a top defender with the team and earned a second Masterton Trophy nomination for his dedication . The Flames rewarded him with a five @-@ year contract extension prior to the 2003 – 04 season . They also named him an alternate captain , a position he continuously held for the remainder of his stay in Calgary . 
 Not known for his offensive ability , Regehr ended a 100 @-@ game goal scoring drought early in the season , finishing with four for the season . He set a career high with 18 points , and was a key player in the Flames improbable run to the 2004 Stanley Cup Finals facing top opposition players . He played the final two games of the Stanley Cup Final despite tearing ligaments in his foot in game five . His performance in the post season earned him the praise of his opponents . 
 While the 2004 – 05 season was cancelled due to a labour dispute , Regehr played in a European charity tour that saw NHL players form a " Worldstars " team that played ten games in seven countries in December 2004 . While he enjoyed the tour , Regehr stated that he was not interested in joining the many other NHL players who signed on with European teams during the lockout . He was also critical of the position of the league in the lockout , and took on a greater role within the National Hockey League Players Association ( NHLPA ) when he succeeded Jarome Iginla as the Flames player representative following the lockout . 
 While the NHL returned to action in 2005 – 06 , he missed the first month of the season after suffering a knee injury in a pre @-@ season game . Doctors considered Regehr fortunate , believing that a knee brace he had been wearing prevented a more severe injury that would have seen him miss up to six months . Despite missing 14 games , he set career highs in goals ( 6 ) , assists ( 20 ) and points ( 26 ) . He continued to quietly lead the Flames defence and earned a spot on the Canadian Olympic team in 2006 . Regehr briefly played with his brother , Richie , who made his NHL debut with the Flames on December 29 , 2005 . He played the full season in 2006 – 07 , including his 500th career game on March 15 , 2007 , against the Dallas Stars and scored his 100th career point on March 31 against the Vancouver Canucks . However , he was again forced out of the lineup due to a knee injury after only one game in the 2007 Stanley Cup Playoffs . 
 Following the season , the Flames signed Regehr to another five @-@ year contract extension worth a total of US $ 20 @-@ million . The deal was considered to be worth less than he could have gotten as an unrestricted free agent the following year , but he chose to take less to stay in a city his family enjoyed and on a team he felt was competitive . Regehr played all 82 games for the Flames in 2007 – 08 despite being hit in the face by the puck in a game , and suffering a deep bruise on his foot while blocking a shot that was initially feared to be a broken bone . 
 Off the ice , Regehr was named to an NHLPA committee formed in 2007 to find a replacement for ousted Executive Director Ted Saskin . The union hired Paul Kelly in October 2007 , however he was controversially dismissed less than two years later . Regehr defended the firing , though he and all player representatives were criticized for how they handled Kelly 's dismissal . 
 Another knee injury ended his 2008 – 09 season after 75 games and left him unavailable for the playoffs . He expressed his frustrations with coach Mike Keenan , who was fired by the team after failing to advance past the first round of the playoffs , criticizing Keenan 's lack of structure and expressing optimism for the team 's chances under a new coach . After failing to score a goal in 2008 – 09 and the first half of the 2009 – 10 season , Regehr scored his first goal in 141 games on January 18 , 2010 , against the San Jose Sharks . He finished with 2 goals and 17 points that season and matched those totals in 2010 – 11 . Upon playing his 804th game late in the season , Regehr surpassed Al MacInnis as the team 's all @-@ time leader in games played by a defenceman .

 After missing the playoffs in the two previous seasons and needing to clear salary cap space to sign Alex Tanguay , the Flames dealt Regehr to the Buffalo Sabres on June 25 , 2011 . He was sent to Buffalo , along with Aleš Kotalík and a second round selection at the 2012 NHL Entry Draft in exchange for Paul Byron and Chris Butler . According to Flames ' general manager Jay Feaster , the deal " surprised " Regehr , who initially was unsure he would waive his no @-@ trade clause and agree to the deal . Regehr accepted the deal after speaking with Sabres ' management . 
 In his first season with Buffalo , 2011 – 12 , Regehr led the Sabres with 172 hits and finished second with 112 blocked shots . His one goal on the season ended another lengthy scoring drought that lasted nearly 11 months . His tenure with the Sabres ended 21 games into the 2012 – 13 season . In the final year of his contract and with Buffalo out of playoff contention , he was dealt to the Los Angeles Kings on April 1 , 2013 , in exchange for two second round draft picks . The Kings acquired Regehr to add a veteran presence and aid the team 's penalty kill . He appeared in 41 games during the season , split between the two teams , and recorded four assists . Shortly after the Kings reached the third round of the 2013 Stanley Cup Playoffs , Regehr and the team agreed to a two @-@ year , $ 6 million contract extension . After the Kings were eliminated from the post @-@ season by the Chicago Blackhawks , Kings ' coach Darryl Sutter revealed he had played the entire playoffs with an elbow injury that required off @-@ season surgery to repair . 
 In the 2013 @-@ 14 NHL season , Regehr begun his 15th year in the NHL , and played his 1,000th game on February 1 , 2014 , against the Philadelphia Flyers . At the 2014 Stanley Cup Playoffs , <unk> only played the first round against the San Jose Sharks before being sidelined with a knee injury . Once the Kings won the 2014 Stanley Cup Finals , captain Dustin Brown finished his victory lap by handing the Stanley Cup to Regehr , thanking the veteran for his off @-@ ice presence . 
 Following the last regular season game for the Kings and the last day of the 2014 – 2015 NHL regular season , Regehr announced that he would retire from professional hockey .

He made his first appearance with the senior team following his rookie season in the NHL , playing six games in the 2000 Men 's World Ice Hockey Championships . His emergence in the 2004 Stanley Cup playoffs earned him consideration for Canada 's entry at the 2004 World Cup of Hockey . He was named to the team by executive director Wayne Gretzky as he looked to bring a younger team to this tournament than played at the 2002 Winter Olympics . The decision worked , as Regehr and the Canadians won the championship .

The album has been certified platinum in Europe for sales of over one million copies , including 900 @,@ 000 copies sold in the UK alone .

 = = Background = = 
 Reality Killed the Video Star was Williams ' first studio album in three years . In that period , he worked with many producers , including Guy Chambers , Soul <unk> , Mark Ronson , and Trevor Horn . However , the British singer confirmed in August 2009 on his official website that the entire album was produced by Trevor Horn , and added that it was recorded in London . 
 Rumours of a new studio album co @-@ written with Chambers had surfaced in early 2007 , along with known commitments required by Williams to complete his EMI contract . British singer @-@ songwriter Laura Critchley commented that she had sung vocals for three songs , and said that the LP would not be released until 2009 . At first it was believed that Williams had reunited with Chambers , but it was later confirmed that the song " Blasphemy " was co @-@ written by the pair during the recording sessions of Williams ' 2002 album Escapology . 
 In February 2009 , it was confirmed that Williams had written material with Soul <unk> , Chambers and Ronson . The singer 's spokesman , Tim Clark , said that the artist was planning to begin recording sessions in March and that the new album would be released in late 2009 . The album was mostly written in Williams ' home studio and was recorded in London . Amongst those who collaborated in the songwriting were Danny Spencer and Kelvin Andrews , Brandon Christy , Craig Russo , Richard Scott and Scott Ralph , Chas Jankel and Fil Eisler . 
 On his official website , Williams wrote that he was working with producer Trevor Horn on his new album ; he described himself as " buzzing " and went on to call the album 's sound " Very , very big " . Williams revealed that the new album would be titled Reality Killed the Video Star , a reference to the song " Video Killed the Radio Star " by Horn 's former band The Buggles . The album was originally planned to be named Il <unk> ( Italian for The Protagonist ) until Williams ' management told him to change the title as it was " too pretentious " . In July 2009 Williams wrote on his official blog about the album : " My album 's a killer : old Robbie , new Robbie and a Robbie that neither of us have met ... " . The A.V. Club has also reported that during 2007 , Williams had recorded an unreleased experimental album that , he later said , would have amounted to " career suicide " . 
 Before the album 's release , Williams spoke about his hopes for the album : " I want people to feel elated , I want them to dance , I want them to forget about who they are and where they are for 50 minutes – and , within those 50 minutes of forgetting who they are , I also hope people relate to the songs . This is a record that I ’ m very proud of – I think it ’ s fucking brilliant . I want it to be the record that , if people think of Robbie Williams , they go , Yeah , Reality Killed the Video Star . " He also talked about his collaboration with producer Trevor Horn : " He ’ s added something to the record that I haven ’ t had on previous records – his genius " . 
 In the wake of Michael Jackson 's death on 25 June 2009 , Williams was reported to have written and recorded a last minute tribute song to Jackson that would be included on the album . The track , " Morning Sun " , was co @-@ written by James Bond lyricist Don Black . During his BBC Electric Proms concert at The Roundhouse in London on 20 October 2009 Williams said about the song : " I thought it was about Michael Jackson [ ... ] but it 's actually about me again . "

 The British singer @-@ songwriter unveiled the album at an industry playback in London , where EMI UK and Ireland president Andria Vidler hosted the event . Mark Sutherland from Billboard said that the album " marks a return to Williams ' trademark pop sound after 2006 's more experimental – and commercially under @-@ performing – Rudebox " . Sutherland felt that even though the lead single ' Bodies ' , " features a refinement of the more electronic sound debuted on Rudebox , much of the album returns to the fertile , adult pop ground of Williams ' previous smash hit albums Escapology and Intensive Care " . He felt that the album highlights are the " lush ballads ' Morning Sun ' and ' You Know Me ' , the intricate wordplay of ' Blasphemy ' and the 1980s sound of ' Last Days of Disco ' " , while also noting that " a confident @-@ sounding Williams also experiments with some light psychedelia on ' <unk> ' and electronic dance music on the anthemic ' Starstruck ' and ' Difficult for Weirdos ' . " Jude Rogers from The Quietus said that the song " Do You Mind ? " " puts Status Quo , Slade and a gallon of glam @-@ rock in a bottle , shakes it up , and make an interesting , if rather peculiar , froth . " Rogers said that on the track " Starstruck " " Goldfrapp 's Felt Mountain , The Ipcress File soundtrack and the shadow of Broadcast fall over the first ten seconds of this song about our obsession with celebrity " . " <unk> " contains a " peculiar set of lyrics , floating on waves of reverb , sad strings and icy keyboards " Rogers said that " It 's an unshowy meditation the shallowness of fame , with a fantastic , mournful outro . " Mike Diver from BBC Music said that " Bodies " is " A strange brew of string flourishes , rumbling low end , oriental undertones and even an Enigma @-@ style break into Gregorian territory " , Diver also said that " Last Days of Disco " is " reminiscent of Eurythmics " .

 Reality Killed the Video Star received a varied response from music critics . One review <unk> , Metacritic , gave it an average score of 64 / 100 based on its sample of 17 reviews . John Bush from AllMusic gave the album two stars out of five . He praised songs like " Bodies " and " Morning Sun " but felt that many songs " sound rushed and the performances lackluster " . He concluded that the album is " not decidedly worse than 2002 's Escapology , it 's just bad in a different way . Whereas Escapology found Robbie disappearing into his own neuroses , this one is a hopeless mélange of satire and sincerity where , from song to song , neither can immediately be distinguished . " Chris Mincher from The A.V. Club gave the album a C rating stating that : " <unk> examining his personality quirks through decidedly unoriginal , un @-@ quirky pop songs , Williams apparently wants to express his individuality with classic @-@ rock reference points and frustratingly nonsensical novelty tracks . " 
 Mark Sutherland from Billboard gave the album a favourable review . He said that it offers " string @-@ drenched ballads , slick George Michael @-@ style electronic dance @-@ pop , Elvis Costello @-@ esque clever wordplay and the slightly cheesy , supremely catchy MOR pop he made his name with . " Sutherland said that " The end result may not be enough to convince America it 's missing out , but expect this album to bring the already @-@ converted back onboard in droves . " Dave Karger from Entertainment Weekly gave it a B + rating . Karger felt that , although the album " contains fewer knockout potential hits than past efforts " , it does feature " the two strongest soul @-@ flecked tracks of Williams ' career " , in " You Know Me " and " Won 't Do That " , and that the singer " simply sounds fantastic with a horn section " . Ben Hogwood from MusicOMH gave the album a mixed review , awarding it with three stars ( out of five ) . He said that the " new songs reflect [ a ] safer maturity " . Hogwood said that the album is " more like a big band version of George Michael 's ' Older ' than a funked @-@ up ' Faith ' " and that , although it has " a killer tune or two " , the album is not exhibit the " same vitality of years ago . " Talking about the production , he felt that " the orchestrations are layered on thickly in an attempt to bring some brightness to the grey . " Hogwood concluded that Williams ' " new found maturity suits his voice on one hand , but given his musical past it makes him a far safer proposition than he used to be . " 
 Los Angeles Times music critic Ann Powers gave the album three stars ( out of four ) stating that the album is " <unk> diverse " . She said that the album is " a full @-@ body flex matching buttery ballads with laser @-@ flecked dance tracks and arch updates from the music hall ; " . Powers felt that the songs " showcase the nasally soulful Williams as an irresistibly smart , cosmopolitan <unk> of the overly wired world . " Regarding the lyrics , Powers said that Williams " focuses hard on the out @-@ of @-@ body experience of the everyday . " She said that the production on the album is " gorgeous " and that " Williams benefits greatly from the gifts of the producer 's longtime team , including the arranger Anne Dudley . " Mikael Wood from Spin gave the album a 7 / 10 rating . He said that the album includes " cowbell @-@ enhanced rave @-@ up , a bit of Lady Gaga – ish electro @-@ pop , and one track named after Transformers " and went on to call the record " a charm offensive with stars and stripes " . 
 Slant Magazine music critic Jonathan Keefe gave the album a mixed review , rating it with two and a half stars ( out of five ) and talked about Williams ' lack of success in the United States , calling him " one of the U.S. pop market 's biggest missed opportunities " . Keefe felt that the album featured the sort of " heavy balladry and slick adult @-@ pop " that made Williams ' earlier records unappealing to American audiences and suggested that by " downplaying [ his ] formerly irrepressible charm " , Reality Killed the Video Star doesn 't do enough to reintroduce the singer to the US pop market . Andy Gill of The Independent gave the album three stars out of five , commenting that " Williams ' albums have increasingly come to focus upon the singer himself , which has consequently made them less and less appealing to those not entirely smitten with his charms . " This sentiment was echoed by Rosie Swash from The Observer who also gave the album three stars out of five . She said that " Reality Killed the Video Star is littered with references to his fall from grace , most of which hinge on the premise that someone or something else is truly responsible for his diminishing popularity . " Swash said that " If there 's a theme here it 's not obvious , but it turns out Williams can be quite interesting when he moves off the topic of himself . " Swash concluded that the album swings between " mawkish strings and piano overproduction " and " flashes of genuine pop frivolity " .

 = Jon Coghill = 
 Jon Coghill ( born 26 August 1971 ) is an Australian drummer best known for his work with Australian rock band , Powderfinger , although he has also toured with Regurgitator . Coghill replaced Powderfinger 's original drummer Steven Bishop in 1991 when Bishop wanted to pursue further studies . At this time , Powderfinger had not made any recordings , and as such , Coghill has been the group 's drummer for all of their releases . 
 = = Biography = = 
 Coghill attended Nambour State High School in Nambour , Queensland where his father was a Physics teacher , graduating in 1988 . While in high school , Coghill 's ambitions were not directed towards music , as he expressed an interest in football or surfing . Upon graduating , he moved to Queensland 's state capital Brisbane and began studying Botany at the University of Queensland , however was interested in the Brisbane local music scene . Before long , Coghill had begun playing drums for local bands including side project Shock Fungus . 
 Coghill met Powderfinger when he attended one of their practice sessions and joked with the band , introducing himself as a drummer . Two years later , when Steven Bishop left the band , guitarist Ian Haug recognised Coghill at an audition , and signed him at that point . Previously , Coghill had been rejected in an audition for Custard . Jon spent about six months playing alongside Scott Coleman and Marc Zande in the Brisbane grunge band , Gland , before committing full @-@ time to Powderfinger in early 1992 . In December 1997 , Coghill took a brief break from Powderfinger and toured with Regurgitator . Drummer Ross McLennan of Far Out Corporation and later from The Predators , took Coghill 's place for a Powderfinger performance on 19 December . 
 Through his time in the band , Coghill has endeavoured to improve his drumming . In 1999 following the release of the band 's third album Internationalist , he took up lessons with Brisbane @-@ based drum tutor Col Gillies . Coghill has stated that he took the lessons due to being " really sore " " three quarters the way through a show " . 
 In 2004 , Coghill was named Best Drummer by Jack Daniels for their inaugural Jack Awards . To commemorate this , he joined with several other Australian musicians to form the one @-@ shot band <unk> <unk> . Composed of members of The <unk> , Silverchair and Sleepy Jackson , along with Coghill from Powderfinger , the group 's name is a portmanteau of all of the members ' band 's names . 
 Coghill has been described by Powderfinger lead singer Bernard Fanning as " psycho " , stating " There 's a constant battle between <unk> and I as to who 's the biggest psycho in the band " on numerous occasions . Fanning has also said of Coghill " He likes to antagonise people , and I don 't mean that in a mean way " , and continued to say jokingly that " It makes me want to smash him sometimes . " Guitarist Darren Middleton says of Coghill " Jon likes movies with explosions in them " , and has also described him as stubborn . Fellow guitarist Ian Haug says Coghill is an excellent arranger , explaining " he can listen to it all , just sort of sit back and go , ' Okay , that 's a really good bit . ' " Coghill himself has described himself as a " superhero " . He has also stated that he shares the band 's hatred of band photos . Coghill says he shares the stereotype of drummers being the most " out there " member of the band . He says this is true because " We have so much energy ... We ’ re stuck up the back and we ’ re more likely to do stupid shit to get rid of it . " In 2008 , Coghill studied a mixture of politics and law at Griffith University . He is currently a journalist for the Australian Broadcasting Corporation . 
 = = Style , technique , and influences = = 
 Coghill took up drumming in high school , because " one of the coolest guy [ s ] " also played the drums . He says he never enjoyed reading about drumming , but preferred to talk to drummers . He has also stated that he doesn 't listen to " drummer music " , but prefers listening to music as a whole . 
 Coghill cites drummers Keith Moon and Mitch Mitchell as major influences on his playing , while boxer Mohammad Ali as a non @-@ musical inspiration . He notes that multi @-@ instrumentalist Stevie Wonder is his favourite . During his university years , Coghill began listening to technical drummers such as Dennis Chambers . Others have noted that Coghill is influenced by The Dead Kennedys and The Fugees . In 1997 , Coghill stated " I ’ m really interested in groove " , and explained that he enjoyed the lyrical elements of Hip Hop and bands such as Spearhead . Coghill has also stated that as a child growing up in Nambour , he had aspired to be " a star like Michael Jackson " . He says this ambition was sparked by a breakdancing teacher in his home town , and by his sister 's love of Jackson 's Thriller . 
 = = Equipment = = 
 Coghill received his first drum at the age of 14 , which was a Pearl drum kit given to him by his parents . In 1999 , Coghill noted that he began using a 1970 Slingerland drum kit , citing that it had a better sound than a new kit , and was cheaper . Coghill uses <unk> Zildjian cymbals . He says that he has been offered sponsorship , but opted for older drums as a matter of preference . Despite this assertion , as of 2007 Coghill 's name is mentioned in the Brady Drums artist roster .

 = Archie Jackson = 
 Archibald " Archie " Jackson ( 5 September 1909 – 16 February 1933 ) , occasionally known as Archibald Alexander Jackson , was an Australian cricketer who played eight Test matches as a specialist batsman between 1929 and 1931 . A teenage prodigy , he played first grade cricket at only 15 years of age and was selected for New South Wales at 17 . In 1929 , aged 19 , Jackson made his Test debut against England , scoring 164 runs in the first innings to become the youngest player to score a Test century . 
 Renowned for his elegant batting style , he played in a manner similar to the great Australian batsmen Victor Trumper , and Alan Kippax , Jackson 's friend and mentor . His Test and first @-@ class career coincided with the early playing years of Don Bradman , with whom he was often compared . Before the two departed for England as part of the 1930 Australian team , some observers considered Jackson the better batsman , capable of opening the batting or coming in down the order . Jackson 's career was dogged by poor health ; illness and his unfamiliarity with local conditions hampered his tour of England , only playing two of the five Test matches . Later in the year , in the series against the West Indies , Jackson was successful in the first Test in Adelaide , scoring 70 not out before a poor run of form led to his omission from the fifth Test . 
 Early in the 1931 – 32 season , Jackson coughed blood and collapsed before the start of play in a Sheffield Shield match against Queensland . Subsequently admitted to a sanatorium in the Blue Mountains , west of Sydney , Jackson was diagnosed with tuberculosis . In an attempt to improve his health and to be closer to his girlfriend , Jackson moved to Brisbane . Ignoring medical advice , Jackson returned to cricket with a local team ; however , his health continued to deteriorate and he died at the age of just 23 . It is speculated that , had he lived , he may have rivalled Don Bradman as a batsman . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 = = = Childhood = = = 
 Jackson , the first son and third child of Alexander and Margaret Jackson , was born in 1909 at Rutherglen , a small town near Glasgow in Scotland . His father had spent part of his childhood in Australia and returned with his family to settle in Balmain , a suburb of Sydney , in 1913 . 
 Raised as a Methodist , Jackson was a lifelong teetotaller and non @-@ smoker . He attended Birchgrove Public and Rozelle Junior Technical schools and represented New South Wales Schoolboys at football and cricket . Football talent ran in the family : his uncle Jimmy Jackson and cousin James Jackson , Jr. were both professional footballers in Scotland and England , the latter captaining Liverpool . 
 Growing up near the home ground of Balmain District Cricket Club , Jackson joined the club in his mid @-@ teens where he quickly came to the attention of the captain , Test bowler Arthur Mailey . The Labor politician " Doc " Evatt , a noted benefactor of young cricketers , helped Jackson 's career by purchasing suitable cricket equipment for him . At the age of 15 years and one month , he made his first grade début for Balmain ; cricket historian David Frith believes that Jackson is the youngest cricketer to play at this level . 
 Jackson left school at this time and worked for a warehouse firm called Jackson & McDonald ( unrelated ) until the demands of cricket compelled him to resign . The Test batsman Alan Kippax employed Jackson in his sporting goods store and became his mentor . In 1925 – 26 , his second season with Balmain , Jackson led the grade cricket competition 's batting averages and won selection for the New South Wales Second XI to play Victoria . 
 = = = Selection for New South Wales = = = 
 Jackson began the 1926 – 27 season with scores of 111 against St George , 198 against Western Suburbs and 106 against Mosman . As a result , he made his first @-@ class début for New South Wales ( NSW ) against Queensland at Brisbane and scored 86 in the second innings . He posted a century in the return match against the Queenslanders at the SCG . On NSW 's tour of the southern states , Jackson made a century in a non first @-@ class fixture against Northern Tasmania and then hit 104 not out against South Australia . These performances prompted the former Australian captain Clem Hill to describe Jackson as " ... the biggest find since Ponsford . " 
 No Test matches were scheduled for 1927 – 28 , although the New Zealand team briefly toured Australia on their return journey from playing in England . Jackson scored 104 against the visiting side and shared a century partnership with Kippax , scored in just over 30 minutes . After a brief run of low scores , a boil on Jackson 's knee forced his withdrawal from the match against South Australia at Adelaide . His replacement was another rising teenage batsman , Donald Bradman , who made his first @-@ class début in the match . On his return to the team , Jackson was promoted to open the batting and scored a century in both innings in the return match against South Australia . At the end of the season , he toured New Zealand with an Australian second XI , while Bradman missed out . The side consisted of a few established Test players mixed with promising youngsters . Australia were unbeaten on the tour and Jackson scored 198 runs in four matches at an average of 49 @.@ 50 .

 = = = Test selection = = = 
 During the 1928 – 29 season , a strong England team captained by Percy Chapman toured Australia for a five @-@ Test Ashes series . Seeking selection in the Australian Test side , Jackson failed twice in a match designated as a Test trial in Melbourne . In the next match , against the English for New South Wales , he scored 4 and 40 while his team @-@ mates Bradman and Kippax both made centuries . Both Bradman and Kippax were selected for the First Test at the Brisbane Exhibition Ground , Jackson missed out . Keeping his name in front of the selectors , he scored 162 and 90 against South Australia . After Australia lost the first three Tests and the Ashes , the selectors gave Jackson his opportunity , selecting him for his Test début in the fourth Test at the Adelaide Oval . Arthur Mailey , his club captain and the only other Test player from Balmain CC to that time , ran from his office at the Sydney Sun to Kippax 's sports store in Martin Place to tell Jackson the good news . 
 England batted first and made 334 . In reply , Jackson opened the batting with Bill Woodfull . Before the Test , the Australian skipper , Jack Ryder , approached Kippax for his opinion about such a young player as Jackson being given the responsibility of opening the batting . Kippax replied , " I am sure he expects to open . " After Australia lost three wickets for 19 runs , Ryder joined Jackson at the wicket . Playing in an unhurried manner , Jackson looked confident against the pace of Harold Larwood and punished Maurice Tate when his bowling strayed down the leg side . In 105 minutes , Jackson and Ryder added 100 runs . Jackson reached his half century , followed by Ryder and at stumps on the second day , Australia 's total was 3 / 131 . 
 The exertion had left Jackson exhausted . His team @-@ mate " Stork " Hendry said that Jackson was limp when he returned to the dressing room . " We had to mop him with cold towels " , he said . Early the next day , Ryder was dismissed and Jackson was joined by Bradman . The two young batsmen shared a long partnership , with Jackson on 97 at the end of the session . As they returned to the wicket after the interval , Bradman advised his younger colleague to play carefully to secure his century . Jackson made no reply , but responded by hitting the first ball from Larwood to the point boundary for four runs , the ball rebounding back on to the field in front of a cheering crowd in the Members ' Stand . After this , he cut loose , with deft glances from the faster balls and cut shots reminiscent of Charlie Macartney . Jackson was eventually dismissed for 164 , making him the youngest Australian batsman to score a Test century , a record beaten by Neil Harvey in 1948 . It is still the second highest score on Test début by an Australian , only one run fewer than Charles Bannerman 's 165 not out in the first @-@ ever Test in 1877 . This innings saw Jackson hailed as a national hero and he was showered with tributes including a public meeting called in his honour by the Mayor of Balmain . 
 In 1929 – 30 , ill @-@ health restricted Jackson to just five first @-@ class matches and five innings for Balmain . Despite his health , Jackson had a successful season , and scored 168 not out against Arthur Gilligan 's English team , which toured Australia briefly en route to New Zealand . He was seen as an automatic selection for the 1930 Ashes tour of England . He confirmed his selection with 182 in a Test trial , an innings regarded by many as the best he had ever played . Another scare with illness saw him hospitalised in Adelaide after the Christmas match against South Australia , missing the next two state matches . His health problems continued after an operation to remove his tonsils ; a procedure that was arranged by the Australian Board of Control despite Jackson never having previously suffered any problems with his tonsils . Bill Ponsford had suffered from tonsillitis during the previous tour and the Board were anxious to avoid similar occurrences . Complications resulting from the operation saw Jackson lose a stone ( 6 @.@ 4 kilograms ) in weight . 
 = = = Ashes tour of England = = = 
 Jackson was included in the Australian squad to tour England in 1930 . The bonus for Australia from England 's 1928 – 29 visit was the emergence of Jackson and Don Bradman and now much was expected of them in a rebuilt Australian squad that retained only four players from the 1926 tour of England . But Jackson was frequently ill and his unfamiliarity with English pitches resulted in patchy form . Even so , he was described at the time by former England player Cecil Parkin as , " a better bat than Bradman " . He was left out of the team for the First Test at Trent Bridge , the only defeat suffered by the Australians all tour . After the Second Test at Lord 's , Jackson recovered some form . Ponsford and Fairfax both fell ill and as a result Jackson was included in the team for the Third Test at Leeds . He scored one run in his only innings while Bradman made a then @-@ record Test score of 334 . Jackson was omitted for the Fourth Test , but a century against Somerset helped him to force his way back into the side for the Fifth and deciding Test at The Oval . 
 In this match Jackson , batting down the order , played a brave innings on a dangerous wicket facing hostile bowling from Larwood . He took repeated blows on the body while scoring a valuable 73 runs . He shared a stand of 243 with Bradman , who scored 232 , and Australia won the Test by an innings and 39 runs to regain The Ashes . Overall , Jackson 's tour was modest , scoring 1 @,@ 097 runs at an average of 34 @.@ 28 with only one hundred , made against Somerset . Wisden Cricketers ' Almanack , in its report on the 1930 Australians , described Jackson as the " ... great disappointment of the team ... with [ his ] well @-@ deserved reputation for grace of style ... at no time did people in England see the real Jackson . " 
 On return to Australia for the 1930 – 31 season , Jackson was selected for the first four Tests against the West Indies . After scoring 70 not out in the First Test in Adelaide , his form tapered away and managed only 124 runs at an average of 31 @.@ 00 for the first four Tests , resulting in his omission for the Fifth and final Test in Sydney . In Jackson 's absence , the West Indies defeated Australia for the first time in a Test . The West Indies captain Jackie Grant , in a daring move , declared his team 's innings closed twice in order to catch the home team on a " sticky wicket " . Jackson , in his capacity as twelfth man , came in as a runner for an injured batsman on the final afternoon , making what was to be his final appearance in first @-@ class cricket . 
 It was during this Australian season , during a match in Brisbane , that Jackson was introduced to Phyllis Thomas , a trained ballet dancer , who later became his fiancée . In March 1931 , Jackson felt his health had recovered sufficiently to join an exhibition tour of Far North Queensland , led by Alan Kippax . He found the tour exhausting , with arduous travel and damp weather , but played well enough to top the aggregate with over 1 @,@ 100 runs at an average of 93 @.@ 00 . In a letter to his childhood friend and New South Wales team @-@ mate , Bill Hunt , he wrote , " Our tour of North Queensland has now concluded and thank goodness ! ... I would never make this trip again unless I was guaranteed ₤ 100 , and that 's not enough ! " 
 = = Illness and death = = 
 Jackson began the 1931 – 32 season in form and seemingly in good health , scoring 183 for Balmain in grade cricket against Gordon . He was selected for the NSW team to play Queensland in Brisbane . Before the match commenced , Jackson collapsed after coughing up blood and was rushed to hospital . Jackson believed he was suffering from influenza and he was discharged after five days , when he returned to Sydney . Within a week of his return , the Board of Control arranged for Jackson to be admitted to a sanatorium at Wentworth Falls in the Blue Mountains . After a few months at the sanatorium , Jackson moved into a cottage at nearby Leura to be cared for by his sister . 
 = = = Tuberculosis = = = 
 Seeking treatment for psoriasis , Jackson travelled to Adelaide in July 1932 . During his time there , he felt well enough to have an occasional training session in the nets . At the same time , a confidential report was sent to the New South Wales Cricket Association confirming that Jackson had , " ... <unk> tuberculosis with fairly extensive involvement of the lungs . " He returned to Leura and made plans to move to Brisbane , in the belief that the warmer climate would aid his recovery and to be closer to Phyllis . 
 In Brisbane , Jackson offered his services to grade club Northern Suburbs , against the advice of his doctors . Despite suffering from a chronic shortness of breath , he averaged 159 @.@ 66 over seven innings and drew record crowds to the club 's matches . The media and public were keen to see him selected for the early tour matches against the touring English team ; however , medical advice prevented his inclusion . Jackson took work as a sales assistant at a sports depot and wrote a column for the Brisbane Mail . He wrote extensively on the Bodyline tactics employed by the English team during the summer . Jackson insisted that Bodyline was legitimate , held no threat to the game , and that it could be combatted — a minority view in Australia at that time . 
 = = = Death = = = 
 In early February 1933 , Jackson collapsed after playing cricket and was admitted to hospital . Aware of the serious nature of his illness and the possibility of his death , Jackson and Phyllis announced their engagement . As the Brisbane Test between Australia and England began , Jackson suffered a severe pulmonary hemorrhage . His parents made their way to Brisbane to see him and many members of the English and Australian teams visited him in hospital during his last days . On 16 February 1933 , Jackson became the youngest Test cricketer to die until <unk> Rana in 2007 . 
 Jackson 's body was transported back to Sydney by train , which also carried the Australia and England teams for the next Test . Thousands of mourners lined the streets of Sydney for his funeral and the pallbearers were Woodfull , Ponsford , McCabe , Bert Oldfield , Vic Richardson and Bradman . He was buried at the Field of Mars cemetery and a public subscription was raised to install a headstone on his gravesite . The headstone , reading simply He played the game , was unveiled by the Premier of New South Wales Bertram Stevens . 
 = = Style = = 
 Jackson was seen as a stylish and elegant batsman , with a genius for timing and placement . His footwork was light and his supple wrists allowed him to steer the ball square and late . He held the bat high on the handle and his cover drive was executed with balletic grace . He was seen as possessing the comely movement and keenness of eye of the great batsman of cricket 's Golden Age , Victor Trumper . Bradman described Jackson as " tall and slim , rather lethargic and graceful in his movements " . Jackson professed a love of applying the maximum velocity to the ball with a minimum of effort . His one identifiable fault was an occasional failing outside off @-@ stump , being prone to unnecessarily dab at away @-@ swingers and being caught in the slips cordon . 
 His contemporaries noted his classical style . The journalist <unk> Palmer described his cover drive as " ... perfectly balanced and true ... the bat seems a whip in his hands . " Clem Hill , the former Australian captain , noted Jackson 's sparkling footwork , watching close enough to notice that his toes turned in as he walked . Like Kippax , whose style was uncannily similar , Jackson wore his shirt @-@ sleeves almost down to his wrists . This was not in imitation but to conceal the blemishes on his arms caused by psoriasis . Kippax was not seen by some as the best person to imitate , with Charles Kelleway critical of Jackson 's flourishes , wishing he would not be so , " ... cramped in copying other batsman 's styles " . 
 Inevitably , he was compared to his New South Wales and Australian team @-@ mate , Bradman . In contrast to Jackson , Bradman made not even a pretence of being a stylist . A writer , comparing the two after Jackson 's Test début , stated that Bradman had " forced his way to the top by sheer natural ability , a straight bat , cool cheerful temperament , determination and enterprise " , but Jackson was " the finished batsman , the batsman who knows one stroke for each ball ... [ and ] executes that stroke with an artistry that has no parallel to this day " . Before the 1930 tour of England , experts such as Frank Woolley , Percy Fender and Maurice Tate rated Jackson as more likely to succeed in English conditions ; Bradman was seen as too unorthodox or even cross @-@ batted for softer English wickets . 
 = USS Texas ( 1892 ) = 
 USS Texas was a second @-@ class battleship built by the United States in the early 1890s , the first American battleship commissioned and the first ship named in honor of the state of Texas to be built by the United States . Built in reaction to the acquisition of modern armored warships by several South American countries , Texas was meant to incorporate the latest developments in naval tactics and design . This includes the mounting of her main armament en echelon to allow maximum end – on fire and a heavily – armored redoubt amidships to ensure defensive strength . However , due to the state of U.S. industry at the time , Texas 's building time was lengthy and by the time she was commissioned , she was already out – of – date . Nevertheless , she and her near – sister USS Maine were considered advancements in American naval design . 
 Texas developed a reputation as a jinxed or unlucky ship after several accidents early in her career ; she consequently earned the nickname " Old Hoodoo " . These mishaps included problems during construction , a grounding off Newport , Rhode Island , and flooding shortly afterwards while at dock in New York City . In the last , she settled to the bottom with her gun deck awash and several crew members drowned . She also received significant damage to her hull in drydock after being raised . Her reputation improved with her service in the Spanish – American War , when she blockaded the coast of Cuba and fought in the Battle of Santiago de Cuba . 
 After the war , Texas returned to peacetime duty , interrupted by several refits . She became the station ship in Charleston , South Carolina by 1908 and was renamed San Marcos in 1911 to allow her name to be used by a new battleship . She became a target ship that same year and was sunk in shallow water in Chesapeake Bay . She was used as a gunnery target through World War II and was finally demolished in 1959 because her remains were considered a navigational hazard .

 The delivery of the Brazilian battleship Riachuelo in 1883 and the acquisition of other armored warships by Brazil , Argentina , and Chile shortly afterward alarmed the United States government , as the Brazilian Navy was now the most powerful in the Western Hemisphere . The United States Navy now felt capable only of defending its own ports . The Chairman of the House Naval Affairs Committee , Congressman Hilary A. Herbert characterized the situation thusly : " if all this old navy of ours were drawn up in battle array in mid @-@ ocean and confronted by the Riachuelo it is doubtful whether a single vessel bearing the American flag would get into port . " 
 The Navy Advisory Board , confronted with the possibility of hostile ironclads operating off the American coast , began planning for a pair of ships to protect that coast in 1884 . Both had to fit within existing docks and had to have a shallow draft to enable them to use all the major American ports and bases . They had to have a minimum speed of 17 knots ( 31 km / h ; 20 mph ) and were to displace about 6 @,@ 000 long tons ( 6 @,@ 100 t ) . They were both optimized for end @-@ on fire and had their gun turrets sponsoned out over the sides of the ship and echeloned to allow them to fire across the deck , much like the battleships Riachuelo and <unk> . The first ship , laid down for the then – traditional cruiser mission of battleship substitute on overseas deployment and armed with four 10 in ( 250 mm ) guns , became Maine . The other , armed with two 12 in ( 300 mm ) guns , became Texas . 
 The Navy Department conducted an international design competition for Texas and the winner was the Naval Construction & Armament Co. of Barrow @-@ in @-@ Furness , England . The winning design placed Texas 's forward turret on the port side and her aft turret to starboard . The need for cross @-@ deck fire caused the superstructure to be separated into three pieces to allow for each gun to fire between the sections of the superstructure . This significantly limited the gun 's ability to fire to the opposite beam as the superstructure still restricted each gun 's arc of fire . Furthermore , neither the deck nor the superstructure was reinforced to withstand the muzzle blast as the gun fired , as demonstrated during the Battle of Santiago de Cuba when her starboard deck was damaged . 
 Even five years before Texas was complete , the blast effects from end @-@ on fire were considered prohibitive and en echelon mounting of main guns was abandoned in European navies . This made Texas 's armament arrangement obsolete . The then @-@ new Board on Construction considered a thorough re @-@ design which would have placed Texas 's main guns on the centerline , either in two single turrets or one twin turret , and the heavy redoubt eliminated . Construction by this time was too far advanced for such a plan , however , and Navy Secretary Benjamin Tracy limited the Board to detail improvements . 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 Texas was 308 feet 10 inches ( 94 @.@ 1 m ) long overall . She had a beam of 64 feet 1 inch ( 19 @.@ 5 m ) and a maximum draft of 24 feet 6 inches ( 7 @.@ 5 m ) . She displaced 6 @,@ 315 long tons ( 6 @,@ 416 t ) at full load as built . Her hull had two wing compartments on each side of her machinery spaces as well as a centerline longitudinal watertight bulkhead separating the engines and boilers . Asymmetric flooding of the wing compartments posed a grave danger to her stability . Her double bottom protected most of her hull and extended up the side to the lower edge of the armor deck . She had a metacentric height of 2 @.@ 54 feet ( 0 @.@ 8 m ) and was fitted with a ram bow .

 Texas 's machinery was built by the Richmond Locomotive and Machine Works of Richmond , Virginia . She had two inverted vertical triple expansion steam engines with a total designed output of 8 @,@ 610 indicated horsepower ( 6 @,@ 420 kW ) . Each engine drove one propeller shaft . Four double @-@ ended Scotch marine boilers provided steam to the engines at a working pressure of 175 psi ( 1 @,@ 210 kPa ; 12 @.@ 3 kgf / cm2 ) . On trials , she reached a speed of 17 @.@ 8 knots ( 33 @.@ 0 km / h ; 20 @.@ 5 mph ) , exceeding her contract speed of 17 knots ( 31 km / h ; 20 mph ) . She carried a maximum load of 877 short tons ( 796 t ) of coal . She carried two Edison electric dynamos to power her searchlights and provide interior lighting .

 Texas 's main armament consisted of two 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) / 35 caliber Mark I guns mounted in single Mark 2 hydraulically powered turrets inside her armored redoubt . These guns had a maximum elevation of 15 ° and could depress to − 5 ° . Eighty rounds per gun were carried . They fired a 870 @-@ pound ( 394 @.@ 6 kg ) shell at a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 100 ft / s ( 640 m / s ) to a range of about 12 @,@ 000 yards ( 11 @,@ 000 m ) at maximum elevation . The fixed rammers were below and outside the turrets . Initially , they could only be loaded at one positions , dead @-@ ahead and at 0 ° elevation , but they were modified to load at all angles of train just before the start of the Spanish – American War . 
 Four of the six 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) guns were mounted in casemates in the hull and the other two were mounted on the main deck in open pivot positions . The two main deck guns were 35 @-@ caliber weapons , while the casemate guns were 30 @-@ caliber guns . Data are lacking , but they could probably depress to − 7 ° and elevate to + 12 ° . They fired shells that weighed 105 pounds ( 47 @.@ 6 kg ) with a muzzle velocity of about 1 @,@ 950 ft / s ( 590 m / s ) . They had a maximum range less than 9 @,@ 000 yd ( 8 @,@ 200 m ) when fired at maximum elevation . 
 The <unk> boat armament consisted of 12 57 mm ( 2 @.@ 2 in ) six @-@ pounder guns ( of unknown type ) in casemates spaced along the hull . They fired a shell weighing about 6 lb ( 2 @.@ 7 kg ) at a muzzle velocity of about 1 @,@ 765 ft / s ( 538 m / s ) at a rate of 20 rounds per minute . Their range was less than 8 @,@ 700 yd ( 8 @,@ 000 m ) . Two 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Hotchkiss five @-@ barrel revolving guns each were mounted on the fore and aft superstructures . In addition , two 37 @-@ mm Driggs @-@ Schroeder one @-@ pounder guns were mounted in each fighting top . They fired a shell weighing about 1 @.@ 1 lb ( 0 @.@ 50 kg ) at a muzzle velocity of about 2 @,@ 000 ft / s ( 610 m / s ) to a range about 3 @,@ 500 yd ( 3 @,@ 200 m ) . They had a rate of fire of about 30 rounds per minute . 
 Texas carried four 14 @-@ inch ( 356 mm ) torpedo tubes , all above water . One tube each was in the bow and stern and another on each side , towards the rear of the hull . She was originally intended to carry two small steam torpedo boats , each with a one @-@ pounder gun , and a trainable torpedo tube , but they were cancelled after the poor performance of the boat built for the Maine .

 The main waterline belt , made of Harvey armor , had a maximum thickness of 12 inches and tapered to 6 inches ( 152 mm ) at its lower edge . It was 188 feet ( 57 @.@ 3 m ) long and covered the machinery spaces . It was 7 feet ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) high , of which 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 9 m ) was above the design waterline . It angled inwards for 17 feet ( 5 @.@ 2 m ) at each end , thinning to 8 inches ( 203 mm ) , to provide protection against raking fire . It sloped downwards to meet the top of the protective deck . It was 2 inches ( 51 mm ) thick and sloped downwards at the ends of the ship . It also sloped downwards to the sides , but its thickness increased to 3 inches ( 76 mm ) . A 12 @-@ inch thick diagonal armored citadel on the gun deck protected the turret machinery and the supports of the conning tower . The deck above it was two inches thick .
