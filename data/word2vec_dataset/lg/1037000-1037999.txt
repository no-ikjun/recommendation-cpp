 Various version of " Between You and Me " have appeared on several DC Talk official releases , including the band 's greatest hits album Intermission . Interestingly , a live version of " Between You and Me " is not included on the 1997 live release Welcome to the Freak Show . This is due to the fact that " Between You and Me " was not played until the last dates of the tour , after which the recording had already taken place . The music video , however , was included on the DVD release of the album . " Between You and Me " also appears on the compilation album WOW 1997 . The song was also covered by both Relient K and the team @-@ up of Paul Wright and <unk> Woods for the tribute album Freaked !

 = The Boat Race 2014 = 
 The 160th Boat Race took place on 6 April 2014 . Following a clash of oars which broke one of the Cambridge 's crew 's riggers , Oxford won the race by 11 lengths , the largest margin of victory since 1973 . 
 In the reserve race Oxford 's Isis beat Cambridge 's Goldie , while Oxford won the Women 's Boat Race .

 The Boat Race is an annual rowing eight competition between the University of Oxford and the University of Cambridge . First held in 1829 , the competition is a 4 @.@ 2 @-@ mile ( 6 @.@ 8 km ) race along The Championship Course on the River Thames in southwest London . The rivalry is a major point of honour between the two universities and followed throughout the United Kingdom and worldwide . Oxford went into the race as reigning champions , having beaten Cambridge by one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half lengths in the previous year 's race . However Cambridge held the overall lead , with 81 victories to Oxford 's 77 . 
 The first Women 's Boat Race took place in 1927 , but did not become an annual fixture until the 1960s . Until 2014 , the contest was conducted as part of the Henley Boat Races , but as of the 2015 race , it is held on the River Thames , on the same day as the men 's main and reserve races . The reserve race , contested between Oxford 's Isis boat and Cambridge 's Goldie boat has been held since 1965 . It usually takes place on the Tideway , prior to the main Boat Race . 
 = = Crews = = 
 The Cambridge crew ( known as the " Light Blues " ) had a 5 @-@ kilogram ( 11 lb ) per person advantage , but Oxford ( the " Dark Blues " ) were the pre @-@ race favourites . The Cambridge crew was 24 years old on average , while Oxford averaged 26 years . The Oxford crew featured three British rowers , two Canadians , two New Zealanders , an American , and one member with dual Canadian @-@ American citizenship . The Cambridge crew consisted of three British rowers , four Americans , an Australian , and a German . Three of the Oxford rowers had competed in the Olympics .

 At race time , conditions were mild with an overcast sky . A crowd of 250 @,@ 000 people were in attendance . It was sponsored by BNY Mellon and thus officially titled " The BNY Mellon Boat Race " . Oxford won the coin toss and elected to start from the southern bank of the Thames . In the first five minutes of the race , the lead changed hands three times . First Oxford , then Cambridge drifted towards the centre of the river and were warned by the umpire . Oxford turned away , but before Cambridge had time to do so , the two boats bumped . The clash caused a rowing error by Cambridge 's Luke Juckett , as he was bucked from his seat and nearly thrown overboard . He did not recover until five strokes later . Oxford took advantage , rowing out to a significant lead with two @-@ thirds of the course to go , and steadily increased the gap . Cambridge were unable to respond and in the end Oxford won by 11 lengths , the largest margin of victory since 1973 . 
 Oxford finished with a time of 18 minutes , 36 seconds ; this was 32 seconds faster than Cambridge . It was their fifth victory in the last seven years , and tenth in the last fifteen . Stroke Constantine Louloudis was a member of a victorious Oxford crew for the third time ( 2011 , 2013 and 2014 – he competed in the Olympics instead in 2012 ) . Cambridge now lead the overall series 81 – 78 . At the finish , the Oxford crew threw their cox , Laurence Harvey , into the water in celebration . After the race , Cambridge appealed the result but umpire Richard Phelps ruled that the bump occurred on neutral water and that neither crew should be penalised . Oxford 's Sam O ’ Connor called it " very minor , one of the smallest clashes I ’ ve ever had " . Juckett said the clash broke his rigger and made it " really hard to keep rowing " , but added that " clashing is part of the race . " 
 In the reserve race , Oxford 's Isis beat Cambridge 's Goldie . Earlier , Oxford also won the women 's race . 
 = = Reaction = = 
 O 'Connor said he was confident Oxford would have won even without the clash . Oxford Boat Club president Malcolm Howard remarked " You cannot help but feel for the two @-@ seat of Cambridge , it ’ s tough . " Cambridge Boat Club president Steve Dudek called it " a frustrating way to lose ... I would never wish that on anyone . " BBC commentator Tom James remarked it was " great for British rowing " that Louloudis won the race for the third time . 
 An estimated 130 million people worldwide watched the event on television . 
 = New York State Route 454 = 
 New York State Route 454 ( NY 454 ) , also known as the Suffolk County Veterans Memorial Highway or simply Vets Highway , is a 13 @.@ 67 @-@ mile ( 22 @.@ 00 km ) east – west divided highway in western and central Suffolk County on Long Island in New York . It spans from NY 25 ( Jericho Turnpike ) in Commack to NY 27 ( Sunrise Highway ) in Holbrook . The route provides access to the Long Island MacArthur Airport , as well as New York State and Suffolk County government offices , and at one time the Long Island Arena . NY 454 serves as the northern terminus for the Northern State Parkway in Hauppauge , where a concurrency with NY 347 begins . 
 The origins of NY 454 date back to the late 1940s when a new freeway was constructed from Commack to Holbrook for $ 1 @.@ 4 million ( 1949 USD ) . This new freeway was designated as a memorial for Suffolk County War Veterans . The route was designed and constructed by the Suffolk County Department of Public Works under watch and aid from the New York State Department of Public Works and the United States government . Upon completion in January 1950 , the route was designated as County Route 76 ( CR 76 ) west of Town Line Road and CR 78 southeast of Town Line Road until 1968 when the entire highway was designated CR 78 . In 1972 , the state took over control of the new highway and designated it NY 454 . Recently , there have been plans to expand the highway and the concurrency with Route 347 with new travel lanes and a new interchange being built between the two highways . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 454 begins at a fork along NY 25 ( Jericho Turnpike ) in Commack . The route heads southeastward as the four @-@ lane Veterans Memorial Highway , passing through a large commercial district built up around NY 454 's interchange with the Sunken Meadow State Parkway ( exit <unk> ) . From there , NY 454 continues eastward through a residential district for several miles and passes to the south of Whitman Hollow Park . The arterial continues southeastward through local residential areas with four lanes before meeting NY 347 and the Northern State Parkway at an interchange in Hauppauge . The junction serves as the western terminus of NY 347 and the eastern terminus of the Northern Parkway . NY 347 and NY 454 become concurrent , crossing through Hauppauge and residential properties for the next two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) , intersecting with local roads . After bending around <unk> Park , Routes 454 and 347 follow the town line and pass the <unk> Golf Course , where NY 347 forks to the northeast . 
 From there , NY 454 turns to the southeast , intersecting with NY 111 ( Wheeler Road ) and narrowing to two lanes . After turning further to the south , the highway intersects with CR 67 , the former alignment of the Long Island Motor Parkway . Here , NY 454 returns to four lanes and meets the Long Island Expressway ( Interstate 495 ) and its frontage roads . The route enters the village of Islandia and enters a large commercial district , where the route intersects with CR 100 ( Old Nichols Road ) . After crossing the Long Island Rail Road , NY 454 enters <unk> River State Park , bends to the east and traverses the park . Crossing over the <unk> River , the arterial crosses a hiking trail and soon leaves the park . 
 NY 454 continues as a four @-@ lane arterial through a large commercial district , intersecting with CR 93 ( Lakeland Avenue ) . There , the highway passes Long Island MacArthur Airport and bends to the east through another large commercial district remaining unchanged for several miles . The route turns to the southeast at Coates Avenue as a four @-@ lane arterial for the last two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) of NY 454 . About three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) from Lakeland Avenue , NY 454 connects to the Sunrise Highway ( NY 27 ) at exit 51 , a partial interchange in Holbrook . Here , the NY 454 designation ends and its right @-@ of @-@ way merges into the eastbound service road of NY 27 . There is no access to westbound Sunrise Highway from NY 454 itself ; instead , the connection is made by way of nearby Broadway Avenue . 
 = = History = = 
 Construction first began in 1948 for a new freeway from Commack to Holbrook by the Suffolk County Department of Public Works . The $ 1 @.@ 4 million ( 1949 USD ) project was funded by federal aid and was designated as a new memorial for the war veterans . People had been arguing since 1947 to get a new county @-@ funded war veteran memorial installed in Suffolk , including a number of other suggested projects such as trees at a park in Yaphank to a new general @-@ use hospital . On April 30 , 1949 , the sides came to agreement to name the new highway for the war veterans , and two agencies were hired to come up with a name . The design for the freeway between Commack and Holbrook included a 145 @-@ foot @-@ wide ( 44 m ) right @-@ of @-@ way , and the road was constructed under the supervision of the New York State Department of Public Works . 
 Construction continued throughout 1949 , with the new Veterans Memorial Highway opening on January 25 , 1950 . The new 13 @.@ 62 @-@ mile ( 21 @.@ 92 km ) highway was designated as CR 76 for 4 @.@ 18 miles ( 6 @.@ 73 km ) through Smithtown and CR 78 for the remaining 9 @.@ 44 miles ( 15 @.@ 19 km ) in the town of Islip . The new freeway 's wide right @-@ of @-@ way was built with room for additional lanes if the situation became necessary . Although the state of New York and the federal government both helped aid the project , the control of the new highway was turned over to the Suffolk County Superintendent of Highways . In March 1968 , CR 76 was truncated to begin at NY 347 while CR 78 was extended northwestward over CR 76 's former routing to NY 25 in Commack . 
 In 1970 , the Nassau – Suffolk Regional Planning Board brought up plans to convert CR 78 into a six @-@ lane expressway with new service roads . A similar project was planned for the nearby four @-@ lane NY 347 through Islip . To aid this , ownership and maintenance of CR 78 was transferred to the New York State Department of Transportation on March 29 , 1972 , receiving the designation of NY 454 . The state immediately expanded NY 454 to six lanes , with three in each direction from Holbrook to the terminus of NY 347 . In 1977 , the state designated the portion of the highway in <unk> as both NY 454 and NY 347 after it became clear that the Hauppauge Spur of the Long Island Expressway would not be constructed . The plans to expand NY 454 and NY 347 into full @-@ blown freeways were discarded by the 1980s . 
 During the 1990s , the Department of Transportation looked into the expansion of NY 347 and NY 454 . The studies suggested that the state would add one additional traffic lane in each direction , giving most of the highway six lanes with eight travel lanes along the concurrency in Hauppauge . The new lanes would also be capable of holding rapid @-@ commute vehicles for the Long Island Rapid Commute . The interchange where Routes 347 and 454 fork in <unk> is slated to go from an at @-@ grade fork to a grade @-@ separated interchange . The project , which will cost $ 359 million ( 2009 USD ) is scheduled to be completed between 2012 and 2015 .

 Mars filmed the music video for " Treasure " with Taja Riley , a model and dancer , in Las Vegas on May 20 , 2013 , the day after the live performance of the song at the 2013 Billboard Music Awards . It was directed by Cameron Duddy and Mars , who also directed the videos for the last two singles of the album , " Locked Out of Heaven " and " When I Was Your Man " . The video was released on June 14 , 2013 , by Mars on his official Twitter account and was the third of Mars series to feature simple effects from the late 1970s and early 1980s music videos . 
 Mars and The Hooligans perform the song along with a simple synchronized choreography in matching red suits , leopard print shirts and gold chains . The set features a disco ball , vintage stage lights , the set up of the instruments in the background and other elements present in the disco era . The style of the music video greatly resembles the performance held at the 2013 Billboard Music Awards . Following the 1970s theme , the video is unavailable in high definition , and is rather shown in standard @-@ definition quality and with a 4 : 3 aspect ratio . For EW , Kyle Anderson , pointed out " It ’ s all there : The suits , the setting , and the bong @-@ water video effects " , while Melinda Newman for HitFix noticed that " to complete the look , the video features special effects , including crude back lighting , wacky dissolves , geometric shapes , and a Space Wars @-@ like background " .

 Michael Lopez from The Huffington Post reviewed the video saying " <unk> a bright red blazer and a hefty afro , the part @-@ Puerto Rican crooner looks like he time traveled to a vintage Euro discotheque . But to be honest , the trend works ! And it ’ s certainly helped by ' Treasure 's ' bouncy beats " . Kyle Anderson from EW wrote " We should probably just change the name of this year from ' 2013 ' to ' 1978 ' , because there are more sparkly suits and disco guitars than we know what to do with " and that " Bruno Mars has gone full @-@ on Betamax for his new video for the track ' Treasure ' . It 's all there : the suits , the setting , and the bong @-@ water video effects " . Jordan Sargent of Spin said that Mars wasn 't trying to hide the Michael Jackson influence on the video , writing " new low @-@ def makes obvious — compare it next to , say , the video for " Rock With You " " . Similarly , Robbie Daw , from the Idolator website , drew attention to the fact that the song and dance had already been seen during the performance on Billboard Music Awards in May , since " Mars and his band seem to have recreated that very same performance for this clip " . He also wrote that the video was " still a fun three minutes to sit through " , mainly because " Bruno mimics MJ 's " Rock With You " moves so deftly " . According to Joseph Atilano of the Philippine Daily Inquirer , " everything from the choreography , stage lighting , and so on , serve as a heartfelt ode to that era " . He wrote " visually , the music video is tricked out with set pieces such as a disco ball and vintage stage lights . Even the manner by which the instruments were set up in the background show the attention given to even the minutest of details and the small things do matter when it comes to making a music video " . 
 Mars , who choreographed the video , won the award for Best Choreography during the 2013 MTV Video Music Awards . The video for the song was nominated for Outstanding Music Video at the 2014 NAACP Image Award .

 " My Kind of Town " or " My Kind of Town ( Chicago Is ) " is a popular song composed by Jimmy Van Heusen , with lyrics by Sammy Cahn . It was originally part of the musical score for Robin and the 7 Hoods , a 1964 musical film starring several members of the Rat Pack . It was nominated for the 1964 Academy Award for Best Original Song but lost to " Chim Chim Cher @-@ ee " from Mary Poppins . Although the song predated the Grammy Award Best Original Song for a Motion Picture category , the entire score was nominated for the 1964 Grammy Award in the category Best Original Score Written for A Motion Picture , but it lost to the eponymously titled Mary Poppins score . 
 Frank Sinatra recorded several versions which have appeared on many of his albums . Also , many artists have performed the song as a tribute to Sinatra in posthumous tribute albums . In addition , the song had been recorded by many other artists prior to Sinatra 's death . The lyrics , which praise the city of Chicago for its people and institutions , repeat the title phrase several times , usually in a line that says " My kind of town , Chicago is " .

 The original context of the song , in the film Robin and the 7 Hoods , is the mob boss Robbo ( Sinatra ) having just been acquitted of murdering the sheriff , a crime for which he had been framed . He walks out of the courthouse and joyously sings the song in gratitude to the gathered crowd of Chicagoans . The people eventually join in the singing . Instrumental versions of the song make up the opening and closing credits , and a dance band also plays the song in Robbo 's speakeasy . 
 <unk> by Sinatra , " My Kind of Town " was originally recorded on April 8 , 1964 in Los Angeles , California . The official B @-@ side song was " I Like To Lead When I Dance " . The song was recorded as a 45 on Reprise Records . The sheet music was copyrighted and published by Sergeant Music Co . , <unk> Inc. and Van Heusen Music Corp. The music is written in the key of A @-@ flat , in 2 / 2 meter ( known as cut time ) with an allegro tempo . 
 Sinatra recorded " My Kind of Town " twice in a studio setting , and two live versions were officially released , on Sinatra at the Sands ( 1966 ) and The Main Event – Live ( 1974 ) . One of the more famous bootleg recordings is a concert of May 22 , 1968 at the Oakland Coliseum . On the 1966 album Sinatra at the Sands , the song appears both as the 20th and 22nd ( final ) track . However , the final track is merely a one @-@ minute reprise . On the 1994 album Duets II , Sinatra sings with his son , Frank Sinatra , Jr . , as the 13th of 14 tracks with a length of 2 : 36 . 
 Sinatra would occasionally alter the lyrics slightly . In early versions , when the Union Stock Yards ( which closed in 1971 ) still existed , one of the final lines was " The Union Stock Yards , Chicago is ... " . In later versions , this line is replaced with " The Chicago <unk> , Chicago is " . The song also appears on The Ultimate Rat Pack Collection : Live & Swingin ' , a 2003 DVD and CD release of the 1965 " Frank Sinatra Spectacular " benefit concert . However , since the concert takes place in St. Louis , Missouri , the lyrics were altered to reflect St. Louis as the town in Sinatra 's affections . 
 Although some sources say the song was arranged by Nelson Riddle ( who had scored Robin and the 7 Hoods ) , the " Sinatra Reprise : Very Good Years " Album Cover credits Billy May as the arranger .

 Business M @-@ 28 ( Bus . M @-@ 28 ) was a state trunkline highway in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan . It served as a business route running for 9 @.@ 010 miles ( 14 @.@ 500 km ) through the Newberry area .

 Bus . M @-@ 28 was originally a section of M @-@ 28 before the latter was realigned in the late 1930s . The highway carried the M @-@ 28A designation before it was redesignated as Bus . M @-@ 28 in 1950 . The trunkline was partially turned back to local control in 1953 , and the business loop designation was removed at that time .

 M @-@ 28 was transferred to a new roadway south of Newberry in late 1935 or early 1936 as shown on the Michigan State Highway Department ( MSHD ) maps of the time . The segment of roadway between the new highway and downtown Newberry was given the M @-@ 28A designation . In downtown Newberry , M @-@ 28A followed M @-@ 48 south , returning to M @-@ 28 .

 = System Shock = 
 System Shock is a 1994 first @-@ person action role @-@ playing video game developed by Looking Glass Technologies and published by Origin Systems . It was directed by Doug Church with Warren Spector serving as producer . The game is set aboard a space station in a cyberpunk vision of the year <unk> . Assuming the role of a nameless hacker , the player attempts to hinder the plans of a malevolent artificial intelligence called SHODAN . 
 System Shock 's 3D engine , physics simulation and complex gameplay have been cited as both innovative and influential . The developers sought to build on the emergent gameplay and immersive environments of their previous games , Ultima Underworld : The Stygian Abyss and Ultima Underworld II : Labyrinth of Worlds , by streamlining their mechanics into a more " integrated whole " . 
 Critics praised System Shock and hailed it as a major breakthrough in its genre . It was later placed on multiple hall of fame lists . The game was a moderate commercial success , with sales exceeding 170 @,@ 000 copies , but Looking Glass ultimately lost money on the project . A sequel , System Shock 2 , was released by Looking Glass Studios and offshoot developer Irrational Games in 1999 . The 2000 game Deus Ex and the 2007 game BioShock are spiritual successors to the two games . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 System Shock takes place from a first @-@ person perspective in a three @-@ dimensional ( 3D ) graphical environment . The game is set inside a large , multi @-@ level space station , in which players explore , combat enemies and solve puzzles . Progress is largely non @-@ linear and the game is designed to allow for emergent gameplay . As in Ultima Underworld , the player uses a freely movable mouse cursor to aim weapons , to interact with objects and to manipulate the heads @-@ up display ( HUD ) interface . View and posture controls on the HUD allow the player to lean left or right , look up or down , crouch , and crawl . Practical uses for these actions include taking cover , retrieving items from beneath the player character and navigating small passages , respectively . The HUD also features three " Multi @-@ Function Displays " , which may be configured to display information such as weapon readouts , an automap and an inventory . 
 The player advances the plot by acquiring log discs and e @-@ mails : the game contains no non @-@ player characters with which to converse . Throughout the game , an evil artificial intelligence called SHODAN hinders the player 's progress with traps and blocked pathways . Specific computer terminals allow the player to temporarily enter Cyberspace ; inside , the player moves weightlessly through a wire frame 3D environment , while collecting data and fighting SHODAN 's security programs . Actions in Cyberspace sometimes cause events in the game 's physical world ; for example , certain locked doors may only be opened in Cyberspace . Outside of Cyberspace , the player uses the game 's sixteen weapons , of which a maximum of seven may be carried at one time , to combat robots , cyborgs and mutants controlled by SHODAN . Projectile weapons often have selectable ammunition types with varying effects ; for example , the " dart pistol " may fire either explosive needles or tranquilizers . Energy weapons and several types of explosives may also be found , with the latter ranging from percussion grenades to land mines . 
 Along with weapons , the player collects items such as dermal patches and first @-@ aid kits . Dermal patches provide the character with beneficial effects — such as regeneration or increased melee attack power — but can cause detrimental side @-@ effects , such as fatigue and distorted color perception . <unk> " hardware " may also be found , including energy shields and head @-@ mounted lanterns . Increasingly advanced versions of this hardware may be obtained as the game progresses . When activated , most hardware drains from a main energy reserve , which necessitates <unk> . Certain hardware displays the effectiveness of attacks when active , with messages such as " Normal damage " . When an enemy is attacked , the damage is calculated by armor absorption , vulnerabilities , critical hits and a degree of randomness . Weapons and munitions deal specific kinds of damage , and certain enemies are immune , or more vulnerable , to particular types . For example , electromagnetic pulse weapons heavily damage robots , but do not affect mutants . Conversely , gas grenades are effective against mutants , but do not damage robots . 
 = = Plot = = 
 In the game 's prologue , the protagonist — a nameless hacker — is caught while attempting to access files concerning Citadel Station , a space station owned by the fictional TriOptimum Corporation . The hacker is taken to Citadel Station and brought before Edward Diego , a TriOptimum executive . Diego offers to drop all charges against the hacker in exchange for a confidential hacking of SHODAN , the artificial intelligence that controls the station . Diego secretly plans to steal an experimental mutagenic virus being tested on Citadel Station , and to sell it on the black market as a biological weapon . To entice cooperation , Diego promises the hacker a valuable military grade neural implant . After hacking SHODAN , removing the AI 's ethical constraints , and handing control over to Diego , the protagonist undergoes surgery to implant the promised neural interface . Following the operation , the hacker is put into a six @-@ month healing coma . The game begins as the protagonist awakens from his coma , and finds that SHODAN has commandeered the station . All robots aboard have been reprogrammed for hostility , and the crew have been either mutated , transformed into cyborgs , or killed . 
 Rebecca Lansing , a TriOptimum counter @-@ terrorism consultant , contacts the player and claims that Citadel Station 's mining laser is being powered up to attack Earth . SHODAN 's plan is to destroy all major cities on the planet , in a bid to become a kind of god . Rebecca says that a certain crew member knows how to deactivate the laser , and promises to destroy the records of the hacker 's incriminating exchange with Diego if the strike is stopped . With information gleaned from log discs , the hacker destroys the laser by firing it into Citadel Station 's own shields . Foiled by the hacker 's work , SHODAN prepares to seed Earth with a mutagenic virus — the same one responsible for turning the station 's crew into mutants . The hacker , while attempting to jettison the chambers used to cultivate the virus , confronts and defeats Diego , who has been transformed into a powerful cyborg by SHODAN . Next , SHODAN begins an attempt to upload itself into Earth 's computer networks . Following Rebecca 's advice , the hacker prevents the download 's completion by destroying the four antennas that SHODAN is using to send data . 
 Soon after , Rebecca contacts the hacker , and says that she has convinced TriOptimum to authorize the station 's destruction ; she provides him with details on how to do this . After obtaining the necessary codes , the hacker initiates the station 's self @-@ destruct sequence and flees to the escape pod bay . There , the hacker defeats Diego a second time , then attempts to disembark . However , SHODAN prevents the pod from launching ; it seeks to keep the player aboard the station , while the bridge — which contains SHODAN — is jettisoned to a safe distance . Rebecca tells the hacker that he can still escape if he reaches the bridge ; SHODAN then intercepts and jams the transmission . After defeating Diego for the third time and killing him for good , the hacker makes it to the bridge as it is released from the main station , which soon detonates . He is then contacted by a technician who managed to circumvent SHODAN 's jamming signal . The technician informs him that SHODAN can only be defeated in cyberspace , due to the powerful shields that protect its mainframe computers . Using a terminal near the mainframe , the hacker enters cyberspace and destroys SHODAN . After his rescue , the hacker is offered a job at TriOptimum , but he declines in favor of continuing his life as a hacker .

 = = = Initial design = = = 
 System Shock was first conceived during the final stages of Ultima Underworld II : Labyrinth of Worlds ' development , between December 1992 and January 1993 . Designer and programmer Doug Church spent this period at the Texas headquarters of publisher Origin Systems , and discussions about Looking Glass Technologies ' next project occurred between him and producer Warren Spector , with input from designer Austin Grossman and company head Paul Neurath in Massachusetts . According to Church , the team believed that they had made " too many dungeon games " ; and Neurath later explained that they were experiencing burnout after the rushed development of Ultima Underworld II . As a result , they decided to create another " immersive simulation game " , but without a fantasy setting . They briefly considered placing the game in modern day , but Church said that the idea was rejected because " it [ would ] just beg so many questions : why can 't I pick up the phone , why can 't I get on the train , and so on " . Church returned to Looking Glass in Massachusetts , where he , Neurath and Grossman brainstormed possible science fiction settings for the game . According to Spector , the game was initially titled " Alien Commander " and was a spin @-@ off of the Wing Commander series ; however , this idea was soon replaced entirely . Spector said that they enjoyed not being attached to an existing franchise , because it meant that they " could basically do whatever [ they ] liked " . 
 The four collaborated to write numerous " minutes of gameplay " documents , which conveyed how the game would feel . Church later gave the example , " You hear the sound of a security camera swiveling , and then the beep of it acquiring you as a target , so you duck behind the crate and then you hear the door open so you throw a grenade and run out of the way " . The documents would " hint " at the gameplay systems involved , and at the emergent possibilities in each situation . Although Neurath was involved in these initial design sessions , he believed that the project " was always Doug Church 's vision at heart " . Church and Grossman refined several of the team 's documents and defined the game 's design and direction , and Grossman wrote the game 's original design document . Grossman built on ideas that he first explored while writing and designing Ultima Underworld II 's tomb dimension , which he later called a " mini @-@ prototype " for System Shock . These concepts included the minimization of dialogue trees and a greater focus on exploration . The team believed that dialogue trees " broke the fiction " of games ; Church later commented that the dialogue trees in the Ultima Underworld series were like separate games in themselves , disconnected from main experience of being immersed in the environment . There were also concerns about realism . 
 To eliminate dialogue trees from System Shock , the team prevented the player from ever meeting a living non @-@ player character ( NPC ) : the plot is instead conveyed by e @-@ mail messages and log discs , many of which were recorded by dead NPCs . Here , Grossman took influence from Edgar Lee Masters ' Spoon River Anthology , a collection of poems written as the epitaphs of fictional individuals . Grossman later summarized the idea as " a series of short speeches from people , that when put together , gave you a history of a place . " The removal of conversations was an attempt by the team to make the game a more " integrated whole " than was Ultima <unk> with a greater focus on immersion , atmosphere and " the feeling of ' being there ' " . They sought to " plunge [ players ] into the fiction and never provide an opportunity for breaking that fiction " ; and so they tried to erase the distinction between plot and exploration . Church considered this direction to be an organic progression from Ultima Underworld , and he later said , " On some level it 's still just a dungeon simulator , and we 're still just trying to evolve that idea . " Shortly before production began , Tribe bassist Greg LoPiccolo was contracted to work on the game 's music . He had visited his friend Rex Bradford at the company , and was spontaneously asked by the game 's programmers — many of whom were fans of the band — if he would take the role . The game entered production in February 1993 . Although Grossman was heavily involved in the game 's early planning , he had little to do with its production , aside from providing assistance with writing and voice acting . 
 = = = Production = = = 
 After production began , the team 's first task was to develop a new game engine — one that could display a true 3D environment and allow for advanced gameplay . The team abandoned the engine used for the Ultima Underworld games and coded one from scratch in <unk> C / C + + , using 32 @-@ bit code . The new engine is capable of processing texture maps , sloped architecture and light @-@ emitting objects ; and it allows the player to look in any direction , whereas Ultima Underworld 's engine was " very limited " in this regard . It also enables the player character to jump , crawl , climb walls and lean , among other things . The designers utilized loopholes in the engine 's renderer to create more diverse and striking environments . Despite having coded the renderer , Church said that " at first glance even I couldn 't see how they did them " . However , this added to the performance issues already being caused by the engine 's advanced nature , and the team struggled to optimize the game throughout development . 3D polygonal character models were planned , but they could not be implemented on schedule . Church said that the team 's ultimate goal was to create a " rich , exciting , active environment " in which the player could be immersed , and that this required " a coherent story and a world that you can interact with as much as possible . " 
 Church later said that the team " stumbled into a nice villain " with SHODAN , in that she could routinely and directly affect the player 's gameplay " in non @-@ final ways " . Through triggered events and through objects in the environment , such as security cameras that the player must destroy , the team made SHODAN 's presence part of the player 's exploration of the world . Because SHODAN interacts with the player as a " recurring , consistent , palpable enemy " , Church believed that she meaningfully connects the player to the story . System Shock concept artist Robb Waters created SHODAN 's visual design , and LoPiccolo recruited his bandmate Terri Brosius to voice the character . Brosius said that her goal during the recording sessions was to speak " without emotion , but with some up and down inflections " . Afterward , her voice was heavily edited in post @-@ production , which created a robotic effect inspired by the voice of Max Headroom . LoPiccolo later said that the large number of effects on Brosius 's voice were " laboriously hand @-@ done " with Sound Designer , which lacked the features that a sound editor would normally use to achieve such results . SHODAN 's dialogue early in the game was given " a few glitches " to hint at her corrupted status . LoPiccolo increased the number of these effects throughout the game , which creates an " arc " that ends with SHODAN " completely out of her mind [ ... and ] collapsing as an entity " . The character of the hacker arose as a reaction against the protagonist of the Ultima series , the Avatar . According to Grossman , they wanted to cast the player as someone " interestingly morally compromised " who had a stake in the situation . 
 Seamus Blackley designed the game 's physics system , which is a modified version of the one he wrote for Looking Glasses ' flight simulator Flight Unlimited . At the time , Church described it as " far more sophisticated than what you would normally use for an indoor game " . The system governs , among other things , weapon recoil and the arc of thrown objects ; the latter behave differently based on their weight and velocity . The game 's most complex physics model is that of the player character . Church explained that the character 's head " tilts forward when you start to run , and jerks back a bit when you stop " , and that , after an impact against a surface or object , its " head is knocked in the direction opposite the hit , with proportion to [ the ] mass and velocity of the objects involved " . On coding physics for Looking Glass Technologies games , Blackley later said , " If games don 't obey physics , we somehow feel that something isn 't right " , and that " the biggest compliment to me is when a gamer doesn 't notice the physics , but only notices that things feel the way they should " . 
 Spector 's role as a producer gave him the job of explaining the game to the publisher , which he called his " biggest challenge " . He explained that they " didn 't always get what the team was trying to do " , and said , " You don 't want to know how many times the game came this close to being killed ( or how late in the project ) " . According to Church , Looking Glass ' internal management largely ignored System Shock , in favor of the concurrently @-@ developed Flight Unlimited — the game " that had to be the hit , because it was the self @-@ published title " . Spector organized a licensing deal between Electronic Arts and Looking Glass that gave the former the trademark to the game , but the latter the copyright . His goal was to ensure that neither party could continue the franchise without the other 's involvement . While Cyberspace was originally conceived as a realistic hacking simulation — which could even be used to <unk> SHODAN 's ethical constraints — it was simplified after Origin Systems deemed it too complicated . The game 's star field system was written by programmer James Fleming . Marc LeBlanc was the main creator of the game 's HUD , which he later believed was too complicated . He said that it was " very much the Microsoft Word school of user interface " , in that there was no " feature that you [ could not ] see on the screen and touch and play with " . 
 LoPiccolo composed the game 's score — called " dark " , " electronic " and " cyberpunk " by the Boston Herald — on a Macintosh computer and inexpensive synthesizer , using Audio Vision . It dynamically changes according to the player 's actions , a decision made in keeping with the team 's focus on emergent gameplay . Each track was " written at three different intensity levels " , which change depending on the player 's nearness to enemies ; and certain events , such as victory in combat , trigger special music . The game 's tracks were composed of four @-@ bar segments that could be rearranged dynamically in reaction to game events , with " melodies through @-@ composed on top " . LoPiccolo noted that , when using this method , it is necessary to write music that " still flows with the overall theme and doesn 't jump around " . Because the score was closely tied to the gameplay , LoPiccolo had to work closely with Church and Rob Fermier , the latter of whom wrote the " interactive scoring module " that allowed for dynamic music . After recording the music , LoPiccolo recorded all of the game 's sound effects . He later recalled visiting an automobile repair shop with " portable recorder and a mic " , and " having [ his ] mechanic [ ... ] hit things with wrenches and so forth , just to get the raw material " . He developed the game 's audio over 16 months , working on a contractual basis until Tribe disbanded in May 1994 ; Ned Lerner gave him a full @-@ time job as audio director the next day . Tim Ries composed the " Elevator " music . 
 The original September 1994 floppy disk release of System Shock had no support for spoken dialogue . The enhanced CD @-@ ROM was released in December 1994 , which featured full speech for logs and e @-@ mails , multiple display resolutions , and more detailed graphics . The CD @-@ ROM version is often considered to be superior to the floppy version . After completing work on the sound and music for the floppy version , LoPiccolo recorded all of the spoken dialogue for the CD release , using company employees and his friends ' voices , which he mixed with ambient sounds to create " audio vignettes " . Doug Church later said , " We tried to keep them from shipping the floppy version and instead just ship the CD version , but Origin would have none of it " . System Shock producer Warren Spector later expressed regret concerning the floppy version , stating , " I wish I could go back and make the decision not to ship the floppy version months before the full @-@ speech CD version . The additional audio added so much it might as well have been a different game . The CD version seemed so much more , well , modern . And the perception of Shock was cemented in the press and in people 's minds by the floppy version ( the silent movie version ! ) . I really think that cost us sales ... "

 System Shock was critically acclaimed , and was given high scores by some of the gaming critics . On the review aggregator GameRankings , the game has an average score of 88 % . The game sold over 170 @,@ 000 copies . Maximum PC believed that the game did not reach " blockbuster " status , but was successful enough to " keep Looking Glass afloat " . GameSpy 's Bill Hiles said , " Though it sold well , it never reached the frenzied popularity of [ Doom ] " . Paul Neurath later said that the game " was not a flop " , but that it ultimately " lost money " for the company , which he attributed to its steep learning curve . Computer Gaming World praised the game 's scale , physics system , and true 3D environments ; the magazine extolled the presentation of Cyberspace as " nothing short of phenomenal " . However , the reviewer believed that the game had " little sense of urgency " and " confusing level layouts " . Computer Shopper wrote that , while the game 's controls were difficult to master compared to " simple run @-@ and @-@ shoot game [ s ] like Doom " , they were " worth the time and effort " . The reviewer noted that the game " grows on you , and it will keep you intrigued for weeks " . 
 The Boston Herald noted superficial similarities between System Shock and Doom , but called System Shock " much more elaborate " . The reviewer noted its high system requirements and complex controls ; of the latter , he said , " There 's no way you can play System Shock without first studying the manual for at least 20 minutes " . The paper believed that the game would " set a new standard for computer games with its combination of action and puzzle @-@ solving " . The Atlanta Journal @-@ Constitution said that the game " is like a well @-@ prepared hamburger — familiar stuff , but good to the last byte " . The reviewer noted the game 's " somewhat clumsy control " , but said , " That , however , is all I can find to complain about . Graphics and sound are outstanding , and the game is well @-@ paced and riveting " . 
 PC Gamer US wrote , " System Shock smokes . It is the most fully immersive game world I have ever experienced " . The reviewer praised the game 's story and control system , and believed that " no matter what kind of game you 're looking for , you 'll find something in System Shock to delight you " . He finished his review by stating that the game " unquestionably raises computer gaming to a new level " .

 Shortly after the release of the Enhanced Edition , Night Dive announced their plans to develop a reimagining of System Shock as a new title for Microsoft Windows , Xbox One and PlayStation 4 , featuring improved art assets and other improvements , and reworking the game to use the Unity game engine . Originally announced as System Shock Remastered , Night Dive has opted to simply name the new game System Shock as they consider the effort they are putting into the title makes it more of a reboot of the franchise rather than a remastering of the original game . Veteran designer Chris Avellone and members of the Fallout : New Vegas development team will help with the game . 
 Night Dive plans to fund the development of the game through a Kickstarter campaign that started on June 28 , 2016 , with a goal of $ 900 @,@ 000 . Alongside the Kickstarter campaign , the studio released a free demo featuring an early build of the first level of the game , exhibiting their efforts so far on the project and intended to " demonstrate [ their ] commitment and passion " to faithfully rebooting the game . As of July 9 , 2016 , the studio 's campaign has been successfully funded and the title is expected to release in December 2017 .

On February 10 , 2016 Night Dive Studios announced that the recovered source code of the game will be released to the game 's community . 
 = M @-@ 95 ( Michigan highway ) = 
 M @-@ 95 , designated the Leif Erickson Memorial Highway , is a state trunkline highway in the Upper Peninsula of the US state of Michigan . Running from Kingsford to near Champion in Humboldt Township , it is the main connection between Iron Mountain and Marquette along with US 41 . 
 M @-@ 95 was previously designated as M @-@ 45 . The number was switched when US 45 was designated in Michigan . The trunkline incorporates a portion of the former M @-@ 12 which became US 2 . A section of the highway near Republic was turned over to Marquette County during a rerouting of the highway in the 1940s , becoming County Road 601 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 Starting on a bridge across the Menominee River , M @-@ 95 runs north along Carpenter Avenue in Kingsford . It turns east along Ludington Street in Iron Mountain and joins the US 2 / US 141 concurrency out of town to the north , following Stephenson Avenue . Near the state line northwest of Iron Mountain , M @-@ 95 turns northward as a solo route through northern Dickinson County . There is a concurrency with M @-@ 69 from Randville to Sagola . Randville is just south of the junction with M @-@ 69 where the mining settlement formed because of the nearby Groveland Mine and was a station on the Milwaukee and Northern Railroad in 1880 . A post office was in operation in Randville from 1891 until 1932 . 
 Near Sagola is a mill owned by Louisiana @-@ Pacific that makes oriented strand board . The surrounding forest lands near the highway provide trees for the mill . Sagola was formed , when in about 1885 , five Chicago men formed the Sagola Lumber Company to harvest pine timber in the area . The name was derived from the local Indian word for " welcome " . A post office was first established there in 1889 . North of Sagola is the community of Channing which began as a railroad junction called " Fort Siding " . In 1892 , a post office was established named Channing , after John Parke Channing , a mining engineer who surveyed the area . 
 M @-@ 95 crosses the Michigamme River at the Marquette County line . It is here that M @-@ 95 also crosses over from the Central Time Zone to the Eastern Time Zone at the county line south of Witch Lake . From there it bypasses Republic and the former Republic Mine Complex to the west . Republic is divided into two smaller communities of North Republic and South Republic by the mine complex . Known for its sandy beachfront along the Michigamme River west of downtown North Republic , the beach is located just upstream of the Republic Dam . In South Republic is a roadside park maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) that provides a picnic area and canoe access to the river . M @-@ 95 comes to an end north of a railroad crossing at an intersection with US 41 / M @-@ 28 named " Koski 's Korner " . 
 = = History = = 
 From its inception until 1934 , M @-@ 95 held the M @-@ 45 designation . It was renumbered to avoid confusion with the then new US 45 designation in the Upper Peninsula . The original M @-@ 95 was an access route to Onaway State Park which was redesignated as M @-@ 211 . 
 The original roadway that became today 's M @-@ 95 started in Sagola and run northward to M @-@ 15 ( today US 41 / M @-@ 28 ) . M @-@ 45 was extended by 1927 to replace portions of M @-@ 12 that were not used in US 2 . It would later be extended in 1932 to the state line south of Kingsford . The total of M @-@ 45 was converted to M @-@ 95 in 1934 as a realignment near Witch Lake is completed . 
 M @-@ 95 was rerouted in 1942 from Republic north to Humboldt Township . This new 7 @-@ mile ( 11 km ) section replaced the last section of gravel roadway that was transferred to Marquette County as County Road 601 . Another rerouting in the Republic area moved the trunkline in 1957 to bypass South Republic . The former roadway was partially closed to become part of the Republic Mine . M @-@ 69 was shortened , eliminating the concurrency with M @-@ 95 in 1960 or 1961 . M @-@ 69 was re @-@ extended back to its pre @-@ 1960 routing in 1991 , restoring the concurrency in the process .

 = Clifton Bridge railway station = 
 Clifton Bridge railway station is a former railway station in the Bower Ashton district of Bristol , England , near the River Avon . It was opened in 1867 by the Bristol and Portishead Pier and Railway Company as a single platform stop 3 @.@ 4 miles ( 5 @.@ 5 km ) along the line from Bristol to Portishead . It was later taken over by the Great Western Railway and had a second platform added . 
 Passenger services at the station declined following the Second World War , and the Beeching Report recommended the complete closure of the Portishead line . Passenger services at Clifton Bridge ended on 7 September 1964 , with goods services following on 5 July 1965 , although the line saw occasional traffic until 1981 . Most of the station was demolished , leaving some remains of the platforms , a retaining wall and the footbridge . Regular freight trains through the station began to run again in 2002 when Royal Portbury Dock was connected to the rail network . The line is due to be reopened to passenger traffic in 2019 as part of MetroWest , but there are no plans to reopen the station . 
 = = History = = 
 Clifton Bridge railway station was opened on 18 April 1867 by the Bristol and Portishead Pier and Railway Company , when services began on their line from the Bristol and Exeter Railway at Portishead Junction to a pier on the Severn Estuary at Portishead . The line was built as 7 ft ( 2 @,@ 134 mm ) broad @-@ gauge , and was largely single track . The station was sited in Bower Ashton at the southern end of the Avon Gorge , at the bottom of Rownham Hill and near the western bank of the river . The station , which took its name from the nearby Clifton Suspension Bridge , was 8 miles 42 chains ( 13 @.@ 7 km ) from the line 's terminus at Portishead , 3 miles 32 chains ( 5 @.@ 5 km ) from Bristol Temple Meads and 121 miles 63 chains ( 196 @.@ 0 km ) from the Great Western Railway 's terminus at London Paddington . To the north , the railway ran along the riverbank in the gorge , and to the south through fields just outside the Bristol conurbation . The station was initially the first along the line from Portishead Junction , before Portbury . 
 When it opened , the station had a single platform , on the west side of the track . Road access was through a large forecourt to the west from <unk> Road / Rownham Hill , now the A369 . There was a two @-@ storey building facing the road , the ground floor of which had a single long room , partitioned into a waiting room , booking office and station master 's office . The ground floor also housed a coal @-@ fired boiler and washing facilities , while upstairs was spacious living accommodation accessed by a private staircase . A single north @-@ facing bay platform for goods vans was at the north end of the station . The station was noted as having an excellent garden alongside the platform . The nearby Rownham Ferry allowed passengers to cross the river to Hotwells and Clifton . Services on the Portishead railway were operated by the Bristol and Exeter Railway , with six trains per day in each direction on weekdays and one on Sundays . The operation of these transferred to the Great Western in 1876 , when they took over the Bristol and Exeter , and in 1884 the Great Western took ownership of the Bristol and Portishead . The station was visited by Albert Edward , Prince of Wales , in 1878 . 
 The station saw major works at the beginning of the 1880s . From 24 to 27 January 1880 , the line was relaid as 4 ft 8 1 ⁄ 2 in ( 1 @,@ 435 mm ) standard gauge , and on 15 September 1880 a passing loop was brought into use through the station , east of the original track , with a new platform serving it . The new platform had a large shelter and a small signal cabin immediately south of the shelter , with a footbridge at the south end linking it to the original platform . Both platforms had " half barrel " canopies added . The new " down " platform served trains towards Bristol , while the original " up " platform now served trains towards Portishead . The double track through the station was extended to Portishead Junction from 1883 . The station 's name was changed to Rownham in March 1891 , but reverted to Clifton Bridge in 1910 . In 1899 the station was flooded to a depth of several feet ( one metre ) , as were other parts of Bristol . A new signal box with 27 levers was built at the south end of the western platform , with the original cabin taken out of use from 25 August 1907 . The signal box contained three token instruments , connected to the line 's other signal boxes at Oakwood , Pill and Portishead , so that the Pill or Oakwood boxes could be switched out . The boxes at Clifton Bridge and Portishead were manned 24 hours a day . By 1889 , services had increased to nine trains in each direction on weekdays and one on Sundays , and from 1909 this increased to 13 on weekdays and two on Sundays . 
 In June 1914 , the station played a major role in bringing passengers to the Bristol International Exhibition , known locally as the White City , held on Ashton Meadows to the south @-@ east of the station . The exhibition came to an early end due to the outbreak of the First World War , as the buildings were used for troop barracks . The station had earlier that year seen the discovery of a decapitated corpse , later identified as prominent local solicitor Edward Payne Press . The death was ruled a suicide by means of lying down in front of a train . The war saw the establishment of a mule depot , which handled mule traffic from the docks before the animals were transported to military installations such as at Shirehampton or Salisbury Plain . From 1917 the station was closed on Sundays as a wartime economy measure . 
 After the war , services increased , and from 8 July 1929 a half @-@ hourly service operated along the line : two trains per hour to Portishead , one to Ashton Gate and one to Bristol Temple Meads , equating to 21 trains per day on weekdays . On Sundays eight trains per day operated . There were eight staff assigned to the station in the 1930s , and in 1944 three carriage sidings were laid at the south end of the station . 
 The Portishead line again saw a rise in use during the Second World War , as Bristolians evacuated to the more rural areas of Pill and Portishead commuted in to work , many alighting at Clifton Bridge and walking across the Cumberland Basin bridges , the Rownham Ferry now obsolete . During air raids , people would sleep aboard carriages in the station sidings , or in Clifton Bridge No. 1 tunnel north of the station . The station was also used during the war for timber traffic from the local woodlands , loaded onto trains by members of the Women 's Land Army . Other freight traffic included goods from the Ashton Containers factory and a local firm dealing in herbal medicine . 
 When the railways were nationalised in 1948 , Clifton Bridge came under the aegis of the Western Region of British Railways . Services had reduced by 1949 to 13 trains per day on weekdays and seven on Sundays , and passenger numbers fell . The station became an unstaffed halt from 29 October 1962 , and in 1963 , the Beeching report suggested the complete withdrawal of services along the line . Passenger services at Clifton Bridge were ended on 7 September 1964 , with goods services ending the next year on 5 July 1965 . In the final year of passenger operation , there were only six trains on weekdays and none on Sundays . One of the carriage sidings had been taken out of service in 1964 , and the others followed in 1966 . The line through the site was reduced to single track in 1965 , and the signal box was closed on 4 November 1966 . The station buildings were mostly demolished , and the site became the headquarters of the Avon and Somerset Constabulary Mounted Police and Dog Section . Part of the western platform remained in situ , as did the retaining wall of the eastern platform shelter . The station footbridge became part of a footpath . Freight trains continued to pass through the station , but their number decreased over time , with the line falling out of regular use from 30 March 1981 . The route however was kept intact by British Rail , with occasional freight trains , and in 2002 a single track was relaid to allow rail access to Royal Portbury Dock . 
 = = Future = = 
 The Portishead Branch Line is to be reopened as part of the MetroWest scheme , a rail transport plan which aims to enhance transport capacity in the Bristol area . The scheme was given the go @-@ ahead in July 2012 as part of the City Deal , whereby local councils would be given greater control over money by the government . A consultation on the plans was held between 22 June and 3 August 2015 to gather views from the community and stakeholders before moving on to detailed designs . The detailed proposals will be subject to a second consultation before the plans are finalised . Due to the additional capital costs , the line will not be electrified , but the design will include passive provision for future electrification . The station at Clifton Bridge is not being considered for reopening , but the line in the area will be increased to double track . The line is expected to reopen in 2019 . 
 Trains along the reopened line will operate between Portishead and Bristol Temple Meads , with two trains per hour in each direction . Services would call at Pill and Parson Street , with aspirations to also call at Bedminster and a reopened Ashton Gate . Trains could also be extended on to the Severn Beach Line . The trains used will be diesel multiple units , likely three carriages long . The line will be operated as part of the Greater Western passenger franchise . Great Western Railway , a subsidiary of FirstGroup , operates the Greater Western franchise . Their contract expires in early 2019 , before services to Portishead are due to start .

He has expressed his pleasure in working and bonding with the four different dogs who played his canine co @-@ star . The film received mixed reviews , although critics were favorable to Hutcherson . Following the film , Carrie Rickey of The Philadelphia Inquirer referred to him as the " Jodie Foster of Generation Y " , remarking that with " each successive film Hutcherson dives deeper into his reservoir of shame and hurt and hope , unnerving for one so young , but also unusually urgent for an actor of any age . " 
 In 2008 , he appeared in the independent crime drama Winged Creatures ( released as Fragments on DVD ) alongside Dakota Fanning as they portrayed two teenage friends who survive a massacre , and in Journey to the Center of the Earth , a 3D film adaptation of the novel of the same name where he portrayed a teen who travels to Iceland with an uncle he hardly knows , played by Brendan Fraser . Over the next two years , he appeared as a boy named Steve " Leopard " Leonard who visits a freak show with his friends in the vampire fiction film adaptation of the book Cirque du Freak and had a supporting role in the critically acclaimed The Kids Are All Right , portraying the son of a lesbian couple , played by Annette Bening and Julianne Moore . According to Kaleem Aftab of The Independent , his role in the film was a pivotal point in his career and one of vital importance to continuing his career into adulthood . Hutcherson expressed gratitude at being cast in the film , displaying satisfaction with the intimacy and creative freedom that independent films provide over studio films . The film won the Golden Globe Award for Best Motion Picture – Musical or Comedy in 2010 , and was a nominee for Best Picture at the 83rd Academy Awards . Gregory Ellwood of entertainment site HitFix stated : " Hutcherson 's charismatic wit and natural instincts shine and it 's arguably the first film where he proves he 's more than just another sharp @-@ looking teen actor .

 On April 4 , 2011 , Lionsgate announced that Hutcherson had been cast as Peeta Mellark in The Hunger Games series , opposite Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen . He was eager to land the role , feeling that he related to the character extremely well . In preparation for filming , he had to bleach his hair and gain 15 pounds . Lawrence , a close friend , has always spoken highly of him as an actor ; in regards to his portrayal of Peeta Mellark she stated , " He 's charming , he 's sweet , he 's down to earth , he 's normal . He embodies all of it and brings it all to Peeta ... he 's got all those great qualities and every single one of them comes across in every line he says out loud as Peeta . " He became known for his pranks on set , leading to an accident as he was play @-@ fighting with Lawrence who kicked him in the head , unintentionally knocking him unconscious and giving him a concussion . The initial film , The Hunger Games , was released on March 23 , 2012 , and went on to become one of the highest @-@ grossing films of the year . Hutcherson received the MTV Movie Award for " Best Male Performance " . He was also awarded the 2012 NewNowNext award for " Next Mega Star " and the National Association of Theatre Owners 's 2012 CinemaCon award for " Breakthrough Performer of the Year " . Peter Travers of Rolling Stone described the actor 's portrayal saying , " [ Hutcherson ] brings humor and a bruised heart to a boy who needs to mature fast . " 
 Between landing the role in The Hunger Games and the film 's release , he played a lead role and served as an executive producer for two films : Detention ( 2011 ) and The Forger ( 2012 ) . In Detention , he played the role of popular teenager Clapton Davis in a film the plot of which has been compared to 1985 's The Breakfast Club . His role in The Forger was as a 15 @-@ year @-@ old orphan who finds himself in trouble until Alfred Molina 's character comes to his aid . The film was not well received but the actors ' chemistry together and their performance was . He next reprised his role as Sean Anderson in the 2012 Journey to the Center of the Earth sequel , Journey 2 : The Mysterious Island . Hutcherson has always been vocal about his desire to work on films of all sorts of genres . Regarding the switch from comedy @-@ drama The Kids Are All Right to the Journey sequel , he stated : " For me , I like to do all different types of films and to go from having that awesome [ indie ] kind of thing that I love doing so much with great characters and a really great script to a bigger kind of studio film , to just cover the whole kind of spectrum of movies is really , really cool . " Although the film was largely panned , it fared well commercially and his performance was well received , with Kofi Outlaw of <unk> appreciating how he " does a good job holding the screen and portraying a somewhat layered protagonist " . Later in 2012 , he appeared in Red Dawn , a remake of the 1984 film of the same name . The film was panned by critics , achieving only a 12 percent approval rating on Rotten Tomatoes , the lowest score of any film Hutcherson has acted in . 
 In 2013 , Hutcherson voiced the character Nod in the animated action @-@ adventure 3D film Epic , loosely based on William Joyce 's book , The Leaf Men and the Brave Good Bugs ; the film is his most commercially successful except for The Hunger Games series . As filming approached for The Hunger Games sequel , The Hunger Games : Catching Fire , he enlisted celebrity trainer Bobby Strom to assist him in five hour @-@ long workouts per week . The film brought in $ 420 million at the North American box office , making it his most commercially successful film . Todd Gilchrist of Indiewire proclaimed of the actor 's performance that " Hutcherson 's maturing talents achieve a parallelism with the character 's self @-@ actualization , proving subtler and more self @-@ aware with every resigned decision he makes on behalf of the people around him that he loves . " Hutcherson received his second MTV Movie Award for " Best Male Performance " for his role in the sequel . 
 On November 23 , 2013 , the day following The Hunger Games : Catching Fire 's United States release , Hutcherson hosted an episode of Saturday Night Live . His performance received mediocre reviews , with Mike Ryan of The Huffington Post stating that he did not really bring " anything special to the table except having a nice attitude " , and John <unk> of GQ remarking that " while the night didn 't necessarily disappoint , it also didn 't dazzle " . 
 Hutcherson again reprised his role in the two feature @-@ length parts of the Mockingjay film adaptation . The Hunger Games : Mockingjay – Part 1 was released on November 21 , 2014 , and Part 2 followed on November 20 , 2015 . His character goes through a significant personality change in the films , which provided him with an acting challenge ; he said , " I 'm nervous about portraying it because I 've never gone crazy before in a movie . " Emily Yahr of The Washington Post spoke positively of his acting , by saying " Peeta 's crazed expression is sure to haunt our nightmares for a long time , " while David Edelstein of New York criticized his portrayal in relation to scenes with the other characters , saying " at least Josh Hutcherson 's captured Peeta is mostly seen in interviews with Stanley Tucci 's camp talk @-@ show host on TV screens ... so the actor can 't bring his lack of urgency to scenes with [ Jennifer Lawrence ] . " 
 Before filming the Mockingjay movies , Hutcherson filmed Escobar : Paradise Lost , a French @-@ Spanish romantic thriller film , which was released on January 16 , 2015 , in the U.S. He also served as an executive producer for the film , alongside first @-@ time director Andrea Di Stefano , assisting with casting and blocking shots . Hutcherson said the opportunity " made [ him ] so hungry to do more like that " . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Hutcherson has cited actor Jake Gyllenhaal as an inspiration , admiring the way Gyllenhaal " has taken his career and the kind of jobs that he 's taken " . He has also named actor , director , and producer Philip Seymour Hoffman as another of his inspirations . 
 Hutcherson currently lives in Los Angeles , California . In May 2012 , he purchased the 1 @,@ 861 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 172 @.@ 9 m2 ) $ 2 @.@ 5 million former house of Heath Ledger in Laurel Canyon in the Hollywood Hills , a small ranch built in 1951 . He professes that his fame has not changed him as a person , stating , " I love my job more than anything in the world and I could never imagine doing anything else . So this whole thing is a very small price to pay compared to someone who has to go to an office to work . " 
 As a known ally to the LGBT ( lesbian , gay , bisexual , and transgender ) community , Hutcherson advocates the gay – straight alliance campaign " Straight But Not Narrow " . Since its formation , he has been its most active supporter . His involvement with the LGBT community stems from his family ties ; two of his uncles who were gay died of AIDS @-@ related illnesses . In April 2012 , he became the youngest recipient of the Vanguard Award from GLAAD , given for promoting equal rights for LGBT people . He was also awarded with Young Humanitarian Award at the 2015 <unk> : humanity award ceremony .

 = Hotel Valley Ho = 
 Hotel Valley Ho is a historic hotel in Scottsdale , Arizona . Also called the Valley Ho and , for 28 years , the Ramada Valley Ho , the hotel was originally designed by Edward L. Varney , a student of Frank Lloyd Wright . It first opened in 1956 with a forward @-@ looking and futuristic design . Movie stars and famous baseball players stayed , and the building quickly became known for its trendsetting guests and its fashionable atmosphere . The success of the venture resulted in expansion in 1958 , with two additional two @-@ story wings of guest rooms extending to the north . Though initially proposed by Varney , a central tower of guest rooms , rising over the lobby , was not built . 
 The property was bought by the Ramada hotel chain in 1973 , and was redecorated to cover the 1950s design , seen at the time as outdated . No longer in vogue , but centrally located , the hotel remained prominent for years , and hosted conferences , business meetings , and vacationers . Under Ramada management , however , the property began to show a lack of maintenance , and its popularity declined . It closed in 2001 and its demolition was considered when no purchase offers were received . Admirers of the hotel 's exemplary architecture and its local history rallied to save it , and it was placed on the Scottsdale Historic Register . 
 In 2002 , the hotel was bought by <unk> Hotels & Resorts and underwent a renovation , which was completed in 2005 . Conceived anew by the architectural firm Allen + Philp , a seven @-@ story tower with guest rooms and condominiums was built above the lobby , in the spirit of Varney 's proposal . New restaurants were incorporated , including a retro @-@ chic seasonal @-@ American restaurant ( <unk> ) , and a Trader Vic 's franchise at the northeast end of the property ( closed in 2011 ) . The hotel 's original jet @-@ age design was restored as much as possible , augmented with 2000s @-@ era fixtures . 
 The Hotel Valley Ho is a AAA " Four Diamond Award " winner and a member of " Preferred Hotels & Resorts " . Author and architect Alan Hess called the hotel " one of the best @-@ preserved mid @-@ century hotels in the country " . 
 = = History = = 
 Robert and Evelyn Foehl were the first to conceive of the hotel . Robert Foehl trained at the Biltmore Hotel in Los Angeles , California . He then bought the Hotel San Marcos in Chandler , Arizona . Following that , he managed the <unk> Inn in Scottsdale . Evelyn Foehl managed the Hacienda del Sol in Tucson as one of the few women in the hotel business . The two established a core of investors to build a new hotel on an 8 @.@ 86 @-@ acre ( 3 @.@ 59 ha ) site in Scottsdale and to design it , they hired Edward L. Varney , one of the most prominent local architects of the time . Varney set the hotel around a central pool lounge and used extended horizontal lines in the wings where rooms included air conditioning for year @-@ round operation , a first for Scottsdale . A curving porte @-@ cochere with abstract Southwestern designs in cast concrete opened onto a high @-@ ceiling lobby which gave guests a " sense of arrival " , a feature often used by Frank Lloyd Wright . The tall lobby connected the guests to a restaurant , a lounge , a nightclub , and the central pool . The interior design was conceived and executed by interior architect Thelma Hawkins , the director of Barker Bros. Phoenix Studio of Interior Design . The project was completed on December 20 , 1956 at a cost of $ 1 @.@ 5 million , an amount equivalent to $ 13 @.@ 1 million in current value . 
 Varney added an unusual feature for a hotel of the time : a parking lot . The parking lot afforded guests the personal comfort and freedom of pulling their car up very close to their rooms . This was the first motor resort in Scottsdale . 
 The Foehls held a contest in March 1956 to name the as @-@ yet @-@ uncompleted hotel . They specified that the name should have a " westward flavor " like its parent , the Westward Ho in Phoenix . The winning name " Valley Ho " was selected because the location was at the periphery of Paradise Valley , an affluent area , and because the identical " Ho " connected the new hotel with the older one in Phoenix . Later , it was discovered that ho means " you are welcomed here , this is a friendly place " in a local aboriginal American language . 
 The Foehls knew many in the Hollywood film industry , and a number of film stars stayed at the hotel . In late December 1957 , Robert Wagner and Natalie Wood celebrated their wedding reception at the hotel . Bette Davis , Roy Rogers , Bing Crosby , Frankie Avalon , Humphrey Bogart , Betty Grable , Janet Leigh , Marilyn Monroe , Zsa Zsa Gabor , Ingrid Bergman , Cary Grant , and Tony Curtis were known to have stayed there . Sometimes late at night , Jimmy Durante would come down from his room to play the piano in the lounge for other sleepless guests . The Foehls ran the hotel very closely — they lived on the premises . 
 Local Scottsdale corporation Motorola used the hotel to house its transferred employees while they looked for permanent residences . Some of the baseball players , coaches , and managers taking part in the spring training Cactus League of Arizona stayed at the hotel , including Joe DiMaggio , Ted Williams , and Leo Durocher , the latter requesting Room 103 every time he visited , for its nearness to the lobby . Chicago @-@ based sports reporter Dave Hoekstra writes that he and his " Bleacher Bum " colleagues did not have enough money to stay under the same roof as the baseball players they were watching , and instead crowded into rooms at the Safari motel next door ( since razed ) . Hoekstra notes that , throughout the 1960s , " the Ho was the high @-@ roller place in the Sun Valley " . 
 The Valley Ho competed favorably with the Safari Hotel , erected about the same time east of Scottsdale Fashion Square . Both hotels offered premium hospitality , and helped Scottsdale expand its public image . With the Valley Ho an immediate financial success , in 1958 Varney designed and built two more wings of guest rooms to the northwest of the original complex . The same materials and style were employed on the expansion buildings , but instead of single exterior corridors with rooms to one side , the added wings loaded central corridors with rooms on both sides . Another Scottsdale landmark hotel , the Mountain Shadows Resort , opened the following year , in 1959 . These three tourist havens reflected a desired cosmopolitan and exotic feel on Scottsdale . 
 = = Renovation = = 
 In 1973 , Robert Foehl died and Evelyn Foehl sold the hotel to Ramada , a hotel chain . The Ramada managers remodeled the hotel , stripping out and covering much of what they considered an outdated interior . The hotel was named Ramada Valley Ho . Though it remained a fashionable location for a while , its original character was largely absent and it began to suffer from neglect and disrepair . It continued to host conferences and business meetings , such as the Natural Health , <unk> and Herb Conference & Trade Show in early 2000 , and the Arizona <unk> 's League party in early 2001 . Later that year , the hotel closed and was put on the market . Plans for its demolition were considered when no offers were made . To protect it , Alan Hess wrote a letter detailing its importance , and a successful campaign was mounted in Scottsdale to place it on the Scottsdale Historic Register in recognition of its significance to city history and its architectural connection to the past . To save it from demolition , business partners Scott Lyon and Bill <unk> of <unk> Hotels & Resorts bought the property and undertook an extensive renovation and building addition that eventually cost $ <unk> . Evelyn Foehl died in August 2003 , two years after the hotel was closed for renovation . 
 The local Scottsdale architectural firm Allen + Philp accepted the task of renovation , and in researching the hotel 's history , they found that in the 1950s , Varney had originally intended a tower of guest rooms to rise above the central lobby , a feature that was not built at the time . Allen + Philp designed a seven @-@ story tower for the purpose of giving the new hotel owners a chance of greater financial viability . Architect Mark Philp said of the project , " We worked to stay true to the spirit of the original . " Interior designer Cole @-@ Martinez carefully updated the decorations and furnishings with " one foot firmly in the present with subtle salutes to the past " . Chicago reporter Hoekstra happily noted that the renovation retained the original " Jetsons @-@ in @-@ the @-@ desert flavor " . The hotel re @-@ opened on December 20 , 2005 , exactly 49 years after its first grand opening . 
 = = Amenities = = 
 The hotel operates one restaurant and has a wide selection of guest rooms and suites in addition to over 30 luxury condominiums for permanent residents . The condos range from 1 @,@ 450 to 2 @,@ 400 square feet ( 135 to 223 m2 ) . The location is 15 minutes by car from Phoenix Sky Harbor International Airport and from Arizona State University . Hotel Valley Ho earned a " Four Diamond Award " from AAA each year 2007 – 2009 , and after passing the " Standards of Excellence " was invited to join Preferred Hotels and Resorts in 2006 . The Valley Ho is a top @-@ ten @-@ ranked Scottsdale property on TripAdvisor.com , topping even the renowned five @-@ star Phoenician Resort . In a nod to " Mad Men , " the widely acclaimed television series that takes place largely during the Valley Ho 's original heyday , one TripAdvisor reviewer noted : " Don Draper would approve . " 
 Centrally placed in the main lobby , <unk> is a restaurant that offers seasonal American food . Executive Chef Charles Wiley compared the hotel restaurant renovation project with its long , curving counter , soda fountain and pie case to the careful rebuilding of " an old Harley @-@ Davidson , " with new features complementing vintage ones . Food and drinks are also served at the OH Pool Bar + <unk> . 
 There are 21 large studio rooms which feature a bathroom separated only by a curtain . Eleven cabana rooms overlooking the pool come with a double @-@ sized patio . Two executive suites and three terrace suites include an 800 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 74 m2 ) balcony or patio . 
 Since its renovation , Jamie Foxx , Eddie Van Halen , and Korn have stayed at the hotel , and Robert Wagner has returned from time to time . 
 = = Architectural style = = 
 The Hotel Valley Ho is a striking example of the mid @-@ century modern architectural style . Varney 's use of masonry , cast and poured concrete , natural stone , and wide expanses of glass make for a close connection between the building and its environment . Stone floor and wall patterns link the exterior entry and the lobby , as does the extension of the redwood ceiling . The hotel is now considered one of the finest examples of organic architecture . Rooms in the two adjacent wings added in the late 1950s are unusual , and remarkably forward @-@ thinking even by mid @-@ century design standards , for their high nine @-@ foot @-@ ceilings . The prevailing trend at the time of original construction was low @-@ ceilinged rooms , in some cases with ceilings only seven feet above ground level , but the Valley Ho 's rooms feel exceptionally roomy and airy thanks to its original decision to buck design trends . 
 The repeated horizontal rows of V @-@ shaped burnished red concrete forms resemble abstract arrowheads . These precast forms , extending horizontally , give a modest " Southwestern " or " American Indian " flavor to the building . 
 During the renovation , walls and coverings were stripped away to reveal 1950s features . <unk> was removed from guest room walls to highlight the original masonry bricks . Walls partitioning the central lobby were torn down to open up Varney 's intended connection between the indoor and outdoor public spaces . Concrete columns in the lobby were stripped of mirrors added by Ramada so as to show their original design . 
 The hotel offers a 90 @-@ minute architectural tour , available by appointment and led by experts from Ultimate Art & Cultural Tours of Scottsdale . The tour is focused on the hotel 's design and Hollywood past , and includes a look inside some of the restored rooms , a walk around the grounds , and a stop at the Sky Line Rooftop for wonderful views of Phoenix and Scottsdale .

 The episode was written by consulting producer Jessica Sharzer and directed by Bradley Buecker .

 After the episode aired , Murphy spoke of his plans to change the cast and location for the second season .

" The people that are coming back will be playing completely different characters , creatures , monsters , etc . [ The Harmons ] stories are done . People who are coming back will be playing entirely new characters , " he announced . 
 In an interview with Entertainment Weekly , Murphy commented on the structure of the series ' first season . " I loved how it began . I loved it in the middle and I loved the end . The only thing really frustrating for me , to be honest with you , is that sometimes people would write this idea that we were making it up as we went along and I wanted to say , ' Really ? ' But I think now people are writing and saying , ' Oh yeah ! ' I 'm excited for people to see it on DVD , because now that they know how it ended , [ they can ] go back and see all of the little things , like people who have no reflections in mirrors . When you go back , you will see everything was set up . " When asked if the House " pulled " the Harmons to it , Murphy responded : " I don 't know if they were targeted . I don 't think the Internet site had any supernatural pull to it ... although that would have been hilarious . I thought it was two things : it was house porn because I think that house really is extraordinary . And also I think there 's always that allure in American lives of the fresh start , moving West , starting fresh . "

 = Haley Farm State Park = 
 Haley Farm State Park is a Connecticut state park preserving Colonial @-@ era farmland as open space in the town of Groton . It was the site of a dairy farm owned by Caleb Haley . The land was sold to A. C. White in 1953 who developed Mumford Cove and sold 198 acres to the State of Connecticut for $ 300 @,@ 000 in July 1970 . In 1975 , a bike trail from Mystic to Noank was established and part of it goes through the Haley Farm State Park . Another 57 acres were purchased for a total of $ 913 @,@ 300 and added to the park in 2002 . The Haley Farm State Park includes 267 acres that is directly connected to Bluff Point Coastal Reserve through a pedestrian bridge over railroad tracks . The park is reserved for activities such as bicycling and walking . The facilities only include pit toilets . 
 = = History = = 
 Land containing the acreage for Haley Farm State Park was part of a larger parcel granted to John Winthrop Jr . , in 1648 or 1649 . Winthrop , known better as " John Winthrop the Younger " , was governor of the Saybrook Colony and often recognized as " Connecticut 's first governor " . The land was later split up , and the piece which contained Haley Farm was designated Fort Hill Farm . The farm was purchased by Starr Chester in 1789 and passed to Noyes Barber in 1833 . The land was split again in 1852 with the farm being sold to Henry B. Lewis . Four hundred acres were sold to Caleb Haley in 1869 for the price of $ 12 @,@ 000 . Haley farmed the land , built stone walls throughout the property and raced horses around " Racetrack Pond " . The land passed to his son , Samuel Haley , after his death in 1924 . Samuel Haley continued to operate the farm until his death in 1947 , when it was passed to his daughter Juliet Haley . The farm produced cream and milk that was shipped to Noank , West Mystic and Mystic . In 1953 , the farm was sold out of the Haley family to A. C. White who abandoned the farm to develop a gully called Mumford Cove . Mr. White placed the 250 @-@ acre parcel of land containing Haley Farm for sale . In 1960 , the homestead burned down and the other buildings eventually were demolished in 1973 after being documented for possible future reconstruction . 
 In 1963 , efforts were made to purchase the land to prevent it from being developed . The town opposed re @-@ zoning it to multi @-@ residential for Algernon @-@ Blair 's development plan . The land was sold from Alcor Inc. to O & G Construction Co. as a 250 acre parcel in 1966 . A total of 198 acres of land was returned to Mr. White after O & G Construction " were in arrears on their payments and back taxes " . In July 1970 , the state acquired 198 acres of Haley Farm from A. C. White for a total of $ 300 @,@ 000 . The money was the result of federal funding for $ 150 @,@ 000 , state funding for $ 100 @,@ 000 , and the remaining $ 50 @,@ 000 came from the Groton Open Space Association , a local organization that completed raising the required funds in early 1970 . At the time , the Park and Forest Commission said there were no plans to make it into a park . However , the Department of Energy and Environmental Protection recognizes that Haley Farm was officially made a Connecticut State Park in July 1970 . 
 In 1975 , a bike trail from Mystic to Noank was established and part of it goes through the Haley Farm State Park . In 1981 , a $ 27 @,@ 000 planned improvement to enhance the trail with stone dust resulted in objections and concerns by locals . Objections were raised on the belief the project would increase motorbike traffic in the park which could pose a hazard to hikers and <unk> . Riding motorbikes in the state park is illegal , but it was also noted that staff was unable to effectively to catch the bikers and had limited means to deter them . The concern of motorcycle collisions were not without merit as a fatal motorcycle @-@ to @-@ motorcycle crash occurred in September 1980 . The idea for trail barriers was rejected because the trail also needed to be able accommodate serve emergency vehicles which were already unable to access the trail effectively . 
 In 2002 , 57 acres were purchased for a total of $ 913 @,@ 300 and added to the park . The first plot of land of the purchase was 49 @.@ 95 acres from <unk> Trustees ( O & G ) and another 7 @.@ 14 acres from Bowen Briggs . The funds for the purchase were from the State of Connecticut 's Recreation and Natural Heritage Trust Program . In 2001 , the " Racetrack Pond " area was purchased from the Mumford Cove Association , resulting in Haley Farm State Park now totaling 267 acres . The park was directly connected to Bluff Point Coastal Reserve through a pedestrian bridge over railroad tracks , built atop the former Groton and Stonington Street Railway bridge .

 According to Leary , " [ t ] he park is a mosaic of upland and wetland vegetation types . " Algae and intertidal plants can be found on the shore , including salt meadow grass , sedge and sphagnum moss . The swampy areas of Haley Farm State Park have red maple and tulip trees , but the uplands include cherry , hickory and shrubs . The history of the area and region have been revealed through the study of the trees . In 1973 , a white oak on the site was found to be 142 years old , in the upper end of the life expectancy of the species . The first 34 years of its life showed rapid growth , believed to have been a result of the 1815 New England hurricane which cleared out many of the older trees and opened the canopy . The rings show a widening in 1918 in response to the chestnut blight and further growth in response to the 1938 New England hurricane . The mid @-@ to @-@ late 1960s shows little growth and serves as evidence of the near @-@ drought conditions of New England . Haley Farm State Park is a rare habitat that " squeezes a great variety of biological diversity into a very small space .

Hunting and shooting is not allowed in the park as it is close to residences and a high school . The facilities only include pit toilets . 
 = Papal conclave = 
 A papal conclave is a meeting of the College of Cardinals convened to elect a new Bishop of Rome , also known as the Pope . The pope is considered by Roman Catholics to be the apostolic successor of Saint Peter and earthly head of the Roman Catholic Church . The conclave has been the procedure for choosing the pope for almost a thousand years , and is the oldest ongoing method for choosing the leader of an institution . 
 A history of political interference in papal selection and consequently long vacancies between popes , culminating in the interregnum of 1268 – 1271 , prompted Pope Gregory X to decree during the Second Council of Lyons in 1274 that the cardinal electors should be locked in seclusion cum clave ( Latin for " with a key " ) and not permitted to leave until a new Bishop of Rome had been elected . Conclaves are now held in the Sistine Chapel of the Apostolic Palace . 
 Since the Apostolic Age , the Bishop of Rome , like other bishops , was chosen by the consensus of the clergy and laity of the diocese . The body of electors was more precisely defined when , in 1059 , the College of Cardinals was designated the sole body of electors . Since then , other details of the process have developed . In 1970 , Pope Paul VI limited the electors to cardinals under 80 years of age . The current procedures were established by Pope John Paul II in his apostolic constitution Universi Dominici gregis as amended by motu <unk> of Pope Benedict XVI dated 11 June 2007 and 25 February 2013 . A two @-@ thirds supermajority vote is required to elect the new pope , which also requires acceptance from the person elected . 
 = = Historical development = = 
 The procedures relating to the election of the pope have undergone almost two millennia of development . Procedures similar to the present system were introduced in 1274 with the promulgation of Ubi periculum by Gregory X , based on the action of the magistrates of Viterbo during the interregnum of 1268 – 1271 . 
 = = = Electorate = = = 
 As the Christian communities became established they started to elect bishops , chosen by the clergy and laity of the community with the assistance of the bishops of neighbouring dioceses . St. Cyprian says that Pope Cornelius was chosen Bishop of Rome " by the decree of God and of His Church , by the testimony of nearly all the clergy , by the college of aged bishops [ <unk> ] , and of good men . " As was true for bishops of other dioceses , the clergy of the Diocese of Rome was the electoral body for the Bishop of Rome . Instead of casting votes , the bishop was selected by general consensus or by acclamation . The candidate would then be submitted to the people for their general approval or disapproval . This lack of precision in the election procedures occasionally gave rise to rival popes or antipopes . 
 The right of the laity to refuse the person elected was abolished by a Synod held in the Lateran in 769 , but restored to Roman noblemen by Pope Nicholas I during a Synod of Rome in 862 . The pope was also subjected to oaths of loyalty to the Holy Roman Emperor , whose task it was to provide security and public peace in Rome . A major change was introduced in 1059 , when Pope Nicholas II decreed in In Nomine Domini that the cardinals were to elect a candidate , who would take office after receiving the assent of the clergy and laity . The cardinal bishops were to meet first and discuss the candidates before summoning the cardinal priests and cardinal deacons for the actual vote . The Second Council of the Lateran in 1139 removed the requirement that the assent of the lower clergy and the laity be obtained , while the Third Council of the Lateran in 1179 gave equal rights to the entire College of Cardinals when electing a new pope . 
 Through much of the Middle Ages and Renaissance there were a small number of cardinals , down to as few as seven under either Pope Alexander IV or Pope John XXI . Difficult travel further reduced the number arriving at the conclave . With a small electorate an individual vote was significant , and was not easily shaken from familial or political lines . Conclaves could last months and even years . In addition to the decree in 1274 that the electors should be locked in seclusion , Gregory X also limited each cardinal elector to two servants , and rationed their food progressively on the fourth and ninth days should they fail to elect a new pope . The strict rules of the conclave were disliked by the cardinals and temporarily suspended by Pope Adrian V in 1276 before being formally revoked by John XXI 's Licet <unk> <unk> later that same year , both of whom had intended to promulgate new constitution governing papal election but died before doing so . Lengthy elections resumed and continued to be the norm until 1294 , when a Benedictine hermit was elected Pope Celestine V. Celestine reinstated the strict conclave , but soon resigned the papacy . Long <unk> occurred after the reinstatement of the conclave : in 1314 – 1316 during the Avignon Papacy , where the original conclave were dispersed by besieging mercenaries and not reconvened until almost two years had passed ; and in 1415 – 1417 , as a result of the Western Schism . 
 In 1587 , Pope Sixtus V limited the maximum number of cardinals to 70 , following the precedent of Moses who was assisted by 70 elders in governing the Children of Israel : six cardinal bishops , 50 cardinal priests , and 14 cardinal deacons . Beginning with Pope John XXIII 's attempts to broaden the representation of nations in the College of Cardinals , that number has increased . In 1970 , Paul VI decreed that cardinals upon reaching the age of eighty before a conclave start were ineligible to vote in the conclave , and also increased the limit of active cardinal electors to 120 . Though this remains the theoretical limit , John Paul II exceeded this for short periods of time with knowledge of impending retirements . John Paul II also specified that cardinals who are under eighty before the day the Holy See becomes vacant would still be entitled to vote even if they had turned eighty by the time the conclave starts . 
 = = = Choice of electors = = = 
 Originally , lay status did not bar election to the Bishop of Rome . Bishops of dioceses were sometimes elected while still catechumens , such as the case of St. Ambrose . In the wake of the violent dispute over the election of Antipope Constantine II , Pope Stephen III held the synod of 769 which decreed that only a cardinal priest or cardinal deacon could be elected specifically excluding those that are already bishops . This was however deviated from as early as 817 and fully ignored from 882 with the election of Pope Marinus I , the Bishop of Caere . Nicholas II , in the synod of 1059 , formally codified existing practice by decreeing that preference was to be given to the clergy of Rome , but leaving the cardinal bishops free to select a cleric from elsewhere if they so decided . These restrictions on eligibility were rescinded by the Council of 1179 . 
 Pope Urban VI in 1378 was the last pope elected from outside the College of Cardinals . The last person elected as pope who was not already an ordained priest or deacon was Pope Leo X in 1513 . His successor , Pope Adrian VI , was the last to be elected in absentia . In more recent history it is reported that Archbishop Giovanni Montini of Milan received several votes in the 1958 conclave despite not being a cardinal . The newly elected John XXIII elevated Montini to the cardinalate almost immediately , and would be succeeded by him as Paul VI in 1963 . As the Catholic Church holds that women cannot be validly ordained , women are not eligible for the papacy . Claims that there was a female pope , including the legendary Pope Joan , are fictitious . This tale began as a satire on the deplorable state of corruption in the College of Cardinals ; things were so bad , even a woman could be elected Pope . Though the pope is the Bishop of Rome , he need not be of Italian background . The current pope , Francis , is an Argentinian while his predecessor , Benedict XVI , is a German and before him was John Paul II , a Pole . 
 A simple majority vote sufficed for election until 1179 , when the Third Council of the Lateran increased the required majority to two @-@ thirds . As cardinals were not allowed to vote for themselves ( after 1621 ) , an elaborate procedure was adopted to ensure secrecy while at the same time preventing self voting . In 1945 , Pope Pius XII removed the prohibition on a cardinal voting for himself by increasing the requisite majority to two @-@ thirds plus one at all times . This change was immediately overturned by his successor John XXIII who reinstated the two @-@ thirds majority if the number of cardinal electors voting is divisible by three , with a rounding up to two @-@ thirds plus one otherwise . Pius XII 's rule was reinstated by Paul VI thirteen years later , but overturned again by John Paul II . In 1996 , John Paul II 's constitution allowed election by absolute majority if deadlock prevailed after thirty three or thirty four ballots . In 2007 Benedict XVI rescinded John Paul II 's change , which had been criticised as effectively abolishing the two @-@ thirds majority requirement , as any majority would suffice to block the election until a simple majority was enough to elect the next pope , reaffirming the requirement of a two @-@ thirds majority . 
 Electors formerly made choices by <unk> , acclamation ( per <unk> ) , adoration , compromise ( per <unk> ) or scrutiny ( per <unk> ) . With acclamation , the cardinals would unanimously declare the new pope quasi <unk> Spiritu Sancto ( as if inspired by the Holy Spirit ) . If this took place before any formal ballot has taken place , the method was called adoration , but this method was excluded in 1621 by Pope Gregory XV . To elect by compromise , a deadlocked College would unanimously delegate the election to a committee of cardinals whose choice they all agree to abide by . Scrutiny is election via the casting of secret ballots . <unk> was a method for cardinals to change their most recent vote to accede to another candidate in an attempt to reach the requisite two @-@ thirds majority and end the conclave . This method was first disallowed by the Cardinal Dean at the 1903 conclave . The last election by compromise is considered to be that of Pope John XXII in 1316 , and the last election by acclamation that of Pope Innocent XI in the 1676 conclave . The long unused methods of acclamation and compromise were formally abolished in Universi Dominici gregis . Scrutiny is now the only approved method for the election of a new pope . 
 = = = Secular influence = = = 
 For a significant part of its history , the Church was influenced in the choice of its leaders by powerful monarchs and governments . For example , the Roman emperors once held considerable sway in the elections of popes . In 418 , Honorius settled a controversial election , upholding Pope Boniface I over the challenger Antipope <unk> . On the request of Boniface I , Honorius ordered that in future cases , any disputed election would be settled by a fresh election . After the demise of the Western Roman Empire , influence passed to the Ostrogothic Kings of Italy and in 533 , Pope John II formally recognised the right of the Ostrogothic monarchs to ratify elections . By 537 , the Ostrogothic monarchy had been overthrown , and power passed to the Byzantine emperors . A procedure was adopted whereby officials were required to notify the Exarch of Ravenna upon the death of a pope before proceeding with the election . Once the electors arrived at a choice , they were required to send a delegation to Constantinople requesting the emperor 's consent , which was necessary before the individual elected could take office . Lengthy delays were caused by the journey to and from Constantinople . When Pope Benedict II complained about them , Emperor Constantine IV acquiesced , ending the requirement that elections be confirmed by emperors . Thereafter , the Emperor was only required to be notified . The last pope to notify the Byzantine emperors was Pope Zachary in 741 . 
 In the 9th century , the Holy Roman Empire came to exert control over the elections of popes . While Charlemagne and Louis the Pious did not interfere with the Church , Lothair I claimed that an election could only be conducted in the presence of imperial ambassadors . In 898 , riots forced Pope John IX to recognise the superintendence of the Holy Roman Emperor . At the same time , the Roman nobility also continued to exert a great influence , especially during the tenth century period known as <unk> <unk> ( Latin for " the dark age " ) . 
 In 1059 , the same papal bull that restricted suffrage to the cardinals also recognised the authority of the Holy Roman Emperor , at the time Henry IV , but only as a concession made by the pope , declaring that the Holy Roman Emperor had no authority to intervene in elections except where permitted to do so by papal agreements . Pope Gregory VII was the last to submit to the interference of the Holy Roman Emperors . The breach between him and the Holy Roman Empire caused by the Investiture Controversy led to the abolition of the Emperor 's role . In 1122 , the Holy Roman Empire acceded to the Concordat of Worms , accepting the papal decision . 
 From about 1600 , certain Catholic monarchs claimed a jus <unk> ( right of exclusion ) , i.e. a veto over papal elections , exercised through a crown @-@ cardinal . By an informal convention , each state claiming the veto was allowed to exercise the right once per conclave . Therefore , a crown @-@ cardinal did not announce the veto until the very last moment when the candidate in question seemed likely to get elected . This was however not strictly enforced , as Francis II through František de Paula <unk> z <unk> is known to have exercised the veto twice at the 1799 – 1800 conclave . No vetoes could be employed after an election . After the Holy Roman Empire was dissolved in 1806 , its veto power devolved upon the Austrian Empire . The last exercise of the veto was in 1903 , when Prince Jan <unk> de <unk> informed the College of Cardinals that Austria opposed the election of Mariano <unk> . Consequently , the College elected Giuseppe Sarto as Pope Pius X , who issued the papal bull <unk> nobis six months later declaring that any cardinal who communicated his government 's veto in the future would suffer excommunication latae sententiae . 
 = = = Conclaves = = = 
 To resolve prolonged deadlocks in the earlier years of papal elections , local authorities often resorted to the forced seclusion of the cardinal electors , such as that first adopted by the city of Rome in 1241 , and possibly before that by Perugia in 1216 . In 1269 , when the forced seclusion of the cardinals alone failed to produce a pope , the city of Viterbo refused to send in any materials except bread and water . When even this failed to produce a result , the townspeople removed the roof of the Palazzo dei Papi in their attempt to speed up the election . 
 In an attempt to avoid future lengthy elections , Gregory X introduced stringent rules with the promulgation of Ubi periculum . Cardinals were to be secluded in a closed area and not accorded individual rooms . No cardinal was allowed , unless ill , to be attended by more than two servants . Food was supplied through a window to avoid outside contact . After three days of the conclave , the cardinals were to receive only one dish a day ; after another five days , they were to receive just bread and water . During the conclave , no cardinal was to receive any ecclesiastical revenue . 
 Gregory X 's strict regulations were abolished in 1276 by Adrian V , but Celestine V , elected in 1294 following a two @-@ year vacancy , restored them . In 1562 , Pius IV issued a papal bull that introduced regulations relating to the enclosure of the conclave and other procedures . Gregory XV issued two bulls that covered the most minute of details relating to the election ; the first , in 1621 , concerned electoral processes , while the other , in 1622 , fixed the ceremonies to be observed . In 1904 , Pope Pius X issued a constitution consolidating almost all the previous rules , making some changes . Several reforms were also instituted by John Paul II in 1996 . 
 The location of the conclaves was not fixed until the fourteenth century . Since the Western Schism , however , elections have always been held in Rome ( except in 1800 , when French troops occupying Rome forced the election to be held in Venice ) , and normally in what , since the Lateran Treaties of 1929 , has become the independent Vatican City State . Since 1846 , when the Quirinal Palace was used , the Sistine Chapel in the Vatican has always served as the location of the election . Popes have often fine @-@ tuned the rules for the election of their successors : Pope Pius XII 's <unk> <unk> Sedis of 1945 governed the conclave of 1958 , Pope John XXIII 's Summi <unk> <unk> of 1962 that of 1963 , Pope Paul VI 's Romano <unk> <unk> of 1975 those of 1978 , and John Paul II 's Universi Dominici <unk> of 1996 that of 2005 . Benedict XVI 's De <unk> <unk> of 2007 governed that of 2013 . 
 = = Modern practice = = 
 In 1996 , John Paul II promulgated a new Apostolic Constitution , called Universi Dominici gregis , which with a slight modification by Pope Benedict XVI now governs the election of the pope , abolishing all previous constitutions on the matter , but preserving many procedures that date to much earlier times . 
 Under Universi Dominici gregis , the cardinals are to be lodged in a purpose @-@ built edifice , the Domus Sanctae <unk> , but are to continue to vote in the Sistine Chapel . 
 Several duties are performed by the Dean of the College of Cardinals , who is always a Cardinal Bishop . If the Dean is not entitled to participate in the conclave owing to age , his place is taken by the Sub @-@ Dean , who is also always a Cardinal Bishop . If the Sub @-@ Dean also cannot participate , the senior Cardinal Bishop participating performs the functions . 
 Since the College of Cardinals is a small body , there have been proposals that the electorate should be expanded . Proposed reforms include a plan to replace the College of Cardinals as the electoral body with the Synod of Bishops , which includes many more members . Under present procedure , however , the Synod may only meet when called by the pope . Universi Dominici gregis explicitly provides that even if a synod or an ecumenical council is in session at the time of a pope 's death , it may not perform the election . Upon the pope 's death , either body 's proceedings are suspended , to be resumed only upon the order of the new pope . 
 It is considered poor form to campaign for the position of pope . However , there is inevitably always much speculation about which cardinals have serious prospects of being elected . Speculation tends to mount when a pope is ill or aged and <unk> of potential candidates appear in the media . A cardinal who is considered to be a prospect for the papacy is described informally as a papabile ( an adjective used substantively : the plural form is <unk> ) , a term coined by Italian @-@ speaking Vatican watchers in the mid @-@ twentieth century , literally meaning " pope @-@ able " . 
 = = = Death of the pope = = = 
 The death of the pope is verified by the Cardinal Camerlengo , or Chamberlain , who traditionally performed the task by gently striking the pope 's head with a small silver hammer and calling out his Christian ( not papal ) name three times . During the 20th century the use of the hammer in this ritual has been abandoned ; under Universi Dominici gregis , the Camerlengo must merely declare the pope 's death in the presence of the Master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations , and of the Cleric Prelates , Secretary and Chancellor of the Apostolic Camera . The Cardinal Camerlengo takes possession of the Ring of the Fisherman worn by the pope ; the ring , along with the papal seal , is later destroyed before the College of Cardinals . The tradition originated to avoid forgery of documents , but today merely is a symbol of the end of the pope 's reign . 
 During the sede vacante , as the papal vacancy is known , certain limited powers pass to the College of Cardinals , which is convoked by the Dean of the College of Cardinals . All cardinals are obliged to attend the General Congregation of Cardinals , except those whose health does not permit , or who are over eighty ( but those cardinals may choose to attend if they please ) . The Particular Congregation , which deals with the day @-@ to @-@ day matters of the Church , includes the Cardinal Camerlengo and the three Cardinal Assistants — one Cardinal @-@ Bishop , one Cardinal @-@ Priest and one Cardinal @-@ Deacon — chosen by lot . Every three days , new Cardinal Assistants are chosen by lot . The Cardinal Camerlengo and Cardinal Assistants are responsible , among other things , for maintaining the election 's secrecy . 
 The Congregations must make certain arrangements in respect of the pope 's burial , which by tradition takes place within four to six days of the pope 's death , leaving time for pilgrims to see the dead pontiff , and is to be followed by a nine @-@ day period of mourning ( this is known as the <unk> , Latin for " nine days " ) . The Congregations also fix the date and time of the commencement of the conclave . The conclave normally takes place fifteen days after the death of the pope , but the Congregations may extend the period to a maximum of twenty days in order to permit other cardinals to arrive in the Vatican City . 
 = = = Resignation of a pope = = = 
 A vacancy in the papal office may also result from a papal resignation . Until the resignation of Benedict XVI on 28 February 2013 , no pope had abdicated since Gregory XII in 1415 . In his book The Light of the World Benedict XVI had espoused the idea of abdication on health grounds which already had some theological respectability . 
 = = = Before the sealing of the Sistine Chapel = = = 
 The cardinals hear two sermons before the election : one before actually entering the conclave , and one once they are settled in the Sistine Chapel . In both cases , the sermons are meant to lay out the current state of the Church , and to suggest the qualities necessary for a pope to possess in that specific time . The first preacher in the 2005 conclave was Fr . <unk> <unk> , the preacher of the papal household and a member of the Capuchin Franciscan order , who spoke at one of the meetings of the cardinals held before the actual day when the conclave began . Cardinal Tomáš <unk> , a former professor at the Pontifical Oriental Institute and a non @-@ voting member ( due to age ) of the College of Cardinals , spoke just before the doors were finally closed for the conclave . 
 On the morning of the day designated by the Congregations of Cardinals , the cardinal electors assemble in St Peter 's Basilica to celebrate the Eucharist . Then , they gather in the afternoon in the Pauline Chapel of the Palace of the Vatican , <unk> to the Sistine Chapel whilst invoking the Litany of the Saints by congregational singing . The Cardinals will also sing as a congregation the Veni Creator then take an oath to observe the procedures set down by the apostolic constitutions ; to , if elected , defend the liberty of the Holy See ; to maintain secrecy ; and to disregard the instructions of secular authorities on voting . The Cardinal Dean reads the oath aloud in full ; in order of precedence ( where their rank is the same , their birthdate is taken as precedence ) , the other cardinal electors repeat the oath , while touching the Gospels . The oath is as follows : 
 Et ego , ( first name ) , Cardinalis ( surname ) , <unk> , <unk> , ac <unk> . Sic me Deus <unk> et haec Sancta Dei <unk> , quae manu mea tango . 
 ( And I , ( name ) Cardinal , ( name ) , promise , vow and swear . Thus , may God help me and these Holy Gospels which I touch with my hand . ) 
 = = = <unk> the outsiders = = = 
 After all the cardinals present have taken the oath , the Master of the Papal Liturgical Celebrations orders all individuals other than the cardinal electors and conclave participants to leave the Chapel . Traditionally , he stands at the door of the Sistine Chapel and calls out : " Extra omnes ! " ( Latin for , roughly , " Everybody else , get out ! " ) He then closes the door . In modern practice , the Master of the Papal Liturgical Celebrations does not have to stand at the door of the Sistine Chapel — during the 2013 conclave , the Master Guido Marini stood in front of the altar and gave the command and only went to the chapel doors to close them after the outsiders had left . 
 The Master himself may remain , as may one ecclesiastic designated by the Congregations prior to the commencement of the election . The ecclesiastic makes a speech concerning the problems facing the Church and on the qualities the new pope needs to have . After the speech concludes , the ecclesiastic leaves . Following the recitation of prayers , the Cardinal Dean asks if any doubts relating to procedure remain . After the clarification of the doubts , the election may commence . Cardinals who arrive after the conclave has begun are admitted nevertheless . An ill cardinal may leave the conclave and later be readmitted ; a cardinal who leaves for any reason other than illness may not return to the conclave . 
 Although in the past cardinal electors could be accompanied by attendants ( " <unk> " ) , now only a nurse may accompany a cardinal who for reasons of ill @-@ health , as confirmed by the Congregation of Cardinals , needs such assistance . The Secretary of the College of Cardinals , the Master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations , two Masters of Ceremonies , two officers of the Papal Sacristy and an ecclesiastic assisting the Dean of the College of Cardinals are also admitted to the conclave . Priests are available to hear confessions in different languages ; two doctors are also admitted . Finally , a strictly limited number of servant staff are permitted for housekeeping and the preparing and serving of meals . 
 Secrecy is maintained during the conclave ; the cardinals as well as the <unk> and staff are forbidden to disclose any information relating to the election . Cardinal electors may not correspond or converse with anyone outside the conclave , by post , radio , telephone , internet and social media , or otherwise and eavesdropping is an offense punishable by excommunication latae sententiae . Only three cardinals electors are permitted to communicate with the outside world under grave circumstances , prior to approval of the College , to fulfil their duties : the Major Penitentiary , the Cardinal Vicar for the Diocese of Rome , and the Vicar General for the Vatican City State . 
 Before the conclave that elected Pope Francis , the Sistine Chapel was " swept " using the latest electronic devices to detect any hidden " bugs " or surveillance devices ( there were no reports that any were found , but in previous conclaves press reporters who had disguised themselves as conclave servants were discovered ) . Universi Dominici gregis specifically prohibits media such as newspapers , the radio , and television . Wi @-@ Fi access is blocked in Vatican City and wireless signal jammers are deployed at the Sistine Chapel to prevent any form of electronic communications to or from the Cardinal electors . 
 = = = Voting = = = 
 On the afternoon of the first day , one ballot may be held . If a ballot takes place on the afternoon of the first day and no @-@ one is elected , or no ballot had taken place , four ballots are held on each successive day : two in each morning and two in each afternoon . Before voting in the morning and again before voting in the afternoon , the electors take an oath to obey the rules of the conclave . If no result is obtained after three vote days of balloting , the process is suspended for a maximum of one day for prayer and an address by the senior Cardinal Deacon . After seven further ballots , the process may again be similarly suspended , with the address now being delivered by the senior Cardinal Priest . If , after another seven ballots , no result is achieved , voting is suspended once more , the address being delivered by the senior Cardinal Bishop . After a further seven ballots , there shall be a day of prayer , reflection and dialogue . In the following ballots , only the two names who received the most votes in the last ballot shall be eligible in a runoff election . However , the two people who are being voted on , if Cardinal electors , shall not themselves have the right to vote . 
 The process of voting comprises three phases : the " pre @-@ scrutiny " , the " scrutiny " , and the " post @-@ scrutiny . " 
 = = = = Pre @-@ scrutiny = = = = 
 During the pre @-@ scrutiny , the Masters of the Ceremonies prepare ballot papers bearing the words <unk> in Summum <unk> ( " I elect as Supreme Pontiff " ) and provide at least two to each cardinal elector . As the cardinals begin to write down their votes , the Secretary of the College of Cardinals , the Master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations and the Masters of Ceremonies exit ; the junior Cardinal Deacon then closes the door . The junior Cardinal Deacon then draws by lot nine names ; the first three become Scrutineers , the second three Infirmarii and the last three Revisers . New Scrutineers , Infirmarii and Revisers are not selected again after the first scrutiny ; the same nine cardinals perform the same task for the second scrutiny . After lunch , the election resumes with the oath to obey the rules of the conclave taken anew when the cardinals again assemble in the Sistine Chapel . Nine names are chosen for new scrutineers , <unk> , and <unk> . The third scrutiny then commences , and if necessary , a fourth immediately follows . No changes in these rules were made by Benedict XVI in 2007 . These rules were followed , so far as is known , given the secrecy of a conclave , in electing Pope Francis in March 2013 . 
 = = = = Scrutiny = = = = 
 The scrutiny phase of the election is as follows : The cardinal electors proceed , in order of precedence , to take their completed ballots ( which bear only the name of the individual voted for ) to the altar , where the Scrutineers stand . Before casting the ballot , each cardinal elector takes a Latin oath , which translates to : " I call as my witness Christ the Lord who will be my judge , that my vote is given to the one who before God I think should be elected . " If any cardinal elector is in the Chapel , but cannot proceed to the altar due to infirmity , the last Scrutineer may go to him and take his ballot after the oath is recited . If any cardinal elector is by reason of infirmity confined to his room , the Infirmarii go to their rooms with ballot papers and a box . Any such sick cardinals take the oath and then complete the ballot papers . When the Infirmarii return to the Chapel , the ballots are counted to ensure that their number matches with the number of ill cardinals ; thereafter , they are deposited in the appropriate receptacle . This oath is taken by all cardinals as they cast their ballots . If no one is chosen on the first scrutiny , then a second scrutiny immediately follows . A total of four <unk> are taken each day , two in the morning and two in the afternoon . 
 The oath when casting one 's vote is therefore anonymous , since the name of the elector is no longer signed on the ballot with that of the candidate . ( Previously , the ballot was signed by the elector , who included his motiff [ unique identification code ] . Then he folded it over at two places to cover his signature and motiff . After this , it was sealed with wax to result in a semi @-@ secret ballot . See example above . ) This was the procedure prior to 1945 . The example above is a copy of the old three section semi @-@ secret ballot , which was last used in the conclave of 1939 . There was no oath taken when actually casting ballots , prior to 1621 . Completely secret ballots ( at the option of the cardinals present and voting ) were sometimes used prior to 1621 , but these secret ballots had no oath taken when the vote was actually cast . At some conclaves prior to 1621 , the cardinals verbally voted and sometimes stood in groups to facilitate counting the votes cast . The signature and motiff of the elector covered by two folded @-@ over parts of the ballot paper was added by Gregory XV in 1621 , to prevent anyone from casting the deciding vote for himself . Cardinal Pole of England refused to cast the deciding vote for himself in 1549 ( and was not elected ) , but in 1492 Cardinal Borgia ( Pope Alexander VI ) did cast the deciding vote for himself . Faced by the mortal challenge to the papacy emanating from Protestantism , and fearing schism due to several stormy conclaves in the late 16th and early 17th centuries , Gregory XV established this procedure to prevent any cardinal from casting the deciding vote for himself . Since 1945 , a cardinal can again cast the deciding vote for himself , though the ⅔ majority rule has always been continued , except when John Paul II had modified that rule in 1996 ( after 33 ballots , a simple majority was sufficient ) , with the ⅔ majority rule restored in 2007 by Benedict XVI . 
 Prior to 1621 , the only oath taken was that of obedience to the rules of the conclave in force at that time , when the cardinals entered the conclave and the doors were locked , and each morning and afternoon as they entered the Sistine Chapel to vote . Gregory XV added the additional oath , taken when each cardinal casts his ballot , to prevent cardinals wasting time in casting " courtesy votes " and instead narrowing the number of realistic candidates for the papal throne to perhaps only two or three . Speed in electing a pope was important , and that meant using an oath so as to get the cardinals down to the serious business of electing a new pope and narrowing the number of potentially electable candidates . The reforms of Gregory XV in 1621 and reaffirmed in 1622 created the written detailed step @-@ by @-@ step procedure used in choosing a pope ; a procedure that was essentially the same as that which was used in 2013 to elect Pope Francis . The biggest change since 1621 was the elimination of the rule that required the electors to sign their ballots resulting in the detailed voting procedure of scrutiny making use of anonymous oaths . This was perhaps the most significant change in the modern era . It was a significant change to the step @-@ by @-@ step voting procedure , since that detailed voting procedure was first created in 1621 . It was Pius XII who made this change in 1945 . 
 Once all votes have been cast , the first Scrutineer chosen shakes the container , and the last Scrutineer removes and counts the ballots . If the number of ballots does not correspond to the number of cardinal electors present ( including sick cardinals in their rooms ) , the ballots are burnt , unread , and the vote is repeated . If , however , no irregularities are observed , the ballots may be opened and the votes counted . Each ballot is unfolded by the first Scrutineer ; all three Scrutineers separately write down the name indicated on the ballot . The last of the Scrutineers reads the name aloud . 
 Once all of the ballots have been opened , the final post @-@ scrutiny phase begins . 
 = = = = Post @-@ scrutiny = = = = 
 The Scrutineers add up all of the votes , and the Revisers check the ballots and the names on the Scrutineers ' lists to ensure that no error was made . The ballots are then all burned by the Scrutineers with the assistance of the Secretary of the College and the Masters of Ceremonies . If the first scrutiny held in any given morning or afternoon does not result in an election , the cardinals proceed to the next scrutiny immediately . The papers from both <unk> are then burned together at the end of the second scrutiny . 
 = = = = = Smoke colors = = = = = 
 The color of the smoke indicates the results to the people assembled in St Peter 's Square . Dark smoke ( <unk> <unk> ) indicates that the ballot did not result in an election , while white smoke ( <unk> bianca ) announces that a new pope was chosen . Originally , in the event a pope was not elected , damp straw was added to the fire to create dark smoke . In the event a new pope was elected , the ballots were burned alone , creating white smoke . 
 Prior to 1945 ( when Pius XII changed the form of ballot to use anonymous oaths , first carried out in 1958 ) , the sealing wax on the complex type ballots illustrated above had the effect of making the smoke from burning the ballots either black or white , depending on whether or not damp straw was added . Until the 20th century , sealing wax customarily had beeswax mixed into its composition . The use of wax made solely from animal fat does not give as much white colored smoke , as does wax that includes beeswax . A simple experiment will confirm this . In the 1939 conclave there was some confusion over the smoke color , which was even more apparent in the 1958 conclave . This explains the confusion over the color of the smoke in the 1958 Papal conclave , caused by the lack of sealing wax on the ballots . The Siri Thesis was based on the confusion over the smoke color on the first day of that conclave . 
 Since 1963 , chemicals have been added to the burning process , and beginning in 2005 , bells ring after a successful election to augment the white smoke . 
 During the 2013 conclave , the Vatican disclosed the chemicals used to color the smoke : 
 Black smoke : Potassium perchlorate , <unk> , Sulphur 
 White smoke : Potassium chlorate , Lactose / milk sugar , <unk> / pine rosin 
 = = = Acceptance and proclamation = = = 
 Once the election concludes , the Cardinal Dean summons the Secretary of the College of Cardinals and the Master of Papal Liturgical Celebrations into the hall . The Cardinal Dean then asks the pope @-@ elect if he assents to the election , saying in Latin : " <unk> <unk> de te <unk> <unk> in Summum <unk> ? ( Do you accept your canonical election as Supreme Pontiff ? ) " There is no requirement that the pope @-@ elect do so and he is free to respond " Non <unk> " ( I don 't accept ) . 
 In practice , any cardinal who intends not to accept will explicitly state this before he receives a sufficient number of votes to become pope , as Giovanni Colombo did in October 1978 . 
 If he accepts , and is already a bishop , he immediately takes office . If he is not a bishop , however , he must be first consecrated as one before he can assume office . If a priest is elected , the Cardinal Dean consecrates him bishop ; if a layman is elected , then the Cardinal Dean first ordains him deacon , then priest , and only then consecrates him as bishop . Only after becoming a bishop does the pope @-@ elect take office . These functions of the Dean are assumed , if necessary , by the sub @-@ Dean , and if the sub @-@ Dean is also impeded , they are assumed by the senior cardinal @-@ bishop in attendance . In 2005 the Dean himself — Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger — was elected pope . In 2013 , the Dean and sub @-@ Dean were not in attendance ( over the age limit ) , and these functions were assumed by Cardinal Giovanni Battista Re . 
 Since 533 , the new pope has also decided on his regnal name . Pope John II was the first to adopt a new papal name ; he felt that his original name , Mercurius , was inappropriate , as it was also the name of a Roman god . In most cases , even if such considerations are absent , popes tend to choose papal names different from their baptismal names ; the last pope to reign under his baptismal name was Pope Marcellus II ( 1555 ) . After the newly elected pope accepts his election , the Cardinal Dean asks him about his papal name , saying in Latin : " Quo nomine vis <unk> ? ( By what name do you wish to be called ? ) " After the papal name is chosen , the officials are readmitted to the conclave , and the Master of Pontifical Liturgical Ceremonies writes a document recording the acceptance and the new name of the pope . 
 In the past , when the cardinals were voting during the conclave , they sat on canopied thrones symbolizing the cardinals ' collective governance of the church during the period of sede vacante . Upon the acceptance by the new pope of his election , all other cardinals in attendance would each pull a cord and lower the canopies above their respective thrones signifying an end to the period of collective governance and only the newly elected pope 's canopy remained <unk> . The last time canopied thrones were used was during the 1963 conclave . Beginning with the 1978 August conclave canopied thrones were no longer used due to the lack of space resulting from the large increase in the number of cardinal electors . 
 At the end of the conclave , the new pope if he so chose , would give his cardinalitial zucchetto or skull cap to the secretary of the conclave , indicating the secretary would be made cardinal at the next consistory to create cardinals . Prior to the 2013 conclave , this tradition was last followed at the 1958 conclave by the newly elected Pope John XXIII , who bestowed his cardinal 's skull cap on Alberto di Jorio and created him a cardinal at the consistory on December 15 of that year . In 2013 the Portuguese section of Vatican Radio reported that at the conclusion of the 2013 conclave , the newly elected Pope Francis bestowed his cardinalitial zucchetto on Archbishop Lorenzo <unk> the secretary of that conclave and on February 22 , 2014 at Pope Francis ' first consistory , <unk> was formally made a cardinal with the title of Cardinal @-@ Deacon of Sant ’ Anselmo all ’ <unk> . 
 Then , the new pope goes to the " Room of Tears " , a small red room next to the Sistine Chapel ; the room has the nickname because of the strong emotions experienced by the new pope . The new pope dresses by himself , choosing a set of pontifical choir robes — consisting of a white cassock , rochet , and red mozzetta — from three sizes provided . He then wears a gold corded pectoral cross , a red and gold embroidered stole , and then dons the white papal zucchetto on his head . In 2013 , Pope Francis dispensed with the red mozzetta , rochet , and gold pectoral cross , wearing only the white cassock and his own pectoral cross when he appeared on the central balcony . He also did not emerge wearing the stole , vesting in it only to impart the Apostolic Blessing and removing it shortly after . 
 Next , the Cardinal Protodeacon ( the senior Cardinal Deacon ) appears at the loggia of the Basilica to proclaim the new pope . He usually proceeds with the traditional Latin formula ( assuming the new Pope was a cardinal ) : 
 During the announcement for Pope Benedict XVI 's election , the cardinal protodeacon Jorge Arturo Medina <unk> greeted the crowds first in several different languages " Dear brothers and sisters " before proceeding to the Latin announcement . This was not done when Pope Francis was elected . 
 It has happened in the past that the Cardinal Protodeacon has himself been the person elected pope . In such an event , the announcement is made by the next senior Deacon , who has thus succeeded as Protodeacon . The last time the cardinal protodeacon was elected was in 1513 when Giovanni de Medici was elected as Pope Leo X and the next senior cardinal deacon Alessandro Farnese ( the future Pope Paul III ) made the announcement . During the election of Pope Leo XIII in 1878 Protodeacon Prospero <unk> appeared and started to make the announcement but was physically incapable of completing it , so another made it for him . 
 Following the announcement , the senior Cardinal Deacon retreats , and papal aides unfurl a large , maroon banner that out of practicality often bears the late pope 's arms in the centre , draping it onto the railing of the Basilica 's loggia . During Pope Francis ' announcement , there was no image of his predecessor 's arms ( indicating that the previous pope was still alive ) , and during Pope Pius XI 's first appearance following his election at the 1922 conclave , the banner showed the arms of Pope Pius IX instead of the arms of his immediate predecessor Pope Benedict XV . The new pope then emerges onto the balcony to the adulation of the crowd , while a brass band in the forecourt below plays the Pontifical Anthem . He then imparts the Urbi et Orbi blessing . The Pope may on this occasion choose to give the shorter episcopal blessing as his first Apostolic Blessing instead of the traditional Urbi et Orbi blessing , this happened most recently with Pope Paul VI after his election at the 1963 conclave Beginning with Pope John Paul II , the last three popes elected including Pope Francis , have chosen to address the crowds first before imparting the Urbi et Orbi blessing . Also , at Pope Francis ' first appearance , he led the faithful first in prayers for his predecessor and asked them for prayers for himself before imparting the Urbi et Orbi blessing . 
 Formerly , the pope would later be crowned by the <unk> or Triple Tiara at the Papal Coronation . All popes since John Paul I have refused an elaborate coronation , choosing instead to have a simpler papal inauguration ceremony . 
 = = Historical voting patterns = = 
 The newly elected pope often contrasts dramatically with his predecessor , a tendency expressed by the Italian saying " After a fat pope , a lean pope " . Past cardinals have often voted for someone radically different from the pope who appointed them . The controversial one @-@ time populist @-@ turned @-@ conservative , long @-@ lived Pope Pius IX ( 1846 – 1878 ) was succeeded by the aristocratic and diplomatic Pope Leo XIII ( 1878 – 1903 ) . He in turn was succeeded by the lower @-@ class , bluntly outspoken Pope Pius X ( 1903 – 1914 ) . Pius X 's rugged ultra @-@ conservatism contrasted with the low @-@ key <unk> of Pope Benedict XV ( 1914 – 1922 ) , which again contrasted with the former librarian and mountain climber Pope Pius XI ( 1922 – 1939 ) , who led Roman Catholicism with an authoritarianism more akin to Pius X , who also shared his temperament . 
 Pius XI was succeeded in 1939 by his Secretary of State , the aristocratic ultra @-@ insider <unk> Pope Pius XII ( 1939 – 1958 ) . Pius XII was seen as one of the great thinkers to assume the papacy in the 20th century and was also the ultimate insider ; his grandfather , father , cousin and brother have been Vatican high @-@ ranking officials . Pius was succeeded by the lower @-@ class , elderly , popular , and informal Pope John XXIII ( 1958 – 1963 ) . The contrast between the diffident , intellectual and distant Pius XII and the humble — in his own words " ordinary " — " Good Pope John " was dramatic , with none more surprised at the election than Pope John himself . He reportedly already had his return rail ticket in his pocket when he was elected . 
 John proved to be a radical break with the two previous popes , and indeed with most of the popes of the 20th century . After a short but dramatic pontificate during which he convoked the Second Vatican Council , John XXIII was replaced by the widely expected Giovanni Batista Montini , who many believed would have been elected in 1958 had he been a cardinal then . Pope Paul VI ( 1963 – 1978 ) was a <unk> like Pius XII , whom he had worked with in the curia during the 1930s and 1940s . Paul VI himself was briefly succeeded by non @-@ <unk> Pope John Paul I ( 1978 ) , who in turn was succeeded by Karol Wojtyła as Pope John Paul II ( 1978 – 2005 ) . Wojtyła , the first non @-@ Italian since 1523 , spoke many languages and was originally from the Eastern Bloc , an important consideration given contemporary Cold War politics and the Church 's repression there . After a relatively long reign , he was succeeded in 2005 by the German Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and Cardinal Dean , Joseph Ratzinger , as Pope Benedict XVI . A more reserved and conservative pontiff than his predecessor , he reigned until his resignation in 2013 , when he was succeeded by the simpler and less formal Argentinian Cardinal Archbishop of Buenos Aires Jorge <unk> as Pope Francis .

 = Power dividers and directional couplers = 
 Power dividers ( also power splitters and , when used in reverse , power combiners ) and directional couplers are passive devices used in the field of radio technology . They couple a defined amount of the electromagnetic power in a transmission line to a port enabling the signal to be used in another circuit . An essential feature of directional couplers is that they only couple power flowing in one direction . Power entering the output port is coupled to the isolated port but not to the coupled port . 
 Directional couplers are most frequently constructed from two coupled transmission lines set close enough together such that energy passing through one is coupled to the other . This technique is favoured at the microwave frequencies where transmission line designs are commonly used to implement many circuit elements . However , lumped component devices are also possible at lower frequencies . Also at microwave frequencies , particularly the higher bands , waveguide designs can be used . Many of these waveguide couplers correspond to one of the conducting transmission line designs , but there are also types that are unique to waveguide . 
 Directional couplers and power dividers have many applications , these include ; providing a signal sample for measurement or monitoring , feedback , combining feeds to and from antennae , antenna beam forming , providing taps for cable distributed systems such as cable TV , and separating transmitted and received signals on telephone lines . 
 = = Notation and symbols = = 
 The symbols most often used for directional couplers are shown in figure 1 . The symbol may have the coupling factor in dB marked on it . Directional couplers have four ports . Port 1 is the input port where power is applied . Port 3 is the coupled port where a portion of the power applied to port 1 appears . Port 2 is the transmitted port where the power from port 1 is outputted , less the portion that went to port 3 . Directional couplers are frequently symmetrical so there also exists port 4 , the isolated port . A portion of the power applied to port 2 will be coupled to port 4 . However , the device is not normally used in this mode and port 4 is usually terminated with a matched load ( typically 50 ohms ) . This termination can be internal to the device and port 4 is not accessible to the user . Effectively , this results in a 3 @-@ port device , hence the utility of the second symbol for directional couplers in figure 1 . 
 Symbols of the form ; 
 <formula> 
 in this article have the meaning " parameter P at port a due to an input at port b " . 
 A symbol for power dividers is shown in figure 2 . Power dividers and directional couplers are in all essentials the same class of device . Directional coupler tends to be used for 4 @-@ port devices that are only loosely coupled – that is , only a small fraction of the input power appears at the coupled port . Power divider is used for devices with tight coupling ( commonly , a power divider will provide half the input power at each of its output ports – a 3 dB divider ) and is usually considered a 3 @-@ port device . 
 = = Parameters = = 
 Common properties desired for all directional couplers are wide operational bandwidth , high directivity , and a good impedance match at all ports when the other ports are terminated in matched loads . Some of these , and other , general characteristics are discussed below . 
 = = = Coupling factor = = = 
 The coupling factor is defined as : <formula> 
 where P1 is the input power at port 1 and P3 is the output power from the coupled port ( see figure 1 ) . 
 The coupling factor represents the primary property of a directional coupler . Coupling factor is a negative quantity , it cannot exceed 0 dB for a passive device , and in practice does not exceed − 3 dB since more than this would result in more power output from the coupled port than power from the transmitted port – in effect their roles would be reversed . Although a negative quantity , the minus sign is frequently dropped ( but still implied ) in running text and diagrams and a few authors go so far as to define it as a positive quantity . Coupling is not constant , but varies with frequency . While different designs may reduce the variance , a perfectly flat coupler theoretically cannot be built . Directional couplers are specified in terms of the coupling accuracy at the frequency band center . 
 = = = Loss = = = 
 The main line insertion loss from port 1 to port 2 ( P1 – P2 ) is : 
 Insertion loss : <formula> 
 Part of this loss is due to some power going to the coupled port and is called coupling loss and is given by : 
 Coupling loss : <formula> 
 The insertion loss of an ideal directional coupler will consist entirely of the coupling loss . In a real directional coupler , however , the insertion loss consists of a combination of coupling loss , dielectric loss , conductor loss , and VSWR loss . Depending on the frequency range , coupling loss becomes less significant above 15 dB coupling where the other losses constitute the majority of the total loss . The theoretical insertion loss ( dB ) vs coupling ( dB ) for a <unk> coupler is shown in the graph of figure 3 and the table below . 
 = = = Isolation = = = 
 Isolation of a directional coupler can be defined as the difference in signal levels in dB between the input port and the isolated port when the two other ports are terminated by matched loads , or : 
 Isolation : <formula> 
 Isolation can also be defined between the two output ports . In this case , one of the output ports is used as the input ; the other is considered the output port while the other two ports ( input and isolated ) are terminated by matched loads . 
 Consequently : <formula> 
 The isolation between the input and the isolated ports may be different from the isolation between the two output ports . For example , the isolation between ports 1 and 4 can be 30 dB while the isolation between ports 2 and 3 can be a different value such as 25 dB . Isolation can be estimated from the coupling plus return loss . The isolation should be as high as possible . In actual couplers the isolated port is never completely isolated . Some RF power will always be present . Waveguide directional couplers will have the best isolation . 
 = = = Directivity = = = 
 Directivity is directly related to isolation . It is defined as : 
 Directivity : <formula> 
 where : P3 is the output power from the coupled port and P4 is the power output from the isolated port . 
 The directivity should be as high as possible . The directivity is very high at the design frequency and is a more sensitive function of frequency because it depends on the cancellation of two wave components . Waveguide directional couplers will have the best directivity . Directivity is not directly measurable , and is calculated from the addition of the isolation and ( negative ) coupling measurements as : 
 <formula> 
 Note that if the positive definition of coupling is used , the formula results in : 
 <formula> 
 = = = S @-@ parameters = = = 
 The S @-@ matrix for an ideal ( infinite isolation and perfectly matched ) symmetrical directional coupler is given by , 
 <formula> 
 <formula> is the transmission coefficient and , 
 <formula> is the coupling coefficient 
 In general , <formula> and <formula> are complex , frequency dependent , numbers . The zeroes on the matrix main diagonal are a consequence of perfect matching – power input to any port is not reflected back to that same port . The zeroes on the matrix antidiagonal are a consequence of perfect isolation between the input and isolated port . 
 For a passive lossless directional coupler , we must in addition have , 
 <formula> 
 since the power entering the input port must all leave by one of the other two ports . 
 Insertion loss is related to <formula> by ; 
 <formula> 
 Coupling factor is related to <formula> by ; 
 <formula> 
 Non @-@ zero main diagonal entries are related to return loss , and non @-@ zero antidiagonal entries are related to isolation by similar expressions . 
 Some authors define the port numbers with ports 3 and 4 interchanged . This results in a scattering matrix that is no longer all @-@ zeroes on the antidiagonal . 
 = = = Amplitude balance = = = 
 This terminology defines the power difference in dB between the two output ports of a 3 dB hybrid . In an ideal hybrid circuit , the difference should be 0 dB . However , in a practical device the amplitude balance is frequency dependent and departs from the ideal 0 dB difference . 
 = = = Phase balance = = = 
 The phase difference between the two output ports of a hybrid coupler should be 0 ° , 90 ° , or 180 ° depending on the type used . However , like amplitude balance , the phase difference is sensitive to the input frequency and typically will vary a few degrees .

 = = = Directional couplers = = = 
 = = = = Coupled transmission lines = = = = 
 The most common form of directional coupler is a pair of coupled transmission lines . They can be realised in a number of technologies including coaxial and the planar technologies ( stripline and microstrip ) . An implementation in stripline is shown in figure 4 of a quarter @-@ wavelength ( λ / 4 ) directional coupler . The power on the coupled line flows in the opposite direction to the power on the main line , hence the port arrangement is not the same as shown in figure 1 , but the numbering remains the same . For this reason it is sometimes called a backward coupler . 
 The main line is the section between ports 1 and 2 and the coupled line is the section between ports 3 and 4 . Since the directional coupler is a linear device , the notations on figure 1 are arbitrary . Any port can be the input , ( an example is seen in figure 20 ) which will result in the directly connected port being the transmitted port , the adjacent port being the coupled port , and the diagonal port being the isolated port . On some directional couplers , the main line is designed for high power operation ( large connectors ) , while the coupled port may use a small connector , such as an SMA connector . The internal load power rating may also limit operation on the coupled line . 
 Accuracy of coupling factor depends on the dimensional tolerances for the spacing of the two coupled lines . For planar printed technologies this comes down to the resolution of the printing process which determines the minimum track width that can be produced and also puts a limit on how close the lines can be placed to each other . This becomes a problem when very tight coupling is required and 3 dB couplers often use a different design . However , tightly coupled lines can be produced in air stripline which also permits manufacture by printed planar technology . In this design the two lines are printed on opposite sides of the dielectric rather than side by side . The coupling of the two lines across their width is much greater than the coupling when they are edge @-@ on to each other . 
 The λ / 4 coupled line design is good for coaxial and stripline implementations but does not work so well in the now popular microstrip format , although designs do exist . The reason for this is that microstrip is not a homogeneous medium – there are two different mediums above and below the transmission strip . This leads to transmission modes other than the usual TEM mode found in conductive circuits . The propagation velocities of even and odd modes are different leading to signal dispersion . A better solution for microstrip is a coupled line much shorter than λ / 4 , shown in figure 5 , but this has the disadvantage of a coupling factor which rises noticeably with frequency . A variation of this design sometimes encountered has the coupled line a higher impedance than the main line such as shown in figure 6 . This design is advantageous where the coupler is being fed to a detector for power monitoring . The higher impedance line results in a higher RF voltage for a given main line power making the work of the detector diode easier . 
 The frequency range specified by manufacturers is that of the coupled line . The main line response is much wider : for instance a coupler specified as 2 – 4 GHz might have a main line which could operate at 1 – 5 GHz . As with all distributed element circuits , the coupled response is periodic with frequency . For example , a λ / 4 coupled line coupler will have responses at <unk> / 4 where n is an odd integer . 
 A single λ / 4 coupled section is good for bandwidths of less than an octave . To achieve greater bandwidths multiple λ / 4 coupling sections are used . The design of such couplers proceeds in much the same way as the design of distributed element filters . The sections of the coupler are treated as being sections of a filter , and by adjusting the coupling factor of each section the coupled port can be made to have any of the classic filter responses such as maximally flat ( Butterworth filter ) , equal @-@ ripple ( Cauer filter ) , or a specified @-@ ripple ( <unk> filter ) response . Ripple is the maximum variation in output of the coupled port in its passband , usually quoted as plus or minus a value in dB from the nominal coupling factor . 
 It can be shown that coupled line directional couplers have <formula> purely real and <formula> purely imaginary at all frequencies . This leads to a simplification of the S @-@ matrix and the result that the coupled port is always in quadrature phase ( 90 ° ) with the output port . Some applications make use of this phase difference . Letting <formula> , the ideal case of lossless operation simplifies to , 
 <formula> 
 = = = = Branch @-@ line coupler = = = = 
 The branch @-@ line coupler consists of two parallel transmission lines physically coupled together with two or more branch lines between them . The branch lines are spaced λ / 4 apart and represent sections of a multi @-@ section filter design in the same way as the multiple sections of a coupled line coupler except that here the coupling of each section is controlled with the impedance of the branch lines . The main and coupled line are <formula> of the system impedance . The more sections there are in the coupler , the higher is the ratio of impedances of the branch lines . High impedance lines have narrow tracks and this usually limits the design to three sections in planar formats due to manufacturing limitations . A similar limitation applies for coupling factors looser than 10 dB ; low coupling also requires narrow tracks . Coupled lines are a better choice when loose coupling is required , but branch @-@ line couplers are good for tight coupling and can be used for 3 dB hybrids . Branch @-@ line couplers usually do not have such a wide bandwidth as coupled lines . This style of coupler is good for implementing in high @-@ power , air dielectric , solid bar formats as the rigid structure is easy to mechanically support . 
 = = = = Lange coupler = = = = 
 The construction of the Lange coupler is similar to the interdigital filter with paralleled lines interleaved to achieve the coupling . It is used for strong couplings in the range 3 dB to 6 dB . 
 = = = Power dividers = = = 
 The earliest transmission line power dividers were simple T @-@ junctions . These suffer from very poor isolation between the output ports – a large part of the power reflected back from port 2 finds it way into port 3 . It can be shown that it is not theoretically possible to simultaneously match all three ports of a passive , lossless three @-@ port and poor isolation is unavoidable . It is , however , possible with four @-@ ports and this is the fundamental reason why four @-@ port devices are used to implement three @-@ port power dividers : four @-@ port devices can be designed so that power arriving at port 2 is split between port 1 and port 4 ( which is terminated with a matching load ) and none ( in the ideal case ) goes to port 3 . 
 The term hybrid coupler originally applied to 3 dB coupled line directional couplers , that is , directional couplers in which the two outputs are each half the input power . This synonymously meant a quadrature 3 dB coupler with outputs 90 ° out of phase . Now any matched 4 @-@ port with isolated arms and equal power division is called a hybrid or hybrid coupler . Other types can have different phase relationships . If 90 ° , it is a 90 ° hybrid , if 180 ° , a 180 ° hybrid and so on . In this article hybrid coupler without qualification means a coupled line hybrid . 
 = = = = Wilkinson power divider = = = = 
 The Wilkinson power divider consists of two parallel uncoupled λ / 4 transmission lines . The input is fed to both lines in parallel and the outputs are terminated with twice the system impedance bridged between them . The design can be realised in planar format but it has a more natural implementation in coax – in planar , the two lines have to be kept apart so they do not couple but have to be brought together at their outputs so they can be terminated whereas in coax the lines can be run side @-@ by @-@ side relying on the coax outer conductors for screening . The Wilkinson power divider solves the matching problem of the simple T @-@ junction : it has low VSWR at all ports and high isolation between output ports . The input and output impedances at each port are designed to be equal to the characteristic impedance of the microwave system . This is achieved by making the line impedance <formula> of the system impedance – for a 50 Ω system the Wilkinson lines are approximately 70 Ω

 Coupled line directional couplers are described above . When the coupling is designed to be 3 dB it is called a hybrid coupler . The S @-@ matrix for an ideal , symmetric hybrid coupler reduces to ;

 The hybrid ring coupler , also called the rat @-@ race coupler , is a four @-@ port 3 dB directional coupler consisting of a <unk> / 2 ring of transmission line with four lines at the intervals shown in figure 12 . Power input at port 1 splits and travels both ways round the ring . At ports 2 and 3 the signal arrives in phase and adds whereas at port 4 it is out of phase and cancels . Ports 2 and 3 are in phase with each other , hence this is an example of a 0 ° hybrid . Figure 12 shows a planar implementation but this design can also be implemented in coax or waveguide . It is possible to produce a coupler with a coupling factor different from 3 dB by making each λ / 4 section of the ring alternately low and high impedance but for a 3 dB coupler the entire ring is made <formula> of the port impedances – for a 50 Ω design the ring would be approximately 70 Ω . 
 The S @-@ matrix for this hybrid is given by ; 
 <formula> 
 The hybrid ring is not symmetric on its ports ; choosing a different port as the input does not necessarily produce the same results . With port 1 or port 3 as the input the hybrid ring is a 0 ° hybrid as stated . However using port 2 or port 4 as the input results in a 180 ° hybrid . This fact leads to another useful application of the hybrid ring : it can be used to produce sum ( Σ ) and difference ( Δ ) signals from two input signals as shown in figure 12 . With inputs to ports 2 and 3 , the Σ signal appears at port 1 and the Δ signal appears at port 4 . 
 = = = = Multiple output dividers = = = = 
 A typical power divider is shown in figure 13 . Ideally , input power would be divided equally between the output ports . <unk> are made up of multiple couplers and , like couplers , may be reversed and used as multiplexers . The drawback is that for a four channel multiplexer , the output consists of only 1 / 4 the power from each , and is relatively inefficient . The reason for this is that at each combiner half the input power goes to port 4 and is dissipated in the termination load . If the two inputs were coherent the phases could be so arranged that cancellation occurred at port 4 and then all the power would go to port 1 . However , multiplexer inputs are usually from entirely independent sources and therefore not coherent . <unk> multiplexing can only be done with filter networks .

 The branch @-@ line coupler described above can also be implemented in waveguide . 
 = = = = Bethe @-@ hole directional coupler = = = = 
 One of the most common , and simplest , waveguide directional couplers is the Bethe @-@ hole directional coupler . This consists of two parallel waveguides , one stacked on top of the other , with a hole between them . Some of the power from one guide is launched through the hole into the other . The Bethe @-@ hole coupler is another example of a backward coupler . 
 The concept of the Bethe @-@ hole coupler can be extended by providing multiple holes . The holes are spaced λ / 4 apart . The design of such couplers has parallels with the multiple section coupled transmission lines . Using multiple holes allows the bandwidth to be extended by designing the sections as a Butterworth , Chebyshev , or some other filter class . The hole size is chosen to give the desired coupling for each section of the filter . Design criteria are to achieve a substantially flat coupling together with high directivity over the desired band . 
 = = = = <unk> short @-@ slot coupler = = = = 
 The <unk> short @-@ slot coupler is two waveguides side @-@ by @-@ side with the side @-@ wall in common instead of the long side as in the Bethe @-@ hole coupler . A slot is cut in the sidewall to allow coupling . This design is frequently used to produce a 3 dB coupler . 
 = = = = Schwinger reversed @-@ phase coupler = = = = 
 The Schwinger reversed @-@ phase coupler is another design using parallel waveguides , this time the long side of one is common with the short side @-@ wall of the other . Two off @-@ centre slots are cut between the waveguides spaced λ / 4 apart . The Schwinger is a backward coupler . This design has the advantage of a substantially flat directivity response and the disadvantage of a strongly frequency @-@ dependent coupling compared to the Bethe @-@ hole coupler , which has little variation in coupling factor . 
 = = = = Moreno crossed @-@ guide coupler = = = = 
 The Moreno crossed @-@ guide coupler has two waveguides stacked one on top of the other like the Bethe @-@ hole coupler but at right angles to each other instead of parallel . Two off @-@ centre holes , usually cross @-@ shaped are cut on the diagonal between the waveguides a distance <formula> apart . The Moreno coupler is good for tight coupling applications . It is a compromise between the properties of the Bethe @-@ hole and Schwinger couplers with both coupling and directivity varying with frequency .

 The hybrid ring discussed above can also be implemented in waveguide . 
 = = = = Magic tee = = = = 
 <unk> power division was first accomplished by means of simple Tee junctions . At microwave frequencies , waveguide tees have two possible forms – the E @-@ plane and H @-@ plane . These two junctions split power equally , but because of the different field configurations at the junction , the electric fields at the output arms are in phase for the H @-@ plane tee and are 180 ° out of phase for the E @-@ plane tee . The combination of these two tees to form a hybrid tee is known as the magic tee . The magic tee is a four @-@ port component which can perform the vector sum ( Σ ) and difference ( Δ ) of two coherent microwave signals . 
 = = Discrete element types = = 
 = = = Hybrid transformer = = = 
 The standard 3 dB hybrid transformer is shown in figure 16 . Power at port 1 is split equally between ports 2 and 3 but in <unk> to each other . The hybrid transformer is therefore a 180 ° hybrid . The centre @-@ tap is usually terminated internally but it is possible to bring it out as port 4 ; in which case the hybrid can be used as a sum and difference hybrid . However , port 4 presents as a different impedance to the other ports and will require an additional transformer for impedance conversion if it is required to use this port at the same system impedance . 
 Hybrid transformers are commonly used in telecommunications for 2 to 4 wire conversion . Telephone handsets include such a converter to convert the 2 @-@ wire line to the 4 wires from the earpiece and mouthpiece . 
 = = = Cross @-@ connected transformers = = = 
 For lower frequencies ( less than 600 MHz ) a compact broadband implementation by means of RF transformers is possible . In figure 17 a circuit is shown which is meant for weak coupling and can be understood along these lines : A signal is coming in one line pair . One transformer reduces the voltage of the signal the other reduces the current . Therefore , the impedance is matched . The same argument holds for every other direction of a signal through the coupler . The relative sign of the induced voltage and current determines the direction of the outgoing signal . 
 The coupling is given by ; 
 <formula> 
 where n is the secondary to primary turns ratio . 
 For a 3 dB coupling , that is equal splitting of the signal between the transmitted port and the coupled port , <formula> and the isolated port is terminated in twice the characteristic impedance – 100 Ω for a 50 Ω system . A 3 dB power divider based on this circuit has the two outputs in 180 ° phase to each other , compared to λ / 4 coupled lines which have a 90 ° phase relationship . 
 = = = Resistive tee = = = 
 A simple tee circuit of resistors can be used as a power divider as shown in figure 18 . This circuit can also be implemented as a delta circuit by applying the Y @-@ Δ transform . The delta form uses resistors that are equal to the system impedance . This can be advantageous because precision resistors of the value of the system impedance are always available for most system nominal impedances . The tee circuit has the benefits of simplicity , low cost , and intrinsically wide bandwidth . It has two major drawbacks ; first , the circuit will dissipate power since it is resistive : an equal split will result in 6 dB insertion loss instead of 3 dB . The second problem is that there is 0 dB directivity leading to very poor isolation between the output ports . 
 The insertion loss is not such a problem for an unequal split of power : for instance <unk> dB at port 3 has an insertion loss less than 0 @.@ 2 dB at port 2 . Isolation can be improved at the expense of insertion loss at both output ports by replacing the output resistors with T pads . The isolation improvement is greater than the insertion loss added . 
 = = = 6 dB resistive bridge hybrid = = = 
 A true hybrid divider / coupler with , theoretically , infinite isolation and directivity can be made from a resistive bridge circuit . Like the tee circuit , the bridge has 6 dB insertion loss . It has the disadvantage that it cannot be used with unbalanced circuits without the addition of transformers ; however , it is ideal for 600 Ω balanced telecommunication lines if the insertion loss is not an issue . The resistors in the bridge which represent ports are not usually part of the device ( with the exception of port 4 which may well be left permanently <unk> internally ) these being provided by the line terminations . The device thus consists essentially of two resistors ( plus the port 4 termination ) . 
 = = Applications = = 
 = = = Monitoring = = = 
 The coupled output from the directional coupler can be used to monitor frequency and power level on the signal without interrupting the main power flow in the system ( except for a power reduction – see figure 3 ) . 
 = = = Making use of isolation = = = 
 If isolation is high , directional couplers are good for combining signals to feed a single line to a receiver for two @-@ tone receiver tests . In figure 20 , one signal enters port P3 and one enters port P2 , while both exit port P1 . The signal from port P3 to port P1 will experience 10 dB of loss , and the signal from port P2 to port P1 will have 0 @.@ 5 dB loss . The internal load on the isolated port will dissipate the signal losses from port P3 and port P2 . If the isolators in figure 20 are neglected , the isolation measurement ( port P2 to port P3 ) determines the amount of power from the signal generator F2 that will be injected into the signal generator F1 . As the injection level increases , it may cause modulation of signal generator F1 , or even injection phase locking . Because of the symmetry of the directional coupler , the reverse injection will happen with the same possible modulation problems of signal generator F2 by F1 . Therefore , the isolators are used in figure 20 to effectively increase the isolation ( or directivity ) of the directional coupler . Consequently , the injection loss will be the isolation of the directional coupler plus the reverse isolation of the isolator . 
 = = = Hybrids = = = 
 Applications of the hybrid include monopulse <unk> , mixers , power combiners , dividers , modulators , and phased array radar antenna systems . Both in @-@ phase devices ( such as the Wilkinson divider ) and quadrature ( 90 ° ) hybrid couplers may be used for coherent power divider applications . An example of quadrature hybrids being used in a coherent power combiner application is given in the next section . 
 An inexpensive version of the power divider is used in the home to divide cable TV or over @-@ the @-@ air TV signals to multiple TV sets and other devices . <unk> splitters with more than two output ports usually consist internally of a number of cascaded couplers . Domestic broadband internet service can be provided by cable TV companies ( cable internet ) . The domestic user 's internet cable modem is connected to one port of the splitter . 
 = = = Power combiners = = = 
 Since hybrid circuits are bi @-@ directional , they can be used to coherently combine power as well as splitting it . In figure 21 , an example is shown of a signal split up to feed multiple low power amplifiers , then recombined to feed a single antenna with high power . 
 The phases of the inputs to each power combiner are arranged such that the two inputs are 90 ° out of phase with each other . Since the coupled port of a hybrid combiner is 90 ° out of phase with the transmitted port , this causes the powers to add at the output of the combiner and to cancel at the isolated port : a representative example from figure 21 is shown in figure 22 . Note that there is an additional fixed 90 ° phase shift to both ports at each combiner / divider which is not shown in the diagrams for simplicity . Applying in @-@ phase power to both input ports would not get the desired result : the quadrature sum of the two inputs would appear at both output ports – that is half the total power out of each . This approach allows the use of numerous less expensive and lower @-@ power amplifiers in the circuitry instead of a single high @-@ power <unk> . Yet another approach is to have each solid state amplifier ( SSA ) feed an antenna and let the power be combined in space or be used to feed a lens attached to an antenna . 
 = = = Phase difference = = = 
 The phase properties of a 90 ° hybrid coupler can be used to great advantage in microwave circuits . For example , in a balanced microwave amplifier the two input stages are fed through a hybrid coupler . The <unk> device normally has a very poor match and reflects much of the incident energy . However , since the devices are essentially identical the reflection coefficients from each device are equal . The reflected voltage from the FETs are in phase at the isolated port and are 180 ° different at the input port . Therefore , all of the reflected power from the FETs goes to the load at the isolated port and no power goes to the input port . This results in a good input match ( low VSWR ) . 
 If phase @-@ matched lines are used for an antenna input to a 180 ° hybrid coupler as shown in figure 23 , a null will occur directly between the antennas . To receive a signal in that position , one would have to either change the hybrid type or line length . To reject a signal from a given direction , or create the difference pattern for a monopulse radar , this is a good approach . 
 Phase @-@ difference couplers can be used to create beam tilt in a VHF FM radio station , by delaying the phase to the lower elements of an antenna array . More generally , phase @-@ difference couplers , together with fixed phase delays and antenna arrays , are used in beam @-@ forming networks such as the Butler matrix , to create a radio beam in any prescribed direction . 
 = Operation Stinger = 
 Operation Stinger ( Croatian : Operacija <unk> ; Serbian : Operacija <unk> ) was an offensive undertaken by the forces of the SAO Krajina , an unrecognized Croatian Serb region opposing the Republic of Croatia , against positions held by the Croatian police in the region of Banovina on 26 – 27 July 1991 , during the Croatian War of Independence . It was primarily aimed at police stations in Glina and Kozibrod , as well as police @-@ held positions in a string of villages between the town of Dvor and Kozibrod . In addition to Glina and Kozibrod , heavy fighting took place in the village of Struga , north of Dvor , where Croatian Serb forces employed a human shield consisting of Croat civilians taken from their homes in Struga and the nearby village of Zamlača . 
 The Croatian Serb rebels captured the police station in Glina , but were stopped in Struga before the Yugoslav People 's Army ( JNA ) arrived there to create a buffer zone and , according to the JNA , assist the Croatian police to evacuate . On 29 July , as the non @-@ Serb civilian population left Kozibrod and the villages to the south of it , the police station in Kozibrod was evacuated as well . The fighting resulted the bulk of the region being transferred to Croatian Serb and JNA control . 
 In the aftermath of the fighting , a number of Croatian Serb troops threatened the regional commander in Dvor , blaming him for the deaths of members of their unit in the fighting . Afterwards , they killed several Croat civilians who were undergoing treatment at the Dvor medical centre . Croatian authorities filed war crime charges against Dragan Vasiljković , specifically for leading the attack in Glina which resulted in civilian deaths , as well as injuring and killing prisoners of war . Vasiljković was arrested in Australia in 2006 , and as of January 2015 he is awaiting extradition to Croatia . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1990 , ethnic tensions between Serbs and Croats worsened after the electoral defeat of the government of the Socialist Republic of Croatia by the Croatian Democratic Union ( Croatian : Hrvatska demokratska zajednica – HDZ ) . The Yugoslav People 's Army ( Serbian Latin : Jugoslovenska Narodna Armija – JNA ) confiscated Croatia 's Territorial Defence ( Croatian : Teritorijalna obrana – TO ) weapons to minimize resistance . On 17 August , the tensions escalated into an open revolt of the Croatian Serbs , centred on the predominantly Serb @-@ populated areas of the Dalmatian hinterland around Knin ( approximately 60 kilometres ( 37 miles ) north @-@ east of Split ) , parts of the Lika , Kordun , Banovina and eastern Croatia . In January 1991 , Serbia , supported by Montenegro and Serbia 's provinces of Vojvodina and Kosovo , unsuccessfully tried to obtain the Yugoslav Presidency 's approval for a JNA operation to disarm Croatian security forces . The request was denied and a bloodless skirmish between Serb insurgents and Croatian special police in March prompted the JNA itself to ask the Federal Presidency to give it wartime authority and declare a state of emergency . Even though the request was backed by Serbia and its allies , the JNA request was refused on 15 March . Serbian President Slobodan Milošević , preferring a campaign to expand Serbia rather than to preserve Yugoslavia with Croatia as a federal unit , publicly threatened to replace the JNA with a Serbian army and declared that he no longer recognized the authority of the federal Presidency . The threat caused the JNA to abandon plans to preserve Yugoslavia in favour of expansion of Serbia as the JNA came under Milošević 's control . By the end of March , the conflict had escalated with the first fatalities . In early April , leaders of the Serb revolt in Croatia declared their intention to amalgamate the areas under their control with Serbia . These were viewed by the Government of Croatia as breakaway regions . 
 At the beginning of 1991 , Croatia had no regular army . To bolster its defence , Croatia doubled its police numbers to about 20 @,@ 000 . The most effective part of the Croatian police force was 3 @,@ 000 @-@ strong special police comprising twelve battalions organised along military lines . There were also 9 @,@ 000 – 10 @,@ 000 regionally organised reserve police in 16 battalions and 10 companies , but they lacked weapons . In response to the deteriorating situation , the Croatian government established the Croatian National Guard ( Croatian : Zbor narodne garde – ZNG ) in May by expanding the special police battalions into four all @-@ professional guards brigades . Under Ministry of Defence control and commanded by retired JNA General Martin Špegelj , the four guards brigades comprised approximately 8 @,@ 000 troops . The reserve police , also expanded to 40 @,@ 000 , was attached to the ZNG and reorganised into 19 brigades and 14 independent battalions . The guards brigades were the only units of the ZNG that were fully equipped with small arms ; throughout the ZNG there was a lack of heavier weapons and there was poor command and control structure above the brigade level . The shortage of heavy weapons was so severe that the ZNG resorted to using World War II weapons taken from museums and film studios . At the time , the Croatian weapon stockpile consisted of 30 @,@ 000 small arms purchased abroad and 15 @,@ 000 previously owned by the police . To replace the personnel lost to the guards brigades , a new 10 @,@ 000 @-@ strong special police was established . 
 = = Prelude = = 
 In June , the conflict escalated in the region of Banovina , which had been declared a part of the Serbian Autonomous Oblast Krajina ( SAO Krajina ) by that time . Three municipalities in the region — Dvor , Glina and Hrvatska Kostajnica — had predominantly Serb populations , although all of them were inhabited by a substantial number of non @-@ Serbs as well . On 24 June , the Sisak police administration set up a new police station in the village of Kozibrod in the Una River valley , along the Dvor – Hrvatska Kostajnica road . It was manned by two platoons of police and ZNG troops drawn from the Sisak company of the 2nd Guards Brigade . The new station drew a strong reaction from the SAO Krajina authorities , who issued an ultimatum on the same day the police station was set up , demanded its removal and threatened to remove it by force unless Croatia complied with their ultimatum . 
 On the night of 25 / 26 June , SAO Krajina forces took control of the police station in Dvor and attacked the police station in Glina . The rebels managed to capture the police station in Glina for less than an hour before they were pushed back by the Lučko Anti @-@ Terrorist Unit and police reinforcements deployed from Sisak . Croatian police casualties amounted to one killed and six wounded . Even though the attack in Glina did not leave SAO Krajina in control of the police station in Glina , 16 Croatian policemen were captured and held hostage . The prisoners were taken to the Knin camp and a detention facility in Golubić . In response to the fighting , the JNA deployed its troops to the two towns . New fighting erupted the same day near Hrvatska Kostajnica . In the final days of June , many Serb civilians , especially from Dvor , fled to the area of Bosanski Novi for safety . By 28 June , only a few women , children and the elderly remained in Glina . The town 's shops were closed and its streets were patrolled by JNA armoured vehicles . After the fighting , the JNA positioned its troops around the police station , while the Croatian Serb rebels controlled the rest of the town . 
 In mid @-@ July , Dragan Vasiljković was deployed from the Croatian Serb capital Knin to Banovina to coordinate rebel forces there . By 21 July , his work was commended by local commanders , and two days later , a regional command of Croatian Serb forces was announced at a meeting in Dvor attended by Milan Martić , one of the most prominent SAO Krajina leaders . On 24 July , one day after the regional command was established , the Serb rebels adopted a military plan , presented by Vasiljković , aimed at removing Croatian forces from Banovina . On 25 July , 14 mortar rounds were fired at the Kozibrod police station . Nobody was injured in the attack , and in its aftermath , SAO Krajina authorities requested a ceasefire until 10 August because of the harvest .

 The offensive , codenamed Operation Stinger ( Serbian Latin : Operacija <unk> ) was primarily aimed at the Croat @-@ populated villages between Dvor and Hrvatska Kostajnica , and the police station in the town of Glina . The forces earmarked for the offensive were elements of the 7th Banija Division of the SAO Krajina TO , spearheaded by special police deployed from Knin and commanded by Vasiljković . The operation commenced on 26 July at 10 : 00 with an hour @-@ long mortar bombardment of Glina , Kostajnica and Topusko . Vasiljković set up his headquarters in the <unk> area of Zrinska Gora , situated between Glina , Dvor , Hrvatska Kostajnica and Petrinja . 
 = = = Glina = = = 
 The ground offensive in Glina commenced with a single SAO Krajina soldier tasked with firing on a JNA armoured vehicle from an area close to the police station . This attempted false flag attack was designed to make the vehicle crew believe that they were being fired on by the Croatian police , inducing them to fire at the police station . The original shooter was observed by the police and shot at from the station , which was in turn fired upon by the JNA . A JNA colonel at the scene then threatened to use force against the Serb rebels unless they left the scene . Following consultations with Vasiljković , the SAO Krajina forces moved on towards <unk> , where they shot at a number of civilian buildings including a school and a church , before turning to approach the police station from a different direction . The assault , supported by mortar fire , continued until the following day . The police station was captured on 27 July at 11 : 08 . According to SAO Krajina military reports , 27 Croatian military and police personnel were killed in the fighting . Croatian sources reported the deaths of two policemen and the wounding of two others , as well as the deaths of two civilians , including a German journalist killed by sniper fire . The killed journalist , Egon Scotland , a reporter of the Süddeutsche Zeitung , was leaving Glina with a fellow reporter in a clearly marked car , when he was fatally wounded . The same source indicates that the remaining Croatian police officers managed to pull out of Glina to <unk> . 
 = = = Una River valley = = = 
 The advance against Croat @-@ held villages along the Una was also preceded by an hour @-@ long mortar bombardment of the area . More than 250 rounds were fired , commencing on 26 July at 10 : 00 , after which the infantry was ordered to advance . The attacking force consisted of 50 SAO Krajina special forces troops drawn from Knin , 50 policemen and 700 conscripts . The JNA estimated that there were about 240 – 280 Croatian police and ZNG personnel deployed in the area from Struga to Kozibrod . The SAO Krajina plan saw a battalion led by Braco Orlović advancing north from Dvor through the village of Zamlača to approach the village of Struga . Once there , it was to maintain its position and advance gradually if possible . Additional forces were meant to outflank and pin down the Croatian defending force : a platoon of special forces led by Nikola Sundać , reinforced by a platoon of conscripts , was tasked with bypassing Struga and interdicting traffic along the road between the village of <unk> and Struga , preventing any access from the direction of Kozibrod . Another special forces platoon led by Željko Sanader was tasked with seizing the villages of <unk> and <unk> before advancing towards Kozibrod , while the second battalion attached to the attacking force — led by Mićo Popović — engaged Croatian troops near <unk> , <unk> <unk> and Kozibrod . 
 After Orlović 's battalion entered the undefended village of Zamlača , the Serb rebels moved from one house to the next , ransacking homes and forcing any civilians they found to move to the main road . Approximately 50 civilians were captured in the village , they were then forced to walk in front of an armed vehicle towards Struga , forming a human shield . By 13 : 00 , all the units earmarked for the advance between Dvor and Kozibrod had achieved their initial objectives , except for the platoon commanded by Sundać . By 14 : 30 , Struga was under attack . The defending force in Struga was first engaged by the outflanking force and had no knowledge of what had happened in Zamlača . As the human shield and the SAO Krajina force reached Struga , the defending troops were reluctant to fire against them . As a consequence , three Croatian policemen deployed in one house were surrounded and subsequently surrendered . Their captors stripped them , ordered them to run and then killed them . Unsure how to deal with the situation , the Croatian forces withdrew from the southern part of the village . The unit protected by the human shield moved very slowly and took six hours to move from Zamlača to the centre of Struga . 
 The armed vehicle and the soldiers following the human shield were ambushed in the centre of Struga by a single policeman and a civilian who threw a hand grenade and ran towards the vehicle , carrying three more hand grenades strapped to his waist . As the hand grenades exploded , gunfire erupted allowing the civilians held as human shields to run away . The policeman and civilian who carried out the ambush were both killed ; sources identify the two as reserve policeman Mile Blažević and traffic policeman Željko Filipović . Shortly before 16 : 00 , the Croatian forces counterattacked , causing the bulk of Popović 's troops to flee . Popović and his remaining five or six soldiers retreated . At least five SAO Krajina troops were killed and twenty wounded in fighting in Struga . By 18 : 00 , the battalion led by Orlović had lost 80 percent of its personnel to desertion . Prompted by the desertions and heavy shooting in Struga at 19 : 00 , Bogdan <unk> , the commanding officer of the SAO Krajina units subordinated to the Dvor headquarters , requested that the JNA intervene . The JNA informed <unk> that a unit was dispatched from Petrinja , allowing him to break off further fighting with the Croatian police and send two platoons as reinforcements to Glina as reinforcements at Vasiljković 's request . JNA tanks reached Struga at 19 : 50 to establish a buffer zone . Croatian forces there offered to leave the village if the JNA provided them with one armoured personnel carrier and escorted them to Hrvatska Kostajnica . The JNA complied with the request . During the fighting , 12 Croatian policemen were killed , along with 20 civilians . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 Fighting continued around Topusko , which was besieged by the Serb rebels on 28 July . The same day , heavy fighting also erupted near Hrvatska Kostajnica and Hrvatska Dubica . In Dvor , Sundać and several soldiers from his platoon arrived at the regional SAO Krajina military headquarters threatening the commanding officer , holding him responsible for losses the platoon had suffered in the fighting . The group also demanded that the authorities turn any prisoners over to them , but the demand was refused . Finally , they went to the medical centre in Dvor , where they forced eight wounded Croat civilians and two policemen , out of the building and beat them in front of 100 onlookers . There are conflicting reports that all ten were killed , or that only an unspecified number of female patients were killed . On 29 July , the remaining Croatian civilian population in Struga , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> <unk> accepted an offer made by the JNA to evacuate them to Hrvatska Kostajnica . When the column of evacuating civilians reached Kozibrod , the population of that village also joined them , followed by the police and ZNG troops stationed in Kozibrod . The move left the SAO Krajina and the JNA in control of the bulk of Banovina . 
 = = = Further combat = = = 
 Fighting in the region flared once more on 7 August , with new clashes around Hrvatska Kostajnica and an artillery bombardment of Topusko . On 14 August , the policemen captured in the first attack against the police station in Glina in June were released in a prisoner exchange . Croatian troops and positions held in Hrvatska Kostajnica , as well as in Petrinja and Sisak , were inspected by Croatian President Franjo Tuđman on 25 August . The Croatian position in the region deteriorated further on 9 September when Hrvatska Kostajnica was besieged . Three days later , SAO Krajina forces captured the hill that commanded the town , and the Croatian forces started a breakout from Hrvatska Kostajnica . On 13 September , Hrvatska Kostajnica was captured by SAO Krajina forces , after heavy attacks supported by JNA artillery and tanks forced approximately 300 Croatian troops to retreat or surrender . The capture of the town was followed by killings , looting and torching of buildings in the town and the surrounding villages . A total of 67 Croatian troops were captured in the town and shipped to the jail in Glina , but none arrived . The SAO Krajina forces captured Hrvatska Dubica the same day , and of Topusko on 14 September . On 21 September , Petrinja was captured by SAO Krajina forces and the JNA , denying Croatia an important bridgehead on the south ( right ) bank of the Kupa River . The town 's capture came approximately one month after Martić announced SAO Krajina 's plans to control it . 
 By the end of the month , the Serb rebels and the JNA controlled nearly all of the southern bank of the river , and the lines of control in the region largely stabilised . Before the ceasefire of 3 January 1992 , which implemented the Vance plan , the Serb rebels and the JNA made two more unsuccessful attempts to push back the Croatian forces in the region . These attacks comprised the autumn campaign undertaken by the JNA — in the area of <unk> and Novi Farkašić on 17 – 18 October and in the area of Sunja on 2 November . In the same period , the ZNG launched an unsuccessful offensive codenamed Operation Whirlwind to recapture Glina on 11 – 13 December . The 120 Croats who remained in the area of Dubica faced persecution , culminating in the Baćin massacre of more than 50 Croats on 21 October , and the rounding up and expulsion of the remainder on 20 November . 
 = = = Charges of war crimes = = = 
 According to Australian court documents , on 10 January 2006 , the Šibenik County Court ordered that a warrant be issued for Vasiljković 's arrest . The offences listed were two alleged war crimes against prisoners of war , and one alleged war crime against the civilian population . The latter are related to his role in the attack on Glina which caused civilian deaths and injuries . He was arrested in Australia in 2006 , but as an Australian national , he appealed against extradition to Croatia claiming that he would not get a fair trial there . The appeal was granted by the Federal Court in 2009 , and Vasiljković was released . However , the High Court of Australia overturned the decision and Vasiljković was arrested after a 43 @-@ day search for him by the police . Subsequently , Vasiljković appealed against his extradition citing other grounds . His extradition was approved by the Minister for Home Affairs Jason Clare in November 2012 , however Vasiljković appealed that decision as well . In December 2014 , the Federal Court upheld Clare 's decision . 
 In 1994 , Croatian authorities tried Đuro Đurić , a former SAO Krajina policeman , in absentia on charges of war crimes committed in Struga , Zamlača and Kozibrod . He was convicted and sentenced to twenty years in prison . Đurić surrendered to the Croatian police at the border crossing in Dvor in 2001 . After two months in custody , he was released and left the country . Đurić returned to Croatia in February 2009 , when he was arrested once again on identical charges . One month later , he was released after witnesses were questioned and failed to link him to the war crimes of which he was accused .

 Scotland travelled to the region to investigate the disappearance of a fellow journalist who was thought to have been detained by Croatian Serb forces and assist her . His death in the line of duty , while seeking to help a fellow reporter , had a significant impact on the German media and German public opinion . Scotland 's death reinforced the image of the conflict as a real war where no rules were obeyed . Spurred on by his death , Munich @-@ based journalists established the " Journalists help Journalists " ( German : Journalisten <unk> Journalisten ) association in 1993 to help reporters the way Scotland had intended when he was killed . Scotland 's death also provided the impetus to establish German section of Reporters Without Borders in 1994 .

 The Mitsubishi i ( <unk> ・ i , Mitsubishi i ) is a kei car from automaker Mitsubishi Motors , first released in January 2006 , twenty eight months after its debut at the 2003 Frankfurt Motor Show . It is the first four @-@ door automobile since the 1960s to employ a " rear midship " setup with the engine behind the passengers , in an attempt to improve safety and interior space without enlarging the overall exterior . 
 The innovative layout and styling of the i proved an immediate critical and commercial success , exceeding Mitsubishi 's initial sales targets by 20 percent and winning thirteen awards in its first year . Although designed with the Japanese <unk> light automobile class in mind , the attention it generated led to its subsequent introduction in right hand drive markets in Asia , Oceania and Europe . It is also used as a basis of the 2009 i @-@ MiEV battery electric vehicle . 
 = = Concepts : i , Se @-@ Ro = = 
 Two prototypes were exhibited during the car 's development . The first was the " i " Concept , which debuted at the 60th Frankfurt Motor Show in 2003 , and previewed the car 's striking exterior . Motoring journalists were quick to seize on the distinctive silhouette , calling it " a very good egg " , and a " crystal ball " with which to see the future of Mitsubishi . One reviewer even speculated it to be an allusion by the vehicle 's French @-@ born designer Olivier Boulay to the Renault <unk> , France 's popular post @-@ war " people 's car " with which the i shared its four @-@ seat , rear @-@ engined layout . Its styling was formally lauded when the i won the Grand Prize at the 50th anniversary Good Design Awards from the Japanese Ministry of Economy , Trade and Industry in October 2006 , the first kei car to win the award . 
 Explaining the choice of name , the company claimed that " i " could represent the owner ( I , the nominative personal pronoun ) as an encouragement to personal expression , or innovation , intelligence and imagination , keywords in the car 's development . It was also a play on the Japanese word for love , 愛 ( pronounced [ ai ] ) . 
 The " i " Concept was powered by a 999 cc powerplant with the company 's Mitsubishi Smart Idling ( MSI ) system , which turns off the engine automatically when the vehicle is stationary , and can restart it within 0 @.@ 2 seconds . So equipped , Mitsubishi claimed the car was capable of fuel consumption of no more than 3 @.@ 8 litres per 100 kilometres ( 74 @.@ 3 mpg @-@ imp ; 61 @.@ 9 mpg @-@ US ) . 
 The second prototype , called the Se @-@ Ro and exhibited at the 2003 Tokyo Motor Show , previewed the production model 's more conventional mechanical underpinnings , despite having a more radical appearance which bore little resemblance to the final design . Instead , its polished aluminium body was styled to resemble a zeppelin or airship , which Se @-@ Ro design head Shuji Yamada described as a realization of his fantasies of the future from childhood . The aviation theme continued with the name ; Se @-@ Ro , short for " secret room " , was a veiled reference to the Mitsubishi Zero fighter aircraft of World War II .

 A lightweight steel ( not aluminium ) structure and a rear @-@ engined layout allowed Mitsubishi to incorporate a larger front crumple zone , in order to meet current safety legislation requirements without compromising interior space . With no powertrain in front of the driver , the designers were able to shorten the front overhang and lengthen the wheelbase to 2 @,@ 550 millimetres ( 100 @.@ 4 in ) , giving greater legroom for passengers than many comparable kei cars whose wheelbase is typically 130 – 190 mm ( 5 @.@ 1 – 7 @.@ 5 in ) less . The downside of this design was a reduction in cargo @-@ carrying capacity , which was necessarily compromised by the engine 's location in the rear . 
 = = = Drivetrain = = = 
 The i has a " rear @-@ midship " engine mounted just ahead of the rear axle , a highly unusual configuration in a small car where front @-@ engine design has dominated since the 1970s . The <unk> three @-@ cylinder powerplant has an aluminium cylinder block , a displacement of 659 cubic centimetres , and incorporates double overhead camshafts with <unk> variable valve timing in the cylinder head . Initially only an <unk> and turbocharged engine was offered , until a naturally aspirated version was introduced for 2007 . A four @-@ speed automatic gearbox transmits power to the rear or all four wheels , depending on specification . 
 = = = Suspension , brakes and tires = = = 
 MacPherson struts are used in the front suspension , and an unusual three @-@ link De Dion tube / Watt 's linkage is used in the rear . Front discs with anti @-@ lock braking ( ABS ) and electronic brakeforce distribution ( EBD ) are standard across the range . In common with many other mid- or rear @-@ engined vehicles its fifteen @-@ inch wheels have uneven @-@ sized tires , 145 / 65 on the fronts and wider 175 / 55 on the rears , in an effort to minimise the chances of oversteer caused by the rear @-@ biased weight distribution .

 Three individual models , or grades , were available on the car 's release in 2006 ; S , M , and G , in ascending order of price . They all shared the same five @-@ door hatchback body style and turbocharged engine , but offered differing levels of options and standard equipment . In 2007 the base S model was given the new naturally aspirated powerplant , and was positioned below the two new grades , L and LX , whose engine it shared .

The car , which was described as " the most quintessentially Japanese car ... ever " for fusing two of the country 's cultural icons — Hello Kitty and <unk> — was eventually sold in a charity auction on behalf of UNICEF . 
 Other limited production models include the i Play edition , a run of 3 @,@ 000 cars only available in white or black , and featuring a dashboard @-@ mounted slot for an iPod nano , 
 Also 100 of the i Kurashiki edition with faux denim upholstery , to be sold at a single Mitsubishi dealership in Kurashiki , Okayama , the prefecture where the bulk of Japan 's domestic blue jeans manufacturers are located .

 Mitsubishi has given the i a prominent role in the company 's alternative propulsion research projects , developing a version using their MiEV ( Mitsubishi innovative Electric Vehicle ) technology in 2006 and exhibited at the 22nd International Battery , Hybrid and Fuel Cell Electric Vehicle Symposium & Exposition in Yokohama . MMC provided three power companies with vehicles in 2006 and 2007 in order to evaluate how a " fast @-@ charge " infrastructure might be developed for electric vehicles . Fleet testing by five power companies was conducted later in 2007 , with a view to future public sales between 2008 and 2010 . 
 The Mitsubishi i MiEV electric car was launched in Japan for fleet customers in July 2009 and for the general public in April 2010 . Sales to the public in Hong Kong began in May 2010 , and a trial began in Australia in September 2010 . Sales in several European countries began in late 2010 and between December 2011 and March 2012 for the United States west and east coasts , respectively .

 " What Have You Done for Me Lately " is a song recorded by American singer @-@ songwriter Janet Jackson for her third studio album , Control ( 1986 ) . Jackson co @-@ wrote the song with its producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis , who produced the track . It was released on January 13 , 1986 as the album 's lead single by A & M Records . After two unsuccessful albums and a management change , the singer began developing a new album . " What Have You Done for Me Lately " was originally penned for one of Jam and Lewis 's own records , but the lyrics were rewritten to convey Jackson 's feelings about her recent divorce from James DeBarge in January 1985 . It revolves around a woman 's frustration with her partner in a relationship . 
 Critical reviews for " What Have You Done for Me Lately " were positive , with music critics believing it erased the former " pop @-@ ingénue image " of Jackson 's first two albums , reestablishing her as an " independent woman " figure . The song has been featured in critic lists as one of the greatest songs of all times and received one nomination for Best Rhythm & Blues Song on the 29th annual Grammy Awards of 1987 . The song peaked at number four on the US Billboard Hot 100 and was certified gold by the Recording Industry Association of America ( RIAA ) . It also peaked at number two on the US Dance Club Songs and topped the US Hot R & B / Hip @-@ Hop Songs charts . Outside of the US , it topped the singles chart in the Netherlands and peaked within the top ten in Germany , Switzerland , and the United Kingdom . 
 The accompanying music video for " What Have You Done for Me Lately " was directed by Brian Jones and Piers Ashworth and choreographed by singer Paula Abdul . In it , Jackson goes to a diner with her friends to talk about her relationship problems . The video won a Soul Train Music Award for Best R & B / Soul or Rap Music Video in 1987 . The song was first performed live by Jackson at the 29th annual Grammy Awards in 1987 . She has also performed it live in each of her concert tours , beginning with the Rhythm Nation World Tour 1990 through the Unbreakable World Tour ( 2015 @-@ 2016 ) . It has been included in each of Jackson 's greatest hits albums Design of a Decade : 1986 – 1996 ( 1995 ) , Number Ones ( 2009 ) and Icon : Number Ones ( 2010 ) . " What Have You Done for Me Lately " has been sampled and covered by various artists , and is also regarded as one of Jackson 's signature songs which helped establish her as a known artist .

 After arranging a recording contract with A & M Records in 1982 for a then sixteen @-@ year @-@ old Janet , her father Joseph Jackson oversaw the entire production of her debut album , Janet Jackson , and its follow @-@ up , Dream Street ( 1984 ) ; the latter of which was written and produced by Jesse Johnson and Janet 's brothers Marlon and Michael . Jackson was initially reluctant to begin a recording career , commenting " I was coming off of a TV show that I absolutely hated doing , Fame . I didn 't want to do [ the first record , Janet Jackson ] . I wanted to go to college . But I did it for my father ... " and elaborated that she was often in conflict with her producers . Amidst her professional struggles , she rebelled against her family 's wishes by marrying James DeBarge of the family recording group DeBarge in 1984 . The Jacksons disapproved of the relationship , citing DeBarge 's immaturity and substance abuse . Jackson left her husband in January 1985 and was granted an annulment later that year . 
 Jackson subsequently fired her father as her manager and hired John McClain , then A & M Records ' senior vice president of artists and repertoire and general manager . Commenting on the decision , she stated , " I just wanted to get out of the house , get out from under my father , which was one of the most difficult things that I had to do , telling him that I didn 't want to work with him again . " Joseph Jackson resented John McClain for what he saw as an underhanded attempt to steal his daughter 's career out from under him . McClain responded by saying " I 'm not trying to pimp Janet Jackson or steal her away from her father . " He subsequently introduced her to the songwriting and production duo James " Jimmy Jam " Harris III and Terry Lewis , former Prince associates and ex @-@ members of The Time .

 Although Joseph Jackson initially demanded that his daughter 's new album be recorded in Los Angeles so that he could keep an eye on her , Jam and Lewis refused . They required the entire production of the album to be done at their own studio in Minneapolis , Minnesota , " far from the glitter and distractions of Hollywood and the interference of manager @-@ fathers . " Control was recorded at Flyte Tyme Studios , the site for Flyte Tyme Records , founded by Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis in Minneapolis . Jackson recorded the whole album , but A & M label executive and manager John McClain wanted one more uptempo song to compose the album . She then went back to Minneapolis to record one more track , titled " What Have You Done for Me Lately " , which was originally penned for one of Jam and Lewis 's own records . Jam remembered , " She was sitting outside in the lounge and said , ' Man , that 's a funky track . Who 's that for ? ' And we said , ' It 's for you ' , and she said , ' Oh , cool ' . I think she was very pleased when she heard the track " . 
 The lyrics were rewritten to convey Jackson 's feelings about her recent annulment from James DeBarge . It was the last song to be recorded for Control , and was ultimately chosen as the lead single for the album , as Jam and Lewis felt it best represented Jackson 's outlook on life : " I think it was very representative of the sparseness and the funkiness that the rest of the album had and the attitude Janet had about being in control , being mature to the point where she had definite opinions about what she wanted to say " . The song was inspired by one of her experiences in Minneapolis when a group of men made sexual advances towards her outside the hotel she resided at during the recording of Control . She recalled , " They were emotionally abusive . Sexually threatening . Instead of running to Jimmy or Terry for protection , I took a stand . I backed them down . That 's how songs like ' Nasty ' and ' What Have You Done for Me Lately ' were born , out of a sense of self @-@ defense . "

 Musically , " What Have You Done for Me Lately " is described as an uptempo dance song . It begins with a conversation with one of her friends , who asks Jackson the title question . Lyrically , it involves the singer asking why her lover was not as attentive as he once was . He was not treating her as well as he used to , and she calls him a " loser " in response . " I never ask for more than I deserve , you know it 's the truth . You seem to think you 're God 's gift to this earth . I 'm telling you no way " , Jackson sings . Veda A. McCoy in the book <unk> : Six Winning Strategies to a Life of Purpose , Passion & Power expressed that the song reminded that " life is about more than just what you say . Life is also about what you do " . Vibe noted that with " What Have You Done for Me Lately " , Jackson stands up for men . New York magazine 's Chris Smith called the song 's chorus " fully belligerent " . In a Billboard publication , Nelson George noted its " <unk> , <unk> " beat . Ed Gonzalez from Slant Magazine commented , " Nothing sends me into a trembling , corner @-@ cowering stupor than a giggly , under @-@ enunciated Janet Jackson jam . "
