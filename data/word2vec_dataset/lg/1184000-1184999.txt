 Notorious scenes in the play include " the china scene " , a sustained double entendre dialogue mostly heard from off stage , where Horner is purportedly discussing his china collection with two of his lady friends . The husband of Lady Fidget and the grandmother of Mrs. Squeamish are listening front stage and nodding in approval , failing to pick up the double meaning which is obvious to the audience . Lady Fidget has already explained to her husband that Horner " knows china very well , and has himself very good , but will not let me see it lest I should beg some . But I will find it out , and have what I came for yet " ( <unk> ) . Dialogue such as this made " china " a dirty word in common conversation , Wycherley later claimed . 
 In another famous scene Lady Fidget 's self @-@ styled " virtuous gang " meet up at Horner 's lodging to carouse , throw off their public virtue , and behave exactly like male rakes , singing riotous songs and drinking defiant toasts . Finally each of the ladies triumphantly declares that Horner himself is the very lover they have been toasting , and a mayhem of jealousy breaks out as they realise that their friends have also been receiving Horner 's favours . But they quickly realise they have no choice but to keep the scandalous secret : " Well then , there 's no remedy , sister sharers , let us not fall out , but have a care of our honour " ( <unk> ) . 
 A scene of the Pinchwife plot that combines farce and nightmare is Pinchwife 's attempt to force Mrs Pinchwife to write a haughty farewell letter to Horner , using the Freudian threat to " write whore with this penknife in your face " ( <unk> ) . Like all Pinchwife 's efforts it misfires , giving Mrs Pinchwife instead an opportunity to send Horner a fan letter .

 = = = The Dynamics of Marriage = = = 
 People marry for the sake of outward appearances , for example Alithea feels that she has no choice but to marry Sparkish because her status in society expects her to . Wives are treated as property as made evident by Pinchwife who locks Margery in her room and forbids her from speaking to men . Sir Jasper ’ s marriage to Lady Fidget is beneficial to his business ; therefore he treats her as his asset . He constantly asks Horner to “ watch ” her so that she will have no opportunity to make a cuckold out of him . Furthermore , there is a struggle for dominance between men and women . As Pinchwife says , ‘ ” If we do not cheat women , they ’ ll cheat us ” is the very basis for the chief plot of the play , “ which centers upon the exchange of positions of dominance within his own family . ” Pinchwife decides to marry a country woman in the hopes that she will not be clever enough to know how to cheat , but his extremes in preventing her exposure to men leads to his downfall . Only the women are expected to remain faithful to their husbands . As a result , Lady Fidget “ uses sex as a means of revenge against their husbands and achieve a kind of moral victory over them by making them what they most fear to be – <unk> . ”

 Initially , Horner is confident that he can seek out the married women who are willing to have affairs because they are the ones who do not care about their honor . Horner seems to believe he is in a position of power over the women because their extramarital affair is with him , but his power wanes during the duration of the play . In Act 5 , Scene 4 , Lady Fidget , Dainty Fidget , and Mistress Squeamish barge into Horner ’ s lodgings despite his protest , conveying “ his lower position that alludes to his disguise : a lowly eunuch . ” They talk about him as if he was not present , referring to him as a ‘ beast , ’ ‘ toad , ’ and eunuch . Cohen says , “ As the ladies grow in aggressive self @-@ confidence , Lady Fidget also ‘ claps him on the back ’ thereby revealing the altered socio @-@ sexual roles that are now presented . ” While Horner thinks he is manipulating the women , he has “ exhausted his sexual resources and has , in reality , become that impotent and useless object with the world publicly recognizes him to be . ” Horner ’ s true power is not in relationship to the women , but to the men . He shows his dominance over the men he <unk> .

 Andrew Kaufman claims that although Horner may seem to pretend to despise women because of his pretended state as a eunuch , his hatred towards women is real .

His characteristic action , verbally , is to ‘ unmask ’ women . ” 
 = = First performance = = 
 The Country Wife was first performed in January 1675 , by the King 's Company , at the Theatre Royal , Drury Lane . This luxurious playhouse , designed by Christopher Wren and with room for 2 @,@ 000 spectators , had opened only the year before . It was of compact design , retaining in spite of its large seating capacity much of the intimate actor / audience contact of the Elizabethan theatre , still with an almost Elizabethan @-@ size <unk> or apron stage , on which actors would come forward for maximum audience contact . 
 The original cast was listed in the first edition of The Country Wife , as was standard practice , and modern scholars have suggested that this information throws light on Wycherley 's intentions . Wycherley wrote with the original actors in mind , tailoring the roles to their strengths . Also , since the audience consisted mostly of habitual playgoers , authors and directors could use the associations of an actor 's previous repertoire to enrich or undercut a character , effects familiar on television and in the cinema today . 
 Several of the actors were specialised comedians , notably Joseph Haines who played the false @-@ wit character Sparkish , Alithea 's original fiancé . At the outset of his high @-@ profile career as comedian and song @-@ and @-@ dance man , young Haines already had a reputation for eccentricity and dominant stage presence , suggesting that Sparkish is not merely a comic butt for the <unk> Horner , Harcourt , and <unk> to mock , but also a real threat to the romance of Harcourt and Alithea . 
 Pinchwife was played by the elderly Michael Mohun , who was best known for playing menacing villains , such as Volpone and Iago . Mrs. Pinchwife was Elizabeth Boutell or <unk> , a young actress who had " a childish look . Her voice was weak , tho ' very mellow ; she generally acted the young innocent lady whom all the heroes are mad in love with " . Boutell 's previous recorded roles had in fact all been unmarried as well as innocent girls , and Margery was her first married role . Matching Boutell and Mohun as a couple would emphasise " her youth and innocence against Mohun 's age and violence " . The other husband to be cuckolded by Horner , Sir Jaspar Fidget , was played by another elderly actor , William Cartwright , best known for comic parts such as Falstaff . This casting suggests that Sir Jaspar was played as a straightforwardly comic part , while Pinchwife would be " alarming as well as funny " . 
 The male leads Horner and Harcourt were played by the contrasted actors Charles Hart and Edward Kynaston ( or Kenaston ) . The forcefully masculine 45 @-@ year @-@ old Hart " was celebrated for superman roles , notably the arrogant , bloodthirsty <unk> in John Dryden 's Conquest of Granada " , and also for playing rakish comedy heroes with nonchalance and charisma . Many critics credit the personalities and skills of Hart and Nell Gwyn with creating , as much as any playwright did , the famous flirting / bantering Restoration comedy couple . The beautiful androgynous Kynaston , probably in his early thirties , was a different kind of hero . He had started his career in 1660 as the outstanding Restoration female impersonator – " the prettiest woman in the whole house " – before real women entered the profession in the fall of 1660 . ( The 2004 movie Stage Beauty is loosely based on Kynaston 's career . ) 
 John Harold Wilson argues that the famously virile stage presence of Hart as Horner must be taken into account when interpreting the play . As personified by Hart , Horner will have won women not so much through clever trickery as " the old @-@ fashioned way " , by being " dangerously attractive " , and it is only fools like Sir Jaspar Fidget who really believe him harmless . Harcourt / Kynaston , although by 1675 a well @-@ regarded and skilful actor of male roles , would clearly have been overshadowed by Horner / Hart . The actresses associated with each hero must also have tended to make the Horner plot more striking on the stage than the true @-@ love plot . Horner 's primary mistress Lady Fidget , spokeswoman for " the virtuous gang " of secretly sex @-@ hungry town wives , was played by the dynamic Elizabeth Knepp , who Samuel Pepys declared " the most excellent , mad @-@ humoured thing , and sings the noblest I 've ever heard " , talents that the famous drinking scene in Horner 's lodging seems designed to do justice to . By contrast , the choice of the bit @-@ part actress Elizabeth James as Alithea would have de @-@ emphasised the Harcourt @-@ Alithea plot . Such historical considerations have made modern critics sceptical of Norman Holland 's classic 1959 " right way / wrong way " interpretation of the play , which positions the true @-@ love plot as the most important one . 
 = = Stage history = = 
 The play had a good initial run , although Horner 's trick and the notorious china scene immediately raised offence . Wycherley laughed off such criticisms in his next play , The Plain Dealer ( 1676 ) , where he has the hypocritical Olivia exclaim that the china scene in The Country Wife " has quite taken away the reputation of poor china itself , and sullied the most innocent and pretty furniture of a lady 's chamber " . Olivia 's sensible cousin Eliza insists that she 'll go see The Country Wife anyway : " All this will not put me out of conceit with china , nor the play , which is acted today , or another of the same beastly author 's , as you call him , which I 'll go see . " Writing himself into The Plain Dealer as the " beastly author " of the china scene , Wycherley seems more amused than repentant . The Country Wife did in fact survive the complaints to become a dependable repertory play from 1675 till the mid @-@ 1740s , but by then public taste had changed too much to put up with the sex jokes any longer . Its last eighteenth century performance in 1753 was followed by a hiatus of 171 years , until the successful Phoenix Society production in 1924 at the Regent Theatre in London . The first @-@ ever American performance of Wycherley 's original Country Wife took place in 1931 . 
 During its long banishment from the stage , The Country Wife continued a shadowy existence in the form of David Garrick 's cleaned @-@ up version The Country Girl ( 1766 ) , where Margery is a virgin and Horner her romantic lover . This play was very popular , going through at least twenty editions , reaching the New York stage in 1794 , and surviving in both London and New York into the twentieth century . The few modern critics who have read Garrick 's version typically dismiss it as " sentimental and boring , where The Country Wife is astringent and provocative " . Wycherley 's original is now again a stage classic , with countless professional and amateur performances , an actors ' favourite because of the high number of good parts it offers . The movie Shampoo ( 1975 ) , with Warren Beatty as the Horner character , is a somewhat distant version of The Country Wife after exactly 300 years , reportedly inspired by the Chichester Festival production of 1969 . There was a BBC Play of the Month production of The Country Wife , in 1977 , in which Anthony Andrews plays Horner and Helen Mirren plays Margery . 
 The Country Wife was also restaged as a musical – Lust . Written by the Heather Brothers , it was first performed at the Queens Theatre in Hornchurch in the London Borough of Havering in 1992 . It later transferred to the Theatre Royal Haymarket in London 's West End , starring Denis Lawson as Horner . The production & Lawson then moved to the John Houseman Theatre in New York in 1995 . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 From its creation until the mid @-@ 20th century , The Country Wife was subject to both aesthetic praise and moral outrage . Many critics through the centuries have acknowledged its linguistic energy and wit , including even Victorians such as Leigh Hunt , who praised its literary quality in a selection of Restoration plays that he published in 1840 ( itself a daring undertaking , for reputedly " obscene " plays that had been long out of print ) . However , in an influential review of Hunt 's edition , Thomas Babington Macaulay swept aside questions of literary merit , claiming with indignation that " Wycherley 's indecency is protected against the critics as a skunk is protected against the hunters . It is safe , because it is too filthy to handle and too noisome even to approach . " Margery Pinchwife , regarded in Wycherley 's own time as a purely comic character , was denounced by Macaulay as a scarlet woman who threw herself into " a licentious intrigue of the lowest and least sentimental kind " . 
 It was Macaulay , not Hunt , who set the keynote for the 19th century . The play was impossible equally to stage and to discuss , forgotten and obscure . 
 Academic critics of the first half of the 20th century continued to approach The Country Wife gingerly , with frequent warnings about its " heartlessness " , even as they praised its keen social observation . At this time nobody found it funny , and positive criticism tried to rescue it as satire and social criticism rather than as comedy . Macaulay 's " licentious " Mrs. Pinchwife becomes in the 20th century a focus for moral concern : to critics such as <unk> <unk> , she is a tragic character , destined to have her naiveté cruelly taken advantage of by the " grim , nightmare figure " of Horner . 
 = = Modern criticism = = 
 The past fifty years have seen a major change , and academic critics have acknowledged the play as a powerful and original work . Norman Holland 's widely influential proposal in 1959 of a " right way / wrong way " reading took Wycherley 's morality with innovative seriousness and interpreted the play as presenting two bad kinds of masculinity – Horner 's <unk> and Pinchwife 's possessiveness – and recommending the golden mean of Harcourt , the true lover , the representative of mutual trust in marriage . A competing milestone approach of the same generation is that of Rose <unk> ( 1965 ) , who discusses the play in generic and historical terms as a fierce social satire . 
 Both these types of reading have now fallen out of favour ; there is little consensus about the meaning of The Country Wife , but its " notorious resistance to interpretation " is having an invigorating rather than damping effect on academic interest . The play 's ideological dimension has been emphasised recently . It was written by a courtier for a courtly and aristocratic audience , and Douglas Canfield has pointed to an unusual complication for a courtly play . Horner 's acts of cuckolding aggression are directed not only at disrupting middle @-@ class families of " the City " , in the usual way of the aristocratic Restoration rake , but also at his own , upper , class , the inhabitants of " the Town " – the new and fashionable quarters ( the future West End ) that had sprung up west of the medieval City walls after the Great Fire of London in 1666 . The courtier code proposed by Wycherley is of a sexual game . Eve <unk> Sedgwick argued in Between Men that the game is played not between men and women , but between men by means of women , who are merely the " conduits " of homosocial desire between men . The hierarchy of wits meant that the wittiest and most virile man would win at the game . Thus Horner , as Canfield puts it , " represents not just class superiority , but that subset of class represented by the Town wits , a privileged minority that ... is the jet set identified with the Town and the Court as the loci of real power in the kingdom . " The aggressive attack mounted in the china scene against the class and the generation by which Wycherley was patronised with the expectation that he would defend it ( against Sir Jaspar Fidget and Lady Fidget ) , suggests Canfield , would only let an audience of that class laugh comfortably if Horner were punished by actual impotence in the end , which he is not . " When the play concludes with no poetical justice that makes Horner really impotent " , writes Canfield , " leaving him instead potent and still on the make , the audience laughs at its own expense : the women of quality nervously because they have been <unk> slandered ; the men of quality nervously because at some level they recognize that class solidarity is just a pleasing fiction . " 
 = Russian monitor Bronenosets = 
 Bronenosets ( Russian : <unk> ) was a Uragan @-@ class monitor built for the Imperial Russian Navy in the mid @-@ 1860s . The design was based on the American Passaic @-@ class monitor , but was modified to suit Russian engines , guns and construction techniques . The ship was only active when the Gulf of Finland was not frozen , but very little is known about her service . She was stricken in 1900 from the Navy List , converted into a coal barge in 1903 and renamed Barzha No. 324 . The ship was lost in a storm sometime during World War I. 
 = = Description = = 
 Bronenosets was 201 feet ( 61 @.@ 3 m ) long overall , with a beam of 46 feet ( 14 @.@ 0 m ) and a draft of 10 @.@ 16 – 10 @.@ 84 feet ( 3 @.@ 1 – 3 @.@ 3 m ) . She displaced 1 @,@ 500 – 1 @,@ 600 long tons ( 1 @,@ 500 – 1 @,@ 600 t ) and her crew numbered eight officers and 88 enlisted men in 1865 . They numbered 10 officers and 100 crewmen in 1877 
 The ship was fitted with a two @-@ cylinder horizontal direct @-@ acting steam engine built by Carr and MacPherson of Saint Petersburg . It drove a single propeller using steam that was provided by two rectangular boilers . Specific information on the output of the ship 's engine has not survived , but it ranged between 340 – 500 indicated horsepower ( 254 – 373 kW ) for all the ships of this class . During Bronenosets 's sea trials on 21 October 1864 , she reached a maximum speed of 7 @.@ 75 knots ( 14 @.@ 35 km / h ; 8 @.@ 92 mph ) and she was the fastest ship in the class . The ship carried a maximum of 190 long tons ( 190 t ) of coal , which gave her a theoretical endurance of 1 @,@ 440 nmi ( 2 @,@ 670 km ; 1 @,@ 660 mi ) at 6 knots ( 11 km / h ; 6 @.@ 9 mph ) . 
 Bronenosets was designed to be armed with a pair of 9 @-@ inch ( 229 mm ) smoothbore muzzle @-@ loading guns purchased from Krupp of Germany and rifled in Russia , but the rifling project was seriously delayed and the ship was completed with nine @-@ inch smoothbores . These lacked the penetration power necessary to deal with ironclads and they were replaced by license @-@ built 15 @-@ inch ( 380 mm ) smoothbore muzzle @-@ loading Rodman guns in 1867 – 68 . The Rodman guns were replaced around 1876 with the originally intended nine @-@ inch rifled guns . 
 All of the wrought @-@ iron armor that was used in the Uragan @-@ class monitors was in 1 @-@ inch ( 25 mm ) plates , just as in the Passaic @-@ class ships . The side of the ship was entirely covered with three to five layers of armor plates , of which the three innermost plates extended 42 inches ( 1 @.@ 1 m ) below the waterline . This armor was backed by wooden beam that had a maximum thickness of 36 inches ( 914 mm ) . The gun turret was protected by eleven layers of armor and the pilothouse above it had eight layers of armor . Curved plates six layers thick protected the base of the funnel up to a height of 7 feet ( 2 @.@ 1 m ) above the deck . Unlike their predecessors , the Uragans were built without deck armor to save weight , but Bronenosets had 0 @.@ 5 @-@ inch ( 12 @.@ 7 mm ) plates added after completion . 
 = = Career = = 
 Construction of the ship began on 17 June 1863 at the Carr and MacPherson Shipyard in Saint Petersburg . Bronenosets was laid down on 24 December 1863 and she was launched on 24 March 1864 . She entered service on 6 June 1865 and cost a total of 1 @,@ 148 @,@ 000 rubles , almost double her contract cost of 600 @,@ 000 rubles . The ship was assigned to the Baltic Fleet upon completion and she , and all of her sister ships except Latnik , made a port visit to Stockholm , Sweden in July – August 1865 while under the command of General Admiral Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich . 
 Sometime after Bronenosets was completed , an armored ring , 5 inches ( 127 mm ) thick and 15 inches ( 381 mm ) tall , was fitted around the base of the turret to prevent splinters from jamming it . Later , an armored , outward @-@ curving bulwark was fitted around the top of the turret to protect any crewmen there . Three sponsons were later added , probably during the 1870s , to the upper portion of the turret . Each sponson , one above the gun ports and one on each side of the turret , mounted a light gun , probably a 1 @.@ 75 @-@ inch ( 44 mm ) Engstrem gun , for defense against torpedo boats . A fourth gun was mounted on a platform aft of the funnel when a hurricane deck was built between the funnel and the turret , also probably during the 1870s . 
 Little is known about the ship 's career other than that she was laid up each winter when the Gulf of Finland froze . Bronenosets was reclassified as a coast defense ironclad on 13 February 1892 and turned over to the Port of Kronstadt for disposal on 6 July 1900 , although she was not stricken until 17 August . During 1903 , the ship was converted into a coal barge by the removal of her turret , her side armor , and its wooden backing , and by the division of her hull into three holds . She was redesignated as Barzha No. 34 , Barzha No. 51 and , in 1914 , Barzha No. 324 . The ship sank in a storm in the Gulf of Finland sometime during World War I. 
 = Deadalive = 
 " Deadalive " ( or " DeadAlive " ) is the fifteenth episode of the eighth season of the science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It was written by executive producers Chris Carter and Frank Spotnitz , and was directed by Tony Wharmby . " Deadalive " explores the series ' alien mythology story arc . Following its North American premiere on April 1 , 2001 , it received a Nielsen household rating of 7 @.@ 3 and was watched by 12 @.@ 4 million viewers . " Deadalive " garnered mixed reviews from television critics ; while most were happy with the return of actor David Duchovny , some criticized the episode 's plot holes . It later won the show 's last Emmy Award , for Outstanding Makeup . 
 The season centers on Federal Bureau of Investigation ( FBI ) special agents Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) and her new partner John Doggett ( Robert Patrick ) — following the alien abduction and death of her former partner , Fox Mulder ( Duchovny ) — who work on cases linked to the paranormal , known as X @-@ Files . In this episode , agent Mulder is buried . After the body of alien abductee Billy Miles ( Zachary Ansley ) revives before an autopsy , assistant director Walter Skinner ( Mitch Pileggi ) orders Mulder 's body to be exhumed . When Mulder 's body is uncovered , weak vital signs are discovered . Meanwhile , rogue FBI agent Alex Krycek ( Nicholas Lea ) uses a nanobot infection in Skinner 's blood as leverage to make him kill Scully 's unborn child . Eventually , Mulder is revived and reunites with Scully . 
 " Deadalive " was a story milestone for the series , re @-@ introducing Duchovny after his abduction by aliens planning to colonize Earth in the seventh @-@ season finale " Requiem " . Spotnitz and Carter deliberately wrote and structured the episode in such a way so as to imply that Duchovny had been written out of the series . " Deadalive " featured several elaborate @-@ make @-@ up scenes , which head make @-@ up effects artist Matthew Mungle was given only six days to complete . The episode has been analyzed for its themes of disease , suffering , healing , salvation and resurrection ; Mulder seemingly rising from the dead has been seen as an allusion to the resurrection of Jesus .

 In the seventh @-@ season finale " Requiem " , FBI special agent Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) was abducted by aliens . In the eighth @-@ season premiere " Within " , John Doggett ( Robert Patrick ) took his place on the X @-@ Files , and worked with Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) to find Mulder . In " This Is Not Happening " , Scully , Doggett and FBI assistant director Walter Skinner ( Mitch Pileggi ) discovered several returned abductees . Although nearly all were in critical condition , a UFO cult , led by the mysterious Absalom ( Judson Scott ) , was using Jeremiah Smith 's ( Roy Thinnes ) healing powers to treat the abductees . Scully headed to their compound , only to discover Mulder 's deceased body in the woods . 
 = = = Events = = = 
 Three months after Mulder 's funeral , Doggett is offered a transfer from the X @-@ Files . He realizes that if he leaves , the office will be closed , as Scully will soon be on maternity leave . Meanwhile , a fishing trawler finds the decomposing body of Billy Miles ( Zachary Ansley ) — an alien abductee who had been taken the same time as Mulder . When Miles revives on the autopsy table , Skinner , despite Doggett 's objections , orders that Mulder 's body be exhumed and brought to a hospital , fearing that he may have been buried alive . When the casket is opened , a decomposing Mulder , contrary to all scientific expectations , shows weak vital signs . 
 Meanwhile , Scully notices that Miles ( now on life support ) has two heartbeats . At the FBI , Kersh unsuccessfully tries to convince Doggett to stop investigating Mulder 's apparent death . A short while later , as Skinner walks down a hallway , rogue agent Alex Krycek ( Nicholas Lea ) activates nanobots that he had previously placed in Skinner 's bloodstream as blackmail . Skinner stumbles in pain , and in an elevator , Krycek reveals himself to Skinner and explains that he has a vaccine which could save Mulder 's life . However , he will only give it if Skinner can ensure that Scully does not give birth to her baby for reasons that he does not disclose . Later , alone in his hospital bed , Miles regains consciousness and goes to take a shower . While doing so , his decaying flesh falls away , revealing a healthy body beneath . He tries to persuade Scully and Doggett that the aliens who abducted him are trying to save humanity . Scully , however , gets a lab report which reveals that Miles 's DNA has substantially changed ; he is now a new being . Skinner later tells Scully that there is a cure for Mulder 's disease , but does not explain Krycek 's demands . 
 From her medical findings , Scully discovers that an alien virus is keeping the abductees alive long enough to cause a radical transformation to take place , similar to the one that Miles experienced . After Scully tells Doggett about the genetic transformation , he visits Absalom , who believes that the abductees are being resurrected into aliens who will eventually conquer Earth . Skinner — torn by his decision — decides to euthanize Mulder by pulling him off of life @-@ support so that Krycek does not get his way . Doggett , however , catches Skinner attempting to remove the support . Skinner explains Krycek 's demands , but Doggett argues that both options are unreasonable because either Scully 's child will die , or Mulder will succumb to the virus . Doggett tries to locate Krycek in the parking lot of the FBI building , but Krycek nearly runs him down with a car , and purposely smashes the vaccine on the ground . Doggett tries to stop him but he escapes . Dejected , Doggett returns to the hospital and tells Skinner he was right not to trust Krycek . He finds Scully preparing Mulder for the now @-@ destroyed vaccine ; She tells Doggett that keeping Mulder on life @-@ support was incubating the virus and hastening it along , and that Skinner effectively saved Mulder 's life by pulling him off life @-@ support , as it made his temperature drop rapidly without affecting his vital signs . She states that she will be able to use a combination of antiviral drugs to kill the alien virus if they can get him and his temperature to stabilize . 
 Later , Scully is sitting by Mulder 's bedside when he regains consciousness . He stares blankly at Scully , and asks " Who are you ? " At first , Scully thinks that Mulder does not remember her . However , she quickly realizes that he is actually playing a practical joke . They laugh , and Mulder asks , " Did anybody miss me ? " Scully responds with tears . Later at the FBI , Kersh expresses his disappointment that Doggett did not take his advice to abandon Mulder 's case and rescinds his offer to promote him . He indicates that he will continue to work on The X @-@ Files with Scully and Mulder .

 At the beginning of season seven , several cast and crew members felt it would be the show 's last . Desiring closure if the show was cancelled , X @-@ Files creator Chris Carter brought back several characters from the series ' pilot for the season finale " Requiem " ; this included most notably Billy Miles , played by Zachary Ansley . After an eighth season of the show was confirmed , the mythology of the ongoing alien story arc for the series changed for both practical and artistic reasons . Former series lead David Duchovny left full @-@ time participation in the series after a lengthy lawsuit during the previous season . To replace him , the show 's producers hired Robert Patrick , although Duchovny eventually agreed to return for half of season eight 's episodes . As such , " Deadalive " was one of the first episodes that Duchovny participated in full @-@ time . Further , Frank Spotnitz , executive producer and co @-@ writer of " Deadalive " , noted that the original mythology of the show had been wrapped up much earlier in " One Son " and " Closure " . To create a " new chapter " in the mythology , and to work around Duchovny 's absence , the storyline for the eighth season focused largely on the search for Mulder in the first half and the introduction of Super Soldiers in the second . Due to the change in style and actors , Carter felt that the eighth season of The X @-@ Files was the end of the " Mulder @-@ Scully era " . 
 Spotnitz wanted " Deadalive " to open in a way that would shock viewers and make them watch the entire episode . He concluded that the best way to do this was to show Mulder 's funeral . He felt that " the death of the hero [ of the series ] was shocking enough " , but that no one expected " Deadalive " to blatantly open with a funeral . He elaborated , " But here we are actually burying the man ... just pushing something as far as you possibly can because the audience can 't quite believe you 're doing it . " The funeral was expensive to film ; several actors , such as Sheila Larken , who played Scully 's mother , needed to be flown in specifically for the scene . Spotnitz later said , " It 's a lot of money to spend but , you know , you just couldn 't really do Mulder 's funeral without having them there , so we did all that . " Despite the fact that the show was filmed in California and under " huge financial pressure " , real snow was used for foreground shots and the background was painted white in post @-@ production . Spotnitz later called the sequence " a fun scene to write and stage " and " a great tease " . 
 On Duchovny 's request , Spotnitz and Carter wrote a larger role for Skinner than usual , giving him the moral dilemma of whether or not to kill Scully 's unborn child or Mulder . In the end , Spotnitz called the effects of his actions , particularly the aftermath of taking Mulder off life support , a " nice sort of unexpected turn " . Scully 's role in " Deadalive " was partly based on the 1954 film Magnificent Obsession , in which a young man accidentally blinds a woman and subsequently becomes a doctor to cure her . Spotnitz noted , " that movie was on my mind and not in a good way when we were imagining Scully in this operating room where Mulder was being worked on . " 
 = = = Filming and effects = = = 
 " Deadalive " was the second episode directed by Tony Wharmby , after the Spotnitz @-@ penned " Via Negativa " . Spotnitz later praised the directing of " Deadalive " as " fantastic " . The majority of the episode — like others from seasons six to nine — was filmed in and around the Los Angeles area . Spotnitz managed to secure sufficient funds to enable the fishing trawler scene to be filmed off the Los Angeles coast , a situation with which he was " very pleased " . He also said that after the series ' move from Vancouver following the fifth season , the J. Edgar Hoover Building set became more important to the show than before . For this reason , the scene in which Skinner collapses was filmed almost entirely on an FBI hallway set . This sequence recalls the sixth season episode " S.R. 819 " , which featured Skinner being poisoned with nanobots by Krycek . 
 Make @-@ up effects artist Matthew Mungle was responsible for portraying the decomposition of Mulder 's and Miles 's bodies . Spotnitz was particularly impressed with Miles 's autopsy scene , calling it " something new to do [ in the ] late stage of the game " . Since human bodies which have decomposed in water become grotesquely deformed , Miles 's body was " a toned @-@ down version of what the reality would be . " To create the scene , plaster bandages were used to create a cast of the front and back of Ansley 's body ; these , in turn , were used to create a fiberglass cast . This was sculpted over with water clay to create the appearance of a bloated body . Afterwards , a mold of the clay was made and a body suit created with latex . As the project proceeded , Mungle sent photos to Carter , who gave final approval . In Miles 's shower scene , a mix of " red goo " , which included strawberry jam , was placed on Ansley 's skin . Fake skin , created from thin pieces of urethane , was then placed on top of this mixture and warm water was pumped through to create the illusion of shedding flesh . Mungle reportedly had only six days to complete the prosthetics for the episode . Mungle later noted that after being told what the scene would entail he asked , " if we can figure something out , could we show it on TV ? " While the studio approved the footage , Spotnitz later called the sequence " awfully graphic " ; he was surprised the sequence got past censors since it would be difficult to show in a PG @-@ rated film . 
 Due to Duchovny 's contract , he was only available for shooting on certain days . Spotnitz commented on the irony of " paying all this money to get [ Duchovny 's ] services for a limited time " only to have him spend most of the episode " in a hospital bed , semi @-@ dead " . He later lamented the limited access to Duchovny as it prevented the " most satisfying use of the actor or character " . Some scenes featuring Mulder were filmed using different people . For instance , the scene of Mulder 's exhumation was filmed with a double who wore a mask of Duchovny 's face . Head make @-@ up artist Cheri Montesanto @-@ Medcalf later said " It was brilliant , because nobody knew that . " For the shots of the stunt double as well as Duchovny later in the episode , she used egg whites and a facial mask to give Mulder 's skin a " really cool , old , dried @-@ up cracked skin effect . " 
 = = Themes = = 
 " Deadalive " , along with other eighth @-@ season episodes , explores the themes of " human resurrection and salvation ... disease , suffering , and healing " . These emerged in the season 's premiere , " Within " , when Scully is shown Mulder 's tombstone . The arc would continue in " The Gift " , with Mulder 's inoperable brain tumor and the resurrection of a temporarily deceased John Doggett . In " Deadalive " , the theme of resurrection reappears in full force . Billy Miles is found dead but revives ; similarly Mulder is buried for three months , but is brought back to life . This sub @-@ theme would continue into the ninth season in episodes such as " Audrey Pauley " . 
 The episode is one of many to feature Mulder as a <unk> figure . In We Want to Believe , Amy Donaldson writes that the episode is the most dramatic of Mulder 's " multiple resurrections " . She compares his resurrection to Jesus 's , who Mulder outdoes " by staying in the grave for three months instead of simply three days . " During Mulder 's funeral the minister reads John 11 : 25 – 26 : " Whosoever liveth and believeth in me shall never die " . According to scripture , Jesus spoke these words when he raised Lazarus of Bethany from the dead ; biblical scholars note that the verse also foreshadows his resurrection . The verse was also used by a necromancer in the seventh @-@ season 's " Millennium " , but for the wrong reason . The necromancer wants to raise the dead by reciting the verse , but only their bodies return as zombies . In " Deadalive " , Mulder returns from the dead in both mind and body . 
 Donaldson also draws parallels between the eighth season of the show and the Gospels , and between the ninth season and the Acts of the Apostles . In the Gospels , Jesus is brought back to life but then leaves his followers , allowing them to spread his message ; this is recorded in Acts , the fifth book of the New Testament . In The X @-@ Files , Mulder follows a similar course . After returning to life in " Deadalive " , he investigates several cases that season , but disappears at the beginning of season nine in " Nothing Important Happened Today " . During the final season , his quest is continued by Scully , Doggett and Monica Reyes .

 " Deadalive " premiered on American television on April 1 , 2001 . The episode earned a Nielsen household rating of 7 @.@ 3 with an 11 @-@ percent share , meaning it was viewed by 7 @.@ 3 percent of all television @-@ equipped households , and 11 percent of those watching television . It was watched by 12 @.@ 4 million viewers overall . It won for Outstanding Makeup For a Series at the 53rd Primetime Emmy Awards in 2001 ; it would be the last Emmy win for The X @-@ Files . " Deadalive " was first released as a single @-@ episode DVD in the United Kingdom on August 6 , 2001 for Region 2 . On November 4 , 2003 the episode was released as part of the eighth season DVD box set . The episode was later included on The X @-@ Files Mythology , Volume 4 – Super Soldiers , a DVD collection of episodes in the Super Soldiers story arc . 
 = = = Reviews = = = 
 The episode received mixed reviews ; many critics praised the return of Fox Mulder , although others felt that the episode had various plot holes and was overcomplicated . Robert Shearman and Lars Pearson , in their book Wanting to Believe : A Critical Guide to The X @-@ Files , Millennium & The Lone Gunmen , gave " Deadalive " a full five stars and called its humor and simplistic plot the " icing on the cake . " They praised its stylistic difference from the preceding episode , " This Is Not Happening " , which they described as " atmospheric and doom @-@ laden " . The two called " Deadalive " a " slice of sci @-@ fi hokum , with action scenes , bits of grisly horror [ and ] a reexamination of the show 's mythology " . Jessica Morgan from Television Without Pity gave the episode an " A − " and wrote , " Never go away again , David ! I take back everything bad I ever said about you ! I love you as much as ever ! " 
 Likewise George Avalos and Michael Liedtke of the Contra Costa Times praised the on @-@ screen return of characters such as Mulder and Krycek . They felt so many eighth @-@ season episodes worked well because " Chris Carter seems to be taking an even more active role in the series that is most closely identified with him . " Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a " B + " and wrote that , " it ’ s a measure of a show ’ s effectiveness to see how convincingly the writers can threaten a major character , and have that character ’ s subsequent survival not be a cheat " , in regards to Mulder 's resurrection . He applauded the fact that the episode is suspenseful , even though the ending has a certain inevitability . Handlen also positively commented on both Anderson 's performance — although pointing out that she " is largely pushed to the side for the majority " of the episode — and Lea 's reappearance , noting that " it 's always fun to see Krycek " . However , he argued that the conclusion " makes less sense the more you think about it " , but that the final scene with Mulder and Scully " makes up for the contrivance . " 
 Not all reviews were positive . Paula Vitaris from CFQ gave the episode one @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of four . She criticized its storyline , noting a number of plot holes — such as Mulder 's survival for three months without food or water — and the fact that his body was neither autopsied nor embalmed . Tom Kessenich , in Examination : An Unauthorized Look at Seasons 6 – 9 of the X @-@ Files , called the plot " wooden and convoluted " and felt that it " set the stage for ... the countdown toward the end of Fox Mulder 's time on The X @-@ Files " . However , he complimented Anderson on her " effective " performance . 
 SFX magazine ranked the episode as the sixth " Top 10 <unk> " , reasoning that it allowed Mulder to be around for the series finale a year later . However , the magazine felt his return made " poor Robert Patrick ’ s Agent Doggett a bit superfluous " , and that the plot was rather complicated . In a list comparing Fringe episodes with those of the X @-@ Files , UGO Networks writer Alex Zalben named " Deadalive " as the best resurrection story , beating out Fringe 's " Unearthed " . Zalben cited the " emotional reunion at the end " as the deciding factor , though " both [ episodes ] kind of suck " .

 Tom Weisner ( born c . 1949 ) is an American politician . He is the mayor of Aurora , Illinois , which is the second largest municipality in the state . He won re @-@ election on April 9 , 2013 . Prior to his election he worked for over eighteen years in high @-@ ranking positions in the city of Aurora and for five years as a volunteer in the Peace Corps . 
 He has been involved in several interstate new stories . In 2007 , he was embroiled in an interstate advertising controversy when the Governor of Kentucky used video footage of the local casino taken on a visit to Aurora for his re @-@ election campaign , which included a platform against gambling . In 2008 , his city @-@ wide wifi installation initiative was halted due to change in business strategy by the installing company . His decision @-@ making skills again made headlines outside of Illinois when a Planned Parenthood clinic 's permits became an issue . 
 = = Background = = 
 Weisner is a native of Batavia , Illinois , but moved to Aurora thirty years before becoming a political candidate . Weisner has been married to Marilyn Hogan Weisner sine 1972 . The <unk> raised two sons ; Thaddeus , who died in 2006 , and Anthony . Weisner earned his bachelor 's degree from Aurora University in organizational management . 
 Prior to becoming an Aurora city employee in 1986 , Weisner worked in the private sector and spent five years in the Solomon Islands , where he gave medical services and other assistance to natives with the Peace Corps and International Human Assistance Program . He and his wife were stationed in rain forests on the Island of Guadalcanal . 
 Weisner had held several department head positions in Aurora since beginning his first position as emergency service coordinator in January 1986 . By fall 1987 , Weisner had become the superintendent of the Aurora Department of Motor Vehicles . He later served as the director of equipment services for Aurora and was subsequently appointed Aurora 's director of public property in a 1991 city hall reorganization . In 1999 , he was appointed Aurora 's director of community services and organizational development , which was his last position before running for public office . He resigned from this position in February 2004 during the city 's water contamination crisis . The city 's residents were under a boil water order at the time of his resignation . The order to boil drinking water contaminated with E. coli bacteria lasted for ten days . 
 Weisner served as a delegate to the 2012 Democratic National Convention . 
 = = Campaign = = 
 In November 2002 , two @-@ term incumbent David Stover announced he would not seek re @-@ election . In May 2003 , Weisner announced he would run for election in the February 22 , 2005 municipal primary election . Weisner announced his candidacy for mayor almost two years before the election , in order to solidify his base of support , which might have gone to other potential candidates if he waited . Eventually , a final field of five contested for the two spots on the ballot for the April 5 , 2005 general election , but Weisner had endorsements from eight of the twelve city council members and a huge funding advantage . 
 In the first Aurora mayoral race without an incumbent in twenty years , Democrat Weisner garnered 60 % of the vote and Republican Richard Irvin finished second with 33 % to advance to the general election . Irvin was the only African @-@ American in the race . Weisner won eight of the city 's 10 wards and nearly two @-@ thirds of its precincts . When Obama visited Aurora on February 25 for his 10th town hall meeting after his 2004 United States Senate election in Illinois , he noted that as a Democrat he was inclined to support Weisner , but he made no endorsement . However , in the final days before the general election , Obama returned to endorse Weisner . The day after the election , the Chicago Tribune reported Weisner took 59 % of the vote , and the Chicago Sun @-@ Times reported that he took 68 % . When the results were finally tabulated in Aurora , which spans four counties , the Tribune turned out to be correct . Weisner took the oath of office on April 26 , 2005 . 
 = = Mayor = = 
 During the first few weeks of his tenure as mayor , he made national news by considering passing an ordinance against untimely holiday decorations , when citizens complained of Christmas decorations abounding during the summer . At about the same time in June 2005 , he was considering proposing a strict whistleblower protection ordinance in response to an alderman bribery scandal . 
 In July 2007 , first @-@ term Kentucky Governor Ernie Fletcher visited Weisner and took footage of the Hollywood Casino of Aurora . In August , when Fletcher 's re @-@ election ad campaign began airing on television in Kentucky , journalists began calling Weisner 's office about the ads which used the footage as a backdrop for a message regarding the evils and temptations casinos bring into communities . The footage was included in the very first ads that Fletcher aired and the Kentucky press noted that Aurora City Hall was not pleased with the usage . One Kentucky journalist referred to the Aurora casino as the " unnamed villain " in Fletcher 's anti @-@ gambling ads . 
 One of Weisner 's major initiatives was to make Aurora the first city in Illinois to construct a complete wireless Internet infrastructure . In January 2008 while it was in the middle of installing the city 's wifi network , <unk> switched from an advertising @-@ based model to a subscription @-@ based business model and suspended construction . <unk> had also contracted to install a network for Naperville , Illinois and attempted to sell partially installed networks to both cities . In June 2008 , <unk> shut down all its wifi operations across the nation . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 As of the July 1 , 2007 United States Census Bureau population estimates , Aurora had a population of 170 @,@ 855 . Thus , Weisner served as mayor of a city ranked as the 135th largest incorporated municipality in the United States and the second largest in the state of Illinois . It is located 35 miles ( 56 @.@ 3 km ) west of the Loop in Chicago . 
 Under Mayor Weisner 's administration , the crime rate fell to a 32 @-@ year low and has been under the national average for 3 years . The City of Aurora has also developed a 21st @-@ century police station with an on @-@ site 911 operations center , county branch court , jail , and training center . The state of the art police station is utilizes green technologies to make it energy efficient and thus reducing energy costs . Part of those green technologies include solar panels and taking advantage of storm water run off to power the building . 
 Infrastructure improvements and cost saving measures 
 Mayor Weisner also worked with members of the City Council to insure that 108 miles of Aurora residential and arterial streets were surfaced . Traffic congestion was reduced with the completion of widening East Indian Trail from Farnsworth Ave to Mitchell Road . This project was completed with minimal cost to the city by obtaining a $ 6 million federal grant . Furthermore , under Mayor Weisner , the City of Aurora has made significant efforts in reducing the flooding that occurs when combined sewers lines back up . The City of Aurora also retrofitted several of its buildings , using stimulus funds , to be more energy efficient . The modifications are expected to cut down annual energy costs by 40 % . 
 Job creation 
 Peerless Industries moved to Aurora and established a 307 @,@ 813 @-@ square @-@ foot ( 28 @,@ 596 @.@ 8 m2 ) facility . Peerless Industries is one of the largest US @-@ based manufacturers of audio @-@ visual mounting solutions . They have operations in China , Mexico , and two facilities in Melrose Park , IL . Through the utilization of a TIF district , the popular Ballydoyle Irish Restaurant and Pub was able to open a second location within the city . In addition , the previous year , the creation of the Illinois Tollway interchange at <unk> Road on Interstate 88 created another avenue of access to Aurora for Chicago @-@ based commerce . The tollway is expected to bring an increased retail and restaurant presence to the city . This has been realized with the introduction of a Chick @-@ Fil @-@ a , Golden Corral , <unk> , and a Von Maur Dry Goods . In 2009 , 425 new jobs were added to the city with the introduction of the North American headquarters of Freudenberg Household Products . 
 Budget transparency 
 The City of Aurora , under Mayor Weisner , has also been the recipient of the Distinguished Budget Presentation Award from the Government Finance Officer 's Association . The award is given to municipalities that conduct their budget process in an open and reader friendly manner . Aurora last won the award in 2009 .

 = Round Hill , Brighton = 
 Round Hill ( sometimes spelt Roundhill ) is an inner suburban area of Brighton , part of the coastal city of Brighton and Hove in England . The area contains a mix of privately owned and privately rented terraced housing , much of which has been converted for multiple occupancy , and small @-@ scale commercial development . It was developed mostly in the late 19th century on an area of high land overlooking central Brighton , and with good views in all directions , the area became a desirable middle @-@ class suburb — particularly the large terraced houses of Roundhill Crescent and Richmond Road , and the exclusive Park Crescent — and within a few decades the whole of the hill had been built up with smaller terraces and some large villas . 
 Non @-@ residential buildings include the landmark St Martin 's Church , Brighton 's largest place of worship , with its dramatically extravagant interior ; the Brighton Forum , a Gothic Revival former college now in commercial use ; Brighton 's main fire station ; and the oldest working cinema in Britain . The first hospital in England catering for mental illness was established in a house in Roundhill Crescent in 1905 . Brighton 's first Jewish cemetery , although a short distance outside Round Hill according to Brighton & Hove City Council 's definition , has been associated with the suburb throughout its near 200 @-@ year history . The London Road viaduct , a distinctive , sweeping piece of railway architecture , forms the northern boundary of the area and " a literal gateway " between outer and inner suburbia . All of these buildings have been listed by English Heritage for their architectural and historical importance , and the core of Round Hill , around Roundhill Crescent , is one of 34 conservation areas in the city . Round Hill 's steep slopes and road layout encouraged the introduction of another feature which gives the area its character : the " cat 's @-@ creep " staircase . The area has good tree cover , and increasingly heavy traffic along the three main roads which run through the area . 
 Past features of Round Hill include a windmill , which took advantage of the windy conditions on the 223 @-@ foot ( 68 m ) hilltop until 1913 ; 19th @-@ century laundries , which sought the same advantage ; early 19th @-@ century pleasure gardens , now occupied by the houses of Park Crescent ; the landmark Cox 's Pill Factory , demolished in the 1980s ; glasshouses and smallholdings , some of which survived until after the Second World War despite being surrounded by houses ; and the Kemp Town branch line , a passenger and freight railway which cut through the area and had a short @-@ lived station serving Round Hill . The former St Saviour 's Church survived until 1983 , and a Congregational church elsewhere in the suburb closed but retained its façade after its conversion into housing . 
 = = Location = = 
 Round Hill is an approximately triangular area directly north of Brighton city centre . The name is now applied to a wider area than the 223 @-@ foot ( 68 m ) hill at its centre ; its boundaries are now defined as Union Road and The Level ( a large area of open ground ) to the south , the main London Road to the west , the East Coastway railway line to the north — including the London Road viaduct and London Road railway station — and the Lewes Road to the east . Ditchling Road , a third main road , runs through the centre of the suburb . The large , round @-@ topped hill which gave the suburb its name stands between the two main valleys along which the original routes into and out of Brighton developed ( the present London and Lewes Roads ) . Ditchling Road , the middle route , climbs the hill . London and Lewes Roads became turnpikes ( toll roads ) in 1770 , and The Level — originally common land between Ditchling Road and Lewes Road — was enclosed and reserved for public recreation in 1822 . 
 Round Hill 's elevated , fairly central position gives excellent inward and outward views . To the northeast , the South Downs can be seen ; long views of the English Channel are possible to the south , beyond the city centre and St Peter 's Church ; to the southeast , Elm Grove , Race Hill and Brighton General Hospital can be seen on high ground beyond the Lewes Road valley ; and to the west , Preston Park ( the city 's oldest and largest public park ) can be seen . Crescent and Wakefield Roads have long southward views towards the city centre , as do the small blocks of flats which replaced some large villas in the middle of the suburb . The tall viaduct is the main landmark to the west and north . There are clear views into Round Hill from many parts of Brighton , especially areas to the east and southeast such as Race Hill . 
 When the railway line was built between Brighton and Lewes in 1846 , the northern slope of Round Hill was effectively severed from the rest of the area . It developed separately as an industrial area and the site of many Brighton Corporation utilities : the Brighton Dust Destructor , an incinerator for rubbish , was built in 1866 , followed by another incinerator in 1898 ; the Municipal Abattoir was established in 1894 ; and in the early 20th century a meat market and a municipal cleansing station for the fumigation and delousing of people and property were built nearby . Although they occupy land that was part of the hill , these buildings were considered to be part of neighbouring Hollingdean . Residents of Round Hill , especially those who owned laundries , often complained about the smell and soot from the incinerators . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early history = = = 
 In 1800 , Round Hill was a steep @-@ sided , round @-@ topped hill rising to 223 feet ( 68 m ) and ploughed up for use by farmers . Some poorly defined tracks crossed it , linking Preston village to the road to Lewes . Two of the largest landowners in the Brighton and Hove area , Thomas Read Kemp and William Stanford ( an ancestor of Charles Thomas @-@ Stanford of the Thomas @-@ Stanford Baronetcy of Preston Manor ) , owned most of the land between them . In the late 19th century , the Stanford family sold some of their land — which almost completely encircled Brighton , Preston and Hove to the north — for housing development , and retained much of it to develop themselves . 
 The earliest development in the Round Hill area was Ireland 's Pleasure Gardens on the southern slope in 1823 . Also known as the Royal Pleasure Gardens , this venture by James Ireland was intended to be a profitable speculation , attracting the increasing number of visitors and short @-@ term residents who had doubled Brighton 's population in the previous decade . Ireland , a rich businessman with interests in drapery and undertaking , bought a 10 @-@ acre ( 4 ha ) site from Thomas Read Kemp in 1822 and opened the gardens on 1 May 1823 . The vast range of attractions included an aviary , maze , formal gardens with a canal , Gothic @-@ style tower , bowling greens , billiard rooms , assembly rooms with a roof promenade , a grotto and a lake . A cricket ground ( the Royal New Ground ) was also provided , and was said to be " the best in the country " at the time . Despite the range of activities , and occasional high @-@ profile stunts by associates of Ireland ( such as a flying demonstration ) , the gardens never thrived , and soon fell into decline . Ireland sold them in 1826 , and later owners presided over further decline until the facility was eventually closed in the 1840s . Only its south boundary wall and gate piers , decorated with copies of their original stone lions , survive . 
 Another development of the 1820s , on Thomas Read Kemp 's landholding , was the Jewish cemetery and its chapel . Its location on Florence Place , off Ditchling Road just north of the railway line , places it marginally outside Brighton and Hove City Council 's definition of the Round Hill area , but the site has always been associated with Round Hill . In 1826 , Kemp , who at the time was a member of parliament , donated a parcel of land on the north slope of the hill to the congregation of Brighton 's synagogue . The town had a large Jewish population — about 150 by 1840 . An octagonal brick cemetery chapel ( the Ohel ) , designed by the firm of Thomas Lainson and Son , was built in the burial ground in 1893 . In accordance with Jewish custom , it had facilities for mourners to wash their hands upon leaving the " presence of death " . Money to build the chapel and a fence round the cemetery was raised in the 1890s by charging members of the Middle Street Synagogue two shillings per week for a year ; some prominent members of Brighton 's Jewish community provided interest @-@ free loans as well . Burials include Henry Solomon , Brighton Borough 's chief constable ( murdered in 1844 ) ; Hyam Lewis , a Brighton Town Commissioner and the first Jew in England to hold such a high @-@ ranking municipal position ; Levi Emanuel Cohen , a radical journalist who helped Brighton achieve borough status ; and Sir John Howard , an engineer . The cemetery has been full for many years and is now closed except for family burials where a tomb already exists . It is locked and in poor condition ; many graves are overgrown . The foundation stone commemorating Kemp 's gift of the land survives , though . The cemetery chapel and its surrounding walls and gates are Grade II listed buildings . 
 In 1838 , a windmill was built at the top of the hill , where the northern end of the present @-@ day Belton Road stands . Although it was demolished in the early 20th century , it has been called " probably the most well @-@ known feature of the Round Hill area " . Its names included Rose Hill Mill , Round Hill Mill and <unk> 's Mill , but its most common name — alluding to the type of windmill it was — was Tower Mill . Ownership changed regularly , and the mill was rarely profitable — even after Charles <unk> converted it to steam power in 1880 . Storm damage soon afterwards caused further problems . The mill was demolished in 1913 , and its bricks were recovered and used in the construction of some houses in Belton Road . 
 In 1854 , the Diocese of Chichester selected an area of open land on the west side of Ditchling Road as the site of their Training College for Anglican <unk> , which had outgrown its premises in Black Lion Street in the old town . Viaduct Road was built in front of the Gothic Revival building 's south façade around the same time , and was built up with terraced houses by the early 1860s . In the early 20th century , the Diocese bought three of the four villas nearby and converted them into accommodation for trainee schoolteachers . Before that , the trainee teachers slept in large rooms in the Training College . 
 = = = Residential development in the 19th century = = = 
 Between 1838 and 1840 , the local Colbatch family built four large detached villas in the former Rose Hill Park on a southwest @-@ facing part of the hill . They were described as the " grandest and most ostentatious part of Round Hill " , and the first ( Rose Hill Villa , finished in 1838 ) was a " classic Victorian building " . All four were large family homes in the Regency style popular in Brighton over the previous 30 years . Iron gates , protected by gatekeepers who lived in three cottages in the grounds , gave the villas privacy . 
 The site of the failed Pleasure Gardens then became one of Brighton 's most exclusive residential developments in the 1850s , when prominent and influential local architect Amon Henry Wilds conceived and built the three @-@ part Park Crescent development . The horseshoe @-@ shaped terrace of 48 houses faced inwards towards a private garden formed from the old cricket ground . The " most ambitious scheme " of his long career was also one of his last : construction lasted from 1849 until 1854 , and he died in 1857 . 
 Contemporary housing developments included the southeast side of Upper Lewes Road , the west side of Lewes Road , and a series of impressive semi @-@ detached villas on Ditchling Road , but Round Hill 's most intensive period of growth began in the mid @-@ 1860s . " Fine curving terraces of Regency @-@ style houses " appeared on the newly built Roundhill Crescent , which curved away from the northwest side of Upper Lewes Road , and semi @-@ detached houses were laid out on Richmond Road behind and at a higher level . The first parts of Roundhill Crescent , still with a post @-@ Regency character despite their late date , were built in 1865 . Further development of the middle @-@ class houses on these roads was patchy — many gaps still existed in 1875 — but lower @-@ class terraced housing spread rapidly elsewhere . Vicar of Brighton Rev. Arthur Wagner bought the northern part of the former Pleasure Gardens — still open land in 1860 — and stipulated that houses costing no more than £ 120 should be built for Brighton 's working @-@ class population . He lent money to builders to increase the pace of development . The tightly packed terraced streets between Upper Lewes Road and Lewes Road were mostly complete by the 1870s , and St Martin 's Church was built nearby to serve the area . Larger individual houses of the 1860s included Prince 's Villa , in an isolated position next to Tower Mill , and Bryn — built in 1869 on Wakefield Road and used as an orphanage from 1875 until 1937 . 
 Another period of rapid residential development occurred in the 1880s . The gaps in Roundhill Crescent were filled with houses in a more contemporary style than the old @-@ fashioned Regency @-@ style houses of the 1860s . Several streets around Prince 's Road were built between 1880 and 1884 . Also in the 1880s , The Salvation Army founded a place of worship in the area . The citadel could hold 1 @,@ 400 people , and was located on Park Crescent Terrace behind the west side of Park Crescent . Nearby , the Royal Hippodrome ( unrelated to the Hippodrome in Brighton 's old town ) had opened on 31 October 1876 . The 1 @,@ 600 @-@ capacity building hosted a circus until 1889 , then reopened under new ownership on 28 July 1890 as the Gaiety Theatre and cinema . Never a success , it closed permanently in 1900 and passed into commercial use until its demolition for flats in 1930 . 
 = = = <unk> and cat 's @-@ creeps = = = 
 Despite this intensive building work , there were many gaps between houses and streets , and smallholdings and plant nurseries were common . Two existed in 1838 , including one where grapes were cultivated , and more were planted in the 1850s . When the houses of Prince 's Road were laid out , there were already two nurseries on it . A large nursery existed behind Park Crescent until 1883 , when the Salvation Army Citadel was built on the site . Other areas of green space survive behind Richmond Road , between Wakefield Road and Roundhill Crescent , and along the railway embankment east of Ditchling Road tunnel . Clearly visible from afar , these green spaces give the area a strong visual character and are important wildlife habitats . Another characteristic topographical feature of Round Hill is the " cat 's @-@ creep " , a type of steep , narrow staircase between buildings . Often found in Brighton 's hilly suburbs such as Moulsecoomb and Hollingbury , the best example is found between Roundhill Crescent and Richmond Road . Named Lennox Place , it was planned at the same time as the nearby Mayo , D 'Aubigny and Wakefield Roads , and was meant to be a proper street with houses . It was found to be too steep for horses and carts to negotiate , though , and it was laid out as a footpath with eight steep flights of 15 steps instead . It was a popular play area as well as a short @-@ cut . 
 = = = Employment and industry in the 19th and 20th centuries = = = 
 With its sunny , breezy slopes , wide open spaces and distance from the polluted town centre , Round Hill was ideally placed for the development of 19th @-@ century laundries . In many cases , these were small , home @-@ based businesses , but some larger premises also existed . The Brighton and Sussex Laundry Works catered for large institutions such as hotels and schools as well as for small orders , employed many local women , and had its own vans to transport washing around Brighton . Drying was carried out on a large area of open ground attached to the premises . Washing was also transported in and out by train via Lewes Road station , which was behind the building . This enabled work to be taken on from all parts of Sussex . Other long @-@ established businesses included the Northern , Tivoli , Primrose and Mayo <unk> ; and in the 1880s many houses in the newly built Prince 's and Richmond Roads were set up as small @-@ scale laundries , using their gardens for drying . For many years , the suburb was popularly known as " Laundry Hill " , and laundries were the main source of local employment ; but all trace of the industry disappeared by the 1980s . 
 Another important 20th @-@ century industry was Cox 's Pill Factory , which took over the Brighton and Sussex Laundry Works premises when that company moved to Hove in 1910 . Founded by Arthur Cox in 1839 at Ship Street in the old town , the manufacturing division moved to premises at St Martin 's Place in 1871 . Cox 's speciality was coating pills with a layer of sugar @-@ based material to hide their taste , for which he received a patent in 1854 . His sons bought the former laundry building on Lewes Road for £ 5 @,@ 500 in 1910 and converted it into a factory , adding a landmark clock to the façade . The building was ready in 1912 . Wartime government contracts augmented production for their regular customers , and the business thrived ; it only moved away from the Lewes Road site in 1979 because expansion and modernisation were required . No suitable sites could be found locally , and the company relocated to Barnstaple in Devon . Another factory , which produced golf balls and ( latterly ) rubber products , occupied one of the semi @-@ detached houses on Richmond Road from the 1920s until the 1980s .

 In 1905 , Round Hill became a national leader in the field of mental healthcare when the first hospital for the treatment of mental illness was opened in the large house at 101 Roundhill Crescent . It evolved from a dispensary founded in 1899 by Dr Helen Boyle in the nearby suburb of Hanover . Dr Boyle rented the house at Roundhill Crescent , moved the dispensary there and added a 12 @-@ bed hospital for the treatment of what were then termed " nervous disorders " . The Lewes Road Hospital for Women and Children was the first such facility in England : until then , people regarded as suffering from such disorders were sent to lunatic asylums . The hospital expanded in 1911 and moved to Ditchling Road , and later split into two parts housed in Brighton and the Brunswick Town area of Hove respectively . <unk> facilities at the institutions ceased only in 1988 . 
 Round Hill was at the centre of a health scare in 1950 – 51 . A smallpox epidemic broke out in Brighton in late December 1950 ; the family of the first sufferer were regular users of the Tivoli Laundry on Crescent Road , and many employees were infected by the soiled linen . Two died , but rapid work by Brighton Corporation 's health department prevented the outbreak spreading beyond Brighton .

 The villas erected by the Colbatch family were demolished after the Second World War . The family , which still owned the buildings and the land , drew up plans to replace the four villas and the gatekeepers ' cottages with flats . These were intended for private ownership ; but council housing was so scarce in Brighton at the time ( 1945 ) that Brighton Borough Council bought the land using a compulsory purchase order and redeveloped it with council flats based on the family 's designs . The new flats , built in the early 1950s , were large and well @-@ built , and the old gardens were retained . At first , no young children were allowed to live there , and only higher earning council tenants could apply . 
 The closure of Cox 's Pill Factory , the Kemp Town branch line and the nearby Vogue cinema in the 1970s and early 1980s prompted large @-@ scale redevelopment . Between 1983 and 1985 , a large area around the junction of Lewes and Upper Lewes Roads was cleared in favour of the Vogue Gyratory system and a Sainsbury 's supermarket . The Vogue Gyratory , a major road junction connecting Upper Lewes Road , Lewes Road , Bear Road and Hollingdean Road , opened in mid @-@ 1984 . Sainsbury 's was completed and opened on 23 April 1985 ; its design featured round @-@ arched exterior arcades which recalled the recently demolished viaduct , and the clock was retrieved from the demolished pill factory and reset on the exterior of the new building . It won Brighton Council 's design award in 1985 . 
 On the Lewes Road station site at the junction of Richmond Road and D 'Aubigny Road stands Richmond House , a disused office block . In February 2013 , a developer applied for planning permission to demolish the building and replace it with student housing consisting of 144 flats .

 Many buildings in the Round Hill area have been listed by English Heritage . A building or structure is defined as " listed " when it is placed on a statutory register of buildings of " special architectural or historic interest " by the Secretary of State for Culture , Media and Sport , a Government department . Grade I @-@ listed buildings are defined as being of " exceptional interest " and greater than national importance ; Grade II * , the next highest status , is used for " particularly important buildings of more than special interest " ; and the lowest grade , Grade II , is used for " nationally important buildings of special interest " .

 Vicar of Brighton Rev. Arthur Wagner , who established a mission chapel in an old school building in 1867 , planned to build a permanent church to serve the Round Hill area . St Martin 's Church was built between 1872 and 1875 as a memorial to Wagner 's father ( and predecessor as Vicar of Brighton ) Rev. Henry Michell Wagner , who died in 1870 . The church was very large , reflecting the density of housing in Round Hill and its proximity to Preston Barracks , where many soldiers were based . This also influenced its dedication — to Martin of Tours , the patron saint of soldiers . Up to 1 @,@ 500 worshippers could be accommodated in the vast , cathedral @-@ like interior . George Somers Leigh Clarke 's plain , " almost ruthless " exterior , of red and yellow brick in the Early English Gothic Revival style , contrasts with the " breathtaking magnificence " of the interior , whose fixtures and decoration were planned by Clarke and designed to his specifications . It is one of 69 Grade II * listed buildings in Brighton and Hove . 
 A small chapel , opened by the Railway Mission in 1876 but now with an Evangelical congregation , is adjacent to the fire station on Viaduct Road . James Barnes 's Gothic Revival building has three lancet windows on the façade and projecting entrances which resemble porches . There is decorative machicolation on the parapet . 
 Catherine Booth , wife of the founder of The Salvation Army William Booth , opened a large Salvation Army citadel behind Park Crescent in March 1884 . Designed and built of red brick and terracotta in 1883 by E.J. Hamilton , it could hold 1 @,@ 400 people and had castellated towers at the corners . It was extended in 1925 , but in 2000 it was demolished and replaced with a smaller octagonal Congress Hall designed by David Greenwood . Its design recalls some of the features of the Park Crescent houses opposite . 
 St Saviour 's Church served the southwestern part of Round Hill until 1981 . The flint and brick building , set below the level of Ditchling Road and on its west side , was in the Early English Gothic Revival style and was meant to have a tower ; only a stub was ever built . The architects were Edmund Scott and F.T. Cawthorn . An extension was built in 1889 , and in 1904 a large reredos designed by Richard Herbert Carpenter and W. Slater was moved to the church from Chichester Cathedral . Congregations declined , and the church was demolished in 1983 ; flats called St Saviour 's Court and a rear archway in Vere Road recall its existence . 
 At the north end of the suburb , the Lewes Road Congregational Church was built in 1872 . A. Harford 's design has been described as Italianate Gothic . The congregation joined the United Reformed Church , but the church closed in 1993 and the building was sold for redevelopment . The congregation moved to a new building , and the flats of Stanley Court were built behind the old façade . 
 The cemetery chapel ( Ohel ) at the Jewish burial ground is Grade II @-@ listed . Designed in 1893 by Lainson and Son and built by the Garrett building firm , it is a red @-@ brick octagonal structure in the Queen Anne style , with a tiled turreted roof and corbel @-@ topped piers at each corner , a pedimented entrance and arched windows set below recessed panels . The burial ground is surrounded by walls , stucco @-@ faced gate piers and wrought iron fences which are listed separately at Grade II .

 The building now called Brighton Forum , at the junction of Ditchling and Viaduct Roads , forms a local landmark . The Grade II @-@ listed knapped flint Gothic Revival structure , designed by William and Edward Habershon , was built in 1854 on open land at the northern boundary of Brighton Borough as the Diocese of Chichester 's training college for Anglican <unk> . It was extended to the north in 1886 , and was used as a training college until the Second World War , when the Royal Engineers requisitioned it and used it to store their records and archives . After its closure in 1987 , it was briefly threatened with demolition , but in 1988 it was converted into serviced offices under the name Brighton Business Centre ( later Brighton Forum ) . 
 Standing next to each other at Preston Circus , at the northwest edge of the suburb , are the Duke of York 's Picture House and Brighton 's main fire station . The cinema opened on 22 September 1910 , making it one of the first in the world , and it is still operational as England 's oldest working cinema . The Clayton & Black firm 's ornate Baroque @-@ style building , with a three @-@ bay façade defined by paired pilasters with rustication , cost £ 3 @,@ 000 . The fire station , designed in a " restrained Modernist " style by Graeme <unk> in 1938 , curves round the road and features carved motifs by Joseph Cribb . Its materials are brown brick and Portland stone . 
 The former Tower Mill stood at the top of Round Hill between 1838 and 1913 . Built of about 50 @,@ 000 bricks , and with walls with a maximum thickness of 2 feet ( 0 @.@ 61 m ) , it rose to 60 feet ( 18 m ) and was topped with a copper dome . The four sails were about 32 feet ( 9 @.@ 8 m ) long and were attached to a walnut wood rotating roof . 
 = = Transport = = 
 The East Coastway Line , a railway line currently operated by Southern , forms Round Hill 's northern boundary . London Road station , situated in a cutting between London Road and Ditchling Road , serves the area . Situated 3 ⁄ 4 mile ( 1 @.@ 2 km ) from Brighton station , it opened on 1 October 1877 and retains its substantial ticket office building . The 400 @-@ yard ( 370 m ) , 27 @-@ arch London Road viaduct ( built in 1846 ) rises to 67 feet ( 20 m ) above the London Road valley immediately west of the station , separating the Round Hill suburb from neighbouring Preston . A 63 @-@ yard ( 58 m ) tunnel then takes the line under Ditchling Road . 
 Immediately beyond the tunnel was Kemp Town Junction , where the Kemp Town branch line diverged . The first station to serve Round Hill was on this route , which " cut through the area and created a new artery " upon its opening on 2 August 1869 . A three @-@ platform station called Lewes Road opened on 1 September 1873 at the north end of D 'Aubigny Road . The line was expensive to build and maintain : it crossed Lewes Road on a 52 @-@ foot ( 16 m ) -high , 180 @-@ yard ( 160 m ) -long viaduct , and beyond Round Hill there was another short viaduct and a long tunnel . Passenger services at Lewes Road station ceased on 31 December 1932 , but coal trains continued to use its six @-@ siding goods yard . The line closed completely on 14 June 1971 , and the Lewes Road viaduct was demolished in part in 1976 and completely in 1983 . 
 The main reason for the Kemp Town branch line 's decline was the increasing popularity of buses . The three main roads running through Round Hill — London Road , Ditchling Road and Lewes Road — are used by many regular routes , mainly operated by the Brighton & Hove Bus and Coach Company . Routes 26 , 46 and 50 , which serve Hollingbury and Hollingdean northbound and Brighton city centre , Hove and Southwick southbound , run via Ditchling Road . Routes along London Road include the 5 ( Patcham to <unk> ) and 56 ( Patcham to the Knoll Estate in Hove ) . Along Lewes Road , regular routes include 21 , 23 , 24 , 25 , 28 , 29 , 38 and 49 , serving places such as Sussex and Brighton Universities , Hove , Lewes , Uckfield , Tunbridge Wells , Moulsecoomb , <unk> and Queen 's Park . Several other routes use Union Road , the southern boundary of the Round Hill area . 
 Some bus services are based on old tram routes operated by Brighton Corporation Tramways between 1901 and 1939 , and their trolleybus successors . The Corporation ran eight tram routes , mostly from Brighton Aquarium , to various parts of Brighton . Routes B and D ( a pair of circular services between the Aquarium and Beaconsfield Villas / Ditchling Road ) used Ditchling and London Roads , and route L ( Aquarium to Moulsecoomb ) travelled along Lewes Road . Some routes also used tracks on Viaduct Road . The system 's only fatal accident occurred in 1935 in Round Hill when a tram skidded outside the Diocesan Training College and hit a cyclist . 
 The three main roads — and Upper Lewes Road , which runs between the Ditchling and Lewes Roads — experience heavy traffic , but little through traffic uses the smaller residential streets such as Roundhill Crescent . Traffic calming measures installed in 2003 have acted as a deterrent . There are high levels of on @-@ street car parking , though . Union Road and the Vogue Gyratory are also high @-@ traffic routes . The Gyratory , " a fiendish maze of one @-@ way systems , roundabouts and crossings " , is the point at which Upper Lewes Road and Lewes Road meet two other routes . Named after the Vogue — latterly a pornographic cinema — it was built in 1983 – 84 on the site of the former Lewes Road viaduct , Cox 's Pill Factory and surrounding buildings in connection with a Sainsbury 's supermarket development . Demolition of the entire complex of roads was already being advocated in 2007 . 
 = = Conservation area = = 
 On 6 January 1977 , 29 @.@ 78 acres ( 12 @.@ 05 ha ) at the heart of Round Hill was designated as a conservation area ; as of 2016 it is one of 34 such areas in the city of Brighton and Hove . Its boundaries are ( clockwise from north ) Prince 's Road , Mayo Road , D 'Aubigny Road , Roundhill Crescent , Upper Lewes Road , Wakefield Road , Prince 's Crescent and Ditchling Road . This area includes all the Grade II @-@ listed houses of Roundhill Crescent ( described by Brighton and Hove City Council as " the most important architecturally " ) , two pubs ( including the Tudor Revival @-@ style New Vic , built in the 1920s and representing a late addition to the mostly late 19th @-@ century streetscape ) , and four paired semi @-@ detached villas on Ditchling Road which were some of the earliest houses in the area — they date from about 1850 . 
 The area 's character derives from its " tight urban form " and lack of 20th @-@ century redevelopment , resulting in a homogeneous streetscape of mostly residential buildings in long terraces ; its steeply sloping land ; and the swathes of trees and gardens which can be seen in long views into the area , which help to " define the unaltered Victorian <unk> " when seen from a distance . Roundhill Crescent " both curves and changes height dramatically along its length " . The houses , which on the northwest side of the road are not a continuous terrace and which date from the 1860s to the 1880s , vary in height and the extent of their architectural detailing ; canted bay windows and original cast @-@ iron balconies feature prominently . Some pairs of semi @-@ detached villas of the 1860s survive on Richmond Road . Prince 's Road , where the 223 @-@ foot ( 68 m ) summit of Round Hill is located , has a long , well @-@ defined frontage of rendered terraced houses dating from the 1880s , with an older flint and brick house with decorative bargeboards and gables breaking up the composition . 
 Building materials vary greatly . Brick was rarely used at the time Round Hill was developing ( although a few houses in Belton Road were built of it ) ; <unk> was often used for walls instead . Characteristic of Brighton but almost unknown elsewhere , this consisted of random assortments of materials such as low @-@ quality brick , cobbles , flints , pebbles , rubble , wood and sand , set in hydraulic lime and shuttered . <unk> was often faced with render or stucco to make it weatherproof . Some flint buildings survive on Prince 's Crescent . When built , most windows in the conservation area 's houses were sashes , and roofs were of Welsh slate . 
 The area retains many original boundary walls , often in brick and flint or cast iron . Some pavements were laid with blue @-@ brick paving slabs , and a few survive . Elsewhere , granite kerbstones , stone @-@ dressed gutters and road crossing points laid with limestone and brick remain from the 19th @-@ century development of the area , and some cast @-@ iron lamp @-@ posts have survived .

 = K Foundation = 
 The K Foundation was an art foundation set up by Bill Drummond and Jimmy Cauty ( The KLF ) in 1993 , following their ' retirement ' from the music industry . The Foundation served as an artistic outlet for the duo 's post @-@ retirement KLF income . Between 1993 and 1995 , they spent this money in a number of ways , including on a series of Situationist @-@ inspired press adverts and extravagant subversions in the art world , focusing in particular on the Turner Prize . Most notoriously , when their plans to use banknotes as part of a work of art fell through , they burned a million pounds in cash . 
 The K Foundation announced a 23 @-@ year moratorium on all projects from November 1995 . They further indicated that they would not speak about the burning of the million pounds during the period of this moratorium . 
 = = Context = = 
 In the early 1980s , British musician and artist Jimmy Cauty was the guitarist in an underachieving pop / rock band , Brilliant . Brilliant had been signed to WEA Records by A & R man Bill Drummond , formerly a member of the Liverpool group Big in Japan , the manager of The Teardrop Explodes and Echo & the Bunnymen , and co @-@ founder of the independent record label Zoo Records . In 1986 , Brilliant released their one and only album - Kiss The Lips Of Life - before splitting up . In the same year , Drummond left WEA Records to record a solo album . Whilst out walking on New Year 's Day , 1987 , Drummond hit upon an idea for a hip @-@ hop record but , he said , knowing " nothing , personally , about the technology " , he needed a collaborator . Drummond called Jimmy Cauty who agreed to join him in a new band called The Justified Ancients of Mu @-@ Mu ( The JAMs ) . 
 The JAMs ' debut release , the single " All You Need Is Love " , was released as an underground white label on 9 March 1987 . By 1991 , the duo — now calling themselves The KLF — had become the best @-@ selling singles band in the world and , according to the Allmusic , were " on the verge of becoming superstars " . Instead , in May 1992 they machine @-@ gunned a music industry audience at the BRIT Awards ( albeit with blanks ) and quit the music business . 
 By their own account , neither Drummond nor Cauty kept any of the money that they made as The KLF ; it was all ploughed back into their extravagant productions . Cauty told an Australian Big Issue writer in 2003 that all the money they made as The KLF was spent , and that the royalties they accrued post @-@ retirement amounted to approximately one million pounds : 
 Although the duo had deleted their back catalogue in the UK with immediate effect , international licensees retained the contractual right to distribute KLF recordings for a number of years . The KLF , like any other artist , were also entitled to Performing Right Society royalties every time one of their songs was played on the radio or television . Rather than spend these earnings or invest them for personal gain , the duo decided the money would be used to fund a new art foundation - The K Foundation . " Having created an artistic machine that created money " , said GQ Magazine , " they [ then ] invented a machine for destroying it . " Quite what the Foundation , this money @-@ destroying machine , would do with the million pounds plus was still undecided . 
 Music journalist Sarah Champion pointed out ( prior to the million pound fire ) that , " Being ' in the money ' doesn 't mean they 'll ever be rich . [ Drummond and Cauty will ] always be skint , but their pranks will get more extravagant . If they earned £ 10 million , they 'd blow it all by buying Jura or a fleet of K Foundation airships or a Van Gogh to be ceremonially burned . " " There are things we 'd like to do which we haven 't done . " , Drummond told a journalist in 1991 . " Totally ludicrous things . We want to buy ships , have submarines . They really are stupid things I know , but I feel confident that in the event of us selling ten million albums we would definitely go out and buy a submarine .... Just to be able to say ' Look we 've got a submarine and 808 State haven 't ' . " 
 = = K Foundation adverts = = 
 The first manifestation of the K Foundation was a series of adverts in UK national newspapers in 1993 . The first adverts , in July 1993 , were cryptic , referring to " K Time " and advising readers to " Kick out the clocks " . There was also an advert for their single " K Cera Cera " which was " Available nowhere ... no formats " and which was not planned for release until world peace was established . The single was eventually released , but only in Israel . 
 " When the first in a strange series of full @-@ page ads appeared in The Independent on July 4 " , said The Face , " people started whispering . The cultish rhetoric , the unfathomable " Divide and Kreate " slogans , the K symbols , all suggested that the kings of cultural anarchy were back . " Each advert cost between £ 5 @,@ 000 and £ 15 @,@ 000 . 
 = = Turner Prize subversion = = 
 The 1994 K Foundation award was an award given by the K Foundation to the " worst artist of the year " . The Foundation commissioned more press adverts , instructing readers to " Abandon all art now " and then inviting them to vote for the worst artist of the year . The 1993 Turner Prize was being judged at the same time , and , perhaps not coincidentally , both awards had the same shortlist of four artists . The prize being offered by Drummond and Cauty was £ 40 @,@ 000 which was double the £ 20 @,@ 000 offered for the Turner Prize . 
 Channel 4 Television broadcast coverage of the Turner Prize , during which three more K Foundation adverts were broadcast — these announced the " amending of art history " . During the evening , Rachel Whiteread was announced as the winner of both the Turner Prize and the K Foundation award . Whiteread initially refused to accept the K Foundation prize , but after being told that the money would be incinerated , she reluctantly accepted , with the intention of donating £ 30 @,@ 000 to artists in financial need and the other £ 10 @,@ 000 to the housing charity , Shelter . 
 = = Money : A Major Body Of Cash = = 
 During the buildup to the presentation of the K Foundation art award to Rachel Whiteread on 23 November 1993 , the K Foundation presented their first artwork to the press . Nailed To A Wall , " the first of a series of K Foundation art installations that will also include one million pounds in a skip , one million pounds on a table and several variants on the theme of Tremendous Amounts Of Folding " , consisted of one million pounds in £ 50 notes , nailed to a large framed board . Nailed To A Wall had a reserve price of £ 500 @,@ 000 , half the face value of the cash used in its construction , which Scotland on Sunday 's reporter Robert Dawson Scott was " fairly confident ... really was £ 1 million [ in cash ] " . The catalogue entry for the artwork stated : " Over the years the face value will be eroded by inflation , while the artistic value will rise and rise . The precise point at which the artistic value will overtake the face value is unknown . <unk> the work now and you double your money . Hang it on a wall and watch the face value erode , the market value fluctuate , and the artistic value soar . The choice is yours . " 
 Collectively , the K Foundation 's money @-@ as @-@ art works were titled Money : A Major Body Of Cash , " seven pieces , all involving various amounts of cash nailed to , tied to or simply standing on inanimate objects " . The Face magazine neatly summed up the concepts behind the art project : 
 During the first half of 1994 , the K Foundation attempted to interest galleries in staging Money : A Major Body Of Cash . However , even old friend Jayne Casey , director of the Liverpool Festival Trust , was unable to persuade a major gallery to participate . " ' The Tate , in Liverpool , wanted to be part of the 21st Century Festival I 'm involved with , ' says Casey . ' I suggested they put on the K Foundation exhibition ; at first they were encouraging , but they seemed nervous about the personalities involved . ' A curt fax from ... the gallery curator , informed Casey that the K Foundation 's exhibition of money had been done before and more interestingly " , leaving Drummond and Cauty obliged to pursue other options . The duo considered taking the exhibition across the former Soviet Union by train and on to the United States , but no insurer would touch the project . Then an exhibition at Dublin 's Kilmainham Jail was considered . No sooner had a provisional date of August been set for the exhibition , however , when the duo changed their minds yet again . " Jimmy said : ' Why don 't we just burn it ? ' remembers Drummond . ' He said it in a light @-@ hearted way , I suppose , hoping I 'd say : ' No , we can 't do that , let 's do this ... ' But it seemed the most powerful thing to do . " Cauty : " We were just sitting in a cafe talking about what we were going to spend the money on and then we decided it would be better if we burned it . That was about six weeks before we did it . It was too long , it was a bit of a nightmare . " 
 = = The K Foundation Burn A Million Quid = = 
 On 23 August 1994 , in a boathouse on the Scottish island of Jura , Drummond and Cauty incinerated £ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 in cash . The burning was witnessed by an old friend of Drummond 's , freelance journalist Jim Reid , who subsequently wrote an article about the ceremony for The Observer . It was filmed on Super 8 by their friend Gimpo . 
 Reid admitted to first feeling shock and guilt about the burning , which quickly turned to boredom . The money took well over an hour to burn as Drummond and Cauty fed £ 50 notes into the fire . Drummond later said that only about £ 900 @,@ 000 of the money was actually burnt – the rest flew straight up the chimney . The press reported that an islander handed £ 1 @,@ 500 into the police ; the money had not been claimed and would be returned to the finder . 
 On 23 August 1995 , exactly one year after the burning , Drummond and Cauty returned to Jura for the premier screening of the film , now known as Watch the K Foundation Burn a Million Quid . The film was then toured around the UK over the next few months ( plus one showing in Belgrade ) , with a Q & A session at the end of each screening where members of the audience asked Drummond and Cauty why they burnt the money and also offered their own interpretations . 
 = = Moratorium = = 
 Drummond and Cauty announced a moratorium on K Foundation activities in the obscure " Workshop For A Non @-@ Linear Architecture " bulletin of November 1995 . The duo had signed a " contract " , agreeing to wind up the K Foundation and not to speak about the money burning for a period of 23 years . The document was signed on the bonnet of a rented car which , they claim , they then pushed over the cliffs at Cape Wrath . This was followed on 8 December 1995 by an advertisement in The Guardian : 
 In November 1995 , the BBC aired an edition of the Omnibus documentary series about The K Foundation entitled " A Foundation Course in Art " . 
 The final act of the K Foundation was distributing a van load of Tennent 's Super - a high @-@ alcohol @-@ content lager - to London 's street drinkers on Christmas Day 1995 . However , the Foundation discovered that their choice of location for this endeavour — near Waterloo Station on the South Bank — was unusually devoid of homeless people , many of whom were in homeless shelters for the day . " That was a pity " , said Jimmy Cauty . " If you are down @-@ and @-@ out , would you rather have a bowl of soup or a can of Tennent 's ? " The Sunday Times later called the scheme " ethically dubious " . 
 Drummond and Cauty would next work together in 1997 , when they attempted to " Fuck the Millennium " as 2K ( music ) and K2 Plant Hire ( conceptual art ) . 
 = = K Cera Cera and The Magnificent = = 
 The only music release to bear the name of the K Foundation was " K Cera Cera " , released as a limited edition single in Israel and Palestine in November 1993 . An amalgam of " Que Sera , Sera ( Whatever Will Be , Will Be ) " and John Lennon / Yoko Ono 's " Happy Xmas ( War Is Over ) " , it was credited to the " K Foundation presents The Red Army Choir " . Originally intended for release when " world peace [ is ] established " ( i.e. never ) and in " no formats " , the Israeli release was made " In acknowledgement of the recent brave steps taken by the Israeli Government and the Palestinian Liberation Organisation ( PLO ) " . Said Drummond : " Our idea was to create awareness of peace in the world . Because we were worried it would be interpreted by the public as an attempt by The KLF to return to the music world on the back of a humanist gimmick , we decided to hide behind the Foundation . " 
 Also made by the duo during the K Foundation 's existence , reported by the NME as a K Foundation work , but officially attributed to " The One World Orchestra featuring The Massed Pipes and Drums of the Children 's Free Revolutionary Volunteer Guards " , was " The Magnificent " , their contribution to the charity album Help . The song , a drum 'n'bass version of the theme tune from The Magnificent Seven with vocal samples from DJ <unk> of Serbian radio station B92 , was recorded on 4 September 1995 . On 5 September 1995 , Drummond and Cauty claimed they would " never make any more records " . Drummond said , " What do you expect us to do , go and make a jungle record ? " ; Cauty added " Yeah , like a jungle novelty record with some strings on it or something . It would just be sad wouldn 't it ? We 're too old . " NME gleefully informed their readers , " The K Foundation 's contribution to the ' Help ' LP is a jungle track . " Help was released on 9 September 1995 .

The facilities provided by the park include an extensive network of backcountry trails for hiking and backpacking , rustic <unk> cabins , modern campgrounds , swimming and boating areas , and various interpretive programs led by park rangers . The North Country Trail passes through the park . In the winter , a ski area also operates within the park . Because of the copper mining history of the park , it is a cooperating unit of Keweenaw National Historical Park .

 The routing of M @-@ 107 had been largely unchanged since designation . The designation was created in 1935 as a tribute to the 107th Engineer Combat Battalion . The highway was dedicated on June 13 , 1954 to the battalion at a ceremony by Highway Commissioner Charles M. Ziegler . This ceremony was attended by approximately 1 @,@ 200 people at a highway turnout located along the roadway 4 miles ( 6 km ) west of Silver City . A 3 @-@ short @-@ ton ( 2 @.@ 7 t ) boulder was placed on a concrete pedestal with a bronze inscription plaque at the location of the ceremony . The Michigan Legislature named M @-@ 107 the " 107th Engineer Memorial Road " in 2001 . 
 On June 4 , 2008 , a transfer agreement was reached transferring the jurisdiction of M @-@ 107 from MDOT to the Ontonagon County Road Commission . This transfer marked the end of the M @-@ 107 designation as the roadway became a county primary road . The <unk> has named it the " 107th Engineers Memorial Highway " .

 = Ching Johnson = 
 Ivan Wilfred " Ching " Johnson ( December 7 , 1898 – June 16 , 1979 ) was a Canadian professional ice hockey defenceman who played for the New York Rangers and New York Americans in the National Hockey League ( NHL ) . He was an original member of the Rangers and was part of two Stanley Cup championship winning teams . He was named to the NHL 's post @-@ season all @-@ star team four times and played in the Ace Bailey Benefit Game , the first all @-@ star game in league history . 
 A veteran of World War I , Johnson did not begin playing competitive hockey until he was in his 20s and was nearly 30 when he first broke into the NHL . Regarded as one of the hardest <unk> to ever play the game , he was a fan favourite and went on to play 436 games with the Rangers and Americans before spending his final seasons in the minor leagues as a player , coach and official . Johnson was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1958 , and is also a member of the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame and Museum and the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Johnson was born in Winnipeg , Manitoba on December 7 , 1898 . He was an accomplished football and lacrosse player in his youth . He joined the Canadian Expeditionary Force in 1916 and fought for three years in the trenches of France as part of a mortar outfit . Johnson returned to Winnipeg following the war and worked for an electric light company . He first played competitive hockey in 1919 when he joined the Winnipeg Monarchs of the Winnipeg Senior Hockey League . He played two seasons with the Monarchs before moving to Eveleth , Minnesota where he joined the local team to play three seasons in the United States Amateur Hockey Association ( <unk> ) . He then played three seasons in Minneapolis , concluding in 1925 – 26 with the Minneapolis Millers . He was named a league all @-@ star on defence in both 1924 and 1926 . 
 First nicknamed " Ivan the Terrible " , Johnson later earned the nickname " Ching " when fans of the defencemen would shout " Ching , Ching Chinaman " to support him . Though he was of Irish descent , he was called " Chinaman " , then " Chink " and finally " Ching " as he was considered to have an Asian looking face . His physical style of defence made him immensely popular with fans , and he was often seen with a wide grin any time he made or received contact during a game . 
 = = National Hockey League career = = 
 It was from Minneapolis that Johnson was recruited , along with his defensive partner Taffy Abel , to play for the newly formed New York Rangers . Offered the position at the age of 28 , Johnson insisted on a three @-@ year contract as he believed it would be the only one he would get . He made his NHL debut in the Rangers opening game on November 16 , 1926 in a 1 – 0 victory over the Montreal Maroons . A rugged and physical defenceman , Johnson appeared in only 27 of the Rangers ' 44 games as he suffered a broken collar bone early in the season , but still finished second on the Rangers with 66 penalties in minutes . In 1927 – 28 , his total of 146 penalty minutes led the team and was second in the NHL to Eddie Shore 's 165 . He added a career high 10 goals , and helped the Rangers win their first Stanley Cup . Additionally , he was voted by the fans as the most valuable player of either New York team . 
 Johnson was lost to the Rangers early in the 1928 – 29 season when he suffered a broken ankle during a December game against the Maroons . A couple days after his injury , he had to be rescued when a fire threatened the Montreal hospital he was convalescing at . Johnson missed virtually the entire regular season with the injury , but returned in time for the 1929 playoffs , and was credited with improving the Rangers ' play as they reached the final against the Boston Bruins . 
 His contract having expired following the season , Johnson was a hold @-@ out when the Rangers opened their training camp prior to the 1929 – 30 NHL season as the team was reluctant to meet his demands for increased pay . When the impasse dragged into November , he threatened to quit the game altogether , before finally agreeing to a new three @-@ year deal . He appeared in 30 games for the Rangers that season , but again missed significant time , this time suffering a broken jaw . Again , Johnson returned in time for the playoffs , but was forced to wear a steel mask to protect his face . 
 Johnson remained healthy in 1930 – 31 , appearing in 44 games and was named to the league 's Second All @-@ Star Team on defence . In addition to being named to the First All @-@ Star Team in 1931 – 32 , Johnson finished just one vote behind Howie Morenz for the Hart Trophy as the league 's most valuable player . He was again named to the First All @-@ Star Team in 1932 – 33 and led the Rangers to their second Stanley Cup ; his defensive play was credited as being key to the team 's success . 
 In 1933 – 34 , Johnson earned his fourth consecutive post @-@ season all @-@ star nod , on the second team . He also participated in the first all @-@ star game in NHL history as the league held a benefit game to raise money for Toronto 's Ace Bailey , whose career was ended by a violent hit early in the season . Johnson contemplated retirement following that season as he again found himself in a dispute with the Rangers on a new contract , but signed prior to the season 's start . His season was again reduced by injury in 1934 – 35 but he returned in time for the playoffs . 
 Prior to the 1936 – 37 season , the Rangers signed Johnson to serve as the defensive coach while he continued to play . He appeared in 35 games but scored no points . Seeing little playing time , and having an offer to coach a minor league team , Johnson requested that the Rangers give him his outright release following the season . Believing that he had become too slow to play , the team agreed . He subsequently signed with the New York Americans , with whom he played one final NHL season in 1937 – 38 . 
 = = Post @-@ NHL career = = 
 At age 40 , Johnson returned to the Minneapolis Millers as a player @-@ coach for the 1938 – 39 season . He quickly became the American Hockey Association 's most popular star as large crowds attended games he participated in , and was named an AHA all @-@ star in 1939 . He served in the dual role for two years before resigning in 1940 . Johnson then coached for a time in California , before returning east to coach the Washington Lions of the American Hockey League . He also served as an official in the Eastern Hockey League . During one game in 1944 in which he was working as a linesman , Johnson forgot he was no longer playing and threw a bodycheck on a player . When asked after the game about the incident , he stated it was " instinct " that led him to throw the hit . 
 In recognition of his career , Johnson was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame as a player in 1958 . He was also inducted into the Manitoba Sports Hall of Fame and Museum in 1994 , and is an honoured member of the Manitoba Hockey Hall of Fame . The latter hall named him to province 's all @-@ century second all @-@ star team . 
 After leaving hockey , Johnson worked construction in Washington , D.C. , and later retired to the nearby community of Silver Spring , Maryland . He and his wife Ellen had two children : Geraldine and James . He had four grandchildren and one great @-@ grandchild at the time of his death in 1979 .

 = DNA nanotechnology = 
 DNA nanotechnology is the design and manufacture of artificial nucleic acid structures for technological uses . In this field , nucleic acids are used as non @-@ biological engineering materials for nanotechnology rather than as the carriers of genetic information in living cells . Researchers in the field have created static structures such as two- and three @-@ dimensional crystal lattices , nanotubes , polyhedra , and arbitrary shapes , as well as functional devices such as molecular machines and DNA computers . The field is beginning to be used as a tool to solve basic science problems in structural biology and biophysics , including applications in crystallography and spectroscopy for protein structure determination . Potential applications in molecular scale electronics and <unk> are also being investigated . 
 The conceptual foundation for DNA nanotechnology was first laid out by Nadrian Seeman in the early 1980s , and the field began to attract widespread interest in the mid @-@ 2000s . This use of nucleic acids is enabled by their strict base pairing rules , which cause only portions of strands with complementary base sequences to bind together to form strong , rigid double helix structures . This allows for the rational design of base sequences that will selectively assemble to form complex target structures with precisely controlled nanoscale features . A number of assembly methods are used to make these structures , including tile @-@ based structures that assemble from smaller structures , folding structures using the DNA origami method , and dynamically reconfigurable structures using strand displacement techniques . While the field 's name specifically references DNA , the same principles have been used with other types of nucleic acids as well , leading to the occasional use of the alternative name nucleic acid nanotechnology . 
 = = Fundamental concepts = = 
 = = = Properties of nucleic acids = = = 
 Nanotechnology is often defined as the study of materials and devices with features on a scale below 100 nanometers . DNA nanotechnology , specifically , is an example of bottom @-@ up molecular self @-@ assembly , in which molecular components spontaneously organize into stable structures ; the particular form of these structures is induced by the physical and chemical properties of the components selected by the designers . In DNA nanotechnology , the component materials are strands of nucleic acids such as DNA ; these strands are often synthetic and are almost always used outside the context of a living cell . DNA is well @-@ suited to nanoscale construction because the binding between two nucleic acid strands depends on simple base pairing rules which are well understood , and form the specific nanoscale structure of the nucleic acid double helix . These qualities make the assembly of nucleic acid structures easy to control through nucleic acid design . This property is absent in other materials used in nanotechnology , including proteins , for which protein design is very difficult , and nanoparticles , which lack the capability for specific assembly on their own . 
 The structure of a nucleic acid molecule consists of a sequence of nucleotides distinguished by which nucleobase they contain . In DNA , the four bases present are adenine ( A ) , cytosine ( C ) , guanine ( G ) , and thymine ( T ) . Nucleic acids have the property that two molecules will only bind to each other to form a double helix if the two sequences are complementary , meaning that they form matching sequences of base pairs , with A only binding to T , and C only to G. Because the formation of correctly matched base pairs is energetically favorable , nucleic acid strands are expected in most cases to bind to each other in the conformation that maximizes the number of correctly paired bases . The sequences of bases in a system of strands thus determine the pattern of binding and the overall structure in an easily controllable way . In DNA nanotechnology , the base sequences of strands are rationally designed by researchers so that the base pairing interactions cause the strands to assemble in the desired conformation . While DNA is the dominant material used , structures incorporating other nucleic acids such as RNA and peptide nucleic acid ( PNA ) have also been constructed . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 DNA nanotechnology is sometimes divided into two overlapping subfields : structural DNA nanotechnology and dynamic DNA nanotechnology . Structural DNA nanotechnology , sometimes abbreviated as SDN , focuses on synthesizing and characterizing nucleic acid complexes and materials that assemble into a static , equilibrium end state . On the other hand , dynamic DNA nanotechnology focuses on complexes with useful non @-@ equilibrium behavior such as the ability to reconfigure based on a chemical or physical stimulus . Some complexes , such as nucleic acid <unk> devices , combine features of both the structural and dynamic subfields . 
 The complexes constructed in structural DNA nanotechnology use topologically branched nucleic acid structures containing junctions . ( In contrast , most biological DNA exists as an unbranched double helix . ) One of the simplest branched structures is a four @-@ arm junction that consists of four individual DNA strands , portions of which are complementary in a specific pattern . Unlike in natural Holliday junctions , each arm in the artificial immobile four @-@ arm junction has a different base sequence , causing the junction point to be fixed at a certain position . Multiple junctions can be combined in the same complex , such as in the widely used double @-@ crossover ( DX ) motif , which contains two parallel double helical domains with individual strands crossing between the domains at two crossover points . Each crossover point is itself topologically a four @-@ arm junction , but is constrained to a single orientation , as opposed to the flexible single four @-@ arm junction , providing a rigidity that makes the DX motif suitable as a structural building block for larger DNA complexes . 
 Dynamic DNA nanotechnology uses a mechanism called toehold @-@ mediated strand displacement to allow the nucleic acid complexes to reconfigure in response to the addition of a new nucleic acid strand . In this reaction , the incoming strand binds to a single @-@ stranded toehold region of a double @-@ stranded complex , and then displaces one of the strands bound in the original complex through a branch migration process . The overall effect is that one of the strands in the complex is replaced with another one . In addition , reconfigurable structures and devices can be made using functional nucleic acids such as <unk> and ribozymes , which are capable of performing chemical reactions , and <unk> , which can bind to specific proteins or small molecules . 
 = = Structural DNA nanotechnology = = 
 Structural DNA nanotechnology , sometimes abbreviated as SDN , focuses on synthesizing and characterizing nucleic acid complexes and materials where the assembly has a static , equilibrium endpoint . The nucleic acid double helix has a robust , defined three @-@ dimensional geometry that makes it possible to predict and design the structures of more complicated nucleic acid complexes . Many such structures have been created , including two- and three @-@ dimensional structures , and periodic , aperiodic , and discrete structures . 
 = = = Extended lattices = = = 
 Small nucleic acid complexes can be equipped with sticky ends and combined into larger two @-@ dimensional periodic lattices containing a specific tessellated pattern of the individual molecular tiles . The earliest example of this used double @-@ crossover ( DX ) complexes as the basic tiles , each containing four sticky ends designed with sequences that caused the DX units to combine into periodic two @-@ dimensional flat sheets that are essentially rigid two @-@ dimensional crystals of DNA . Two @-@ dimensional arrays have been made from other motifs as well , including the Holliday junction rhombus lattice , and various DX @-@ based arrays making use of a double @-@ cohesion scheme . The top two images at right show examples of tile @-@ based periodic lattices . 
 Two @-@ dimensional arrays can be made to exhibit aperiodic structures whose assembly implements a specific algorithm , exhibiting one form of DNA computing . The DX tiles can have their sticky end sequences chosen so that they act as Wang tiles , allowing them to perform computation . A DX array whose assembly encodes an XOR operation has been demonstrated ; this allows the DNA array to implement a cellular automaton that generates a fractal known as the Sierpinski gasket . The third image at right shows this type of array . Another system has the function of a binary counter , displaying a representation of increasing binary numbers as it grows . These results show that computation can be incorporated into the assembly of DNA arrays . 
 DX arrays have been made to form hollow nanotubes 4 – 20 nm in diameter , essentially two @-@ dimensional lattices which curve back upon themselves . These DNA nanotubes are somewhat similar in size and shape to carbon nanotubes , and while they lack the electrical conductance of carbon nanotubes , DNA nanotubes are more easily modified and connected to other structures . One of many schemes for constructing DNA nanotubes uses a lattice of curved DX tiles that curls around itself and closes into a tube . In an alternative method that allows the circumference to be specified in a simple , modular fashion using single @-@ stranded tiles , the rigidity of the tube is an emergent property . 
 The creation of three @-@ dimensional lattices out of DNA was the earliest goal of DNA nanotechnology , but this proved to be one of the most difficult to realize . Success using a motif based on the concept of tensegrity , a balance between tension and compression forces , was finally reported in 2009 . 
 = = = Discrete structures = = = 
 Researchers have synthesized a number of three @-@ dimensional DNA complexes that each have the connectivity of a polyhedron , such as a cube or octahedron , meaning that the DNA duplexes trace the edges of a polyhedron with a DNA junction at each vertex . The earliest demonstrations of DNA polyhedra were very work @-@ intensive , requiring multiple <unk> and solid @-@ phase synthesis steps to create <unk> polyhedra . Subsequent work yielded polyhedra whose synthesis was much easier . These include a DNA octahedron made from a long single strand designed to fold into the correct conformation , and a tetrahedron that can be produced from four DNA strands in a single step , pictured at the top of this article . 
 Nanostructures of arbitrary , non @-@ regular shapes are usually made using the DNA origami method . These structures consist of a long , natural virus strand as a " scaffold " , which is made to fold into the desired shape by computationally designed short " staple " strands . This method has the advantages of being easy to design , as the base sequence is predetermined by the scaffold strand sequence , and not requiring high strand purity and accurate stoichiometry , as most other DNA nanotechnology methods do . DNA origami was first demonstrated for two @-@ dimensional shapes , such as a smiley face and a coarse map of the Western Hemisphere . Solid three @-@ dimensional structures can be made by using parallel DNA helices arranged in a honeycomb pattern , and structures with two @-@ dimensional faces can be made to fold into a hollow overall three @-@ dimensional shape , akin to a cardboard box . These can be programmed to open and reveal or release a molecular cargo in response to a stimulus , making them potentially useful as programmable molecular cages . 
 = = = <unk> assembly = = = 
 Nucleic acid structures can be made to incorporate molecules other than nucleic acids , sometimes called <unk> , including proteins , metallic nanoparticles , quantum dots , and fullerenes . This allows the construction of materials and devices with a range of functionalities much greater than is possible with nucleic acids alone . The goal is to use the self @-@ assembly of the nucleic acid structures to template the assembly of the nanoparticles hosted on them , controlling their position and in some cases orientation . Many of these schemes use a covalent attachment scheme , using oligonucleotides with amide or thiol functional groups as a chemical handle to bind the <unk> . This covalent binding scheme has been used to arrange gold nanoparticles on a DX @-@ based array , and to arrange streptavidin protein molecules into specific patterns on a DX array . A non @-@ covalent hosting scheme using <unk> polyamides on a DX array was used to arrange streptavidin proteins in a specific pattern on a DX array . Carbon nanotubes have been hosted on DNA arrays in a pattern allowing the assembly to act as a molecular electronic device , a carbon nanotube field @-@ effect transistor . In addition , there are nucleic acid <unk> methods , in which the nucleic acid is replaced by a metal which assumes the general shape of the original nucleic acid structure , and schemes for using nucleic acid nanostructures as lithography masks , transferring their pattern into a solid surface . 
 = = Dynamic DNA nanotechnology = = 
 Dynamic DNA nanotechnology focuses on creating nucleic acid systems with designed dynamic functionalities related to their overall structures , such as computation and mechanical motion . There is some overlap between structural and dynamic DNA nanotechnology , as structures can be formed through annealing and then reconfigured dynamically , or can be made to form dynamically in the first place . 
 = = = <unk> devices = = = 
 DNA complexes have been made that change their conformation upon some stimulus , making them one form of <unk> . These structures are initially formed in the same way as the static structures made in structural DNA nanotechnology , but are designed so that dynamic reconfiguration is possible after the initial assembly . The earliest such device made use of the transition between the B @-@ DNA and Z @-@ DNA forms to respond to a change in buffer conditions by undergoing a twisting motion . This reliance on buffer conditions , however , caused all devices to change state at the same time . Subsequent systems could change states based upon the presence of control strands , allowing multiple devices to be independently operated in solution . Some examples of such systems are a " molecular tweezers " design that has an open and a closed state , a device that could switch from a <unk> @-@ crossover ( PX ) conformation to a double @-@ junction ( <unk> ) conformation , undergoing rotational motion in the process , and a two @-@ dimensional array that could dynamically expand and contract in response to control strands . Structures have also been made that dynamically open or close , potentially acting as a molecular cage to release or reveal a functional cargo upon opening . 
 DNA walkers are a class of nucleic acid nanomachines that exhibit directional motion along a linear track . A large number of schemes have been demonstrated . One strategy is to control the motion of the walker along the track using control strands that need to be manually added in sequence . Another approach is to make use of restriction enzymes or <unk> to cleave the strands and cause the walker to move forward , which has the advantage of running autonomously . A later system could walk upon a two @-@ dimensional surface rather than a linear track , and demonstrated the ability to selectively pick up and move molecular cargo . Additionally , a linear walker has been demonstrated that performs DNA @-@ templated synthesis as the walker advances along the track , allowing autonomous multistep chemical synthesis directed by the walker . The synthetic DNA walkers ' function is similar to that of the proteins dynein and kinesin . 
 = = = Strand displacement cascades = = = 
 Cascades of strand displacement reactions can be used for either computational or structural purposes . An individual strand displacement reaction involves revealing a new sequence in response to the presence of some initiator strand . Many such reactions can be linked into a cascade where the newly revealed output sequence of one reaction can initiate another strand displacement reaction elsewhere . This in turn allows for the construction of chemical reaction networks with many components , exhibiting complex computational and information processing abilities . These cascades are made energetically favorable through the formation of new base pairs , and the entropy gain from disassembly reactions . Strand displacement cascades allow for isothermal operation of the assembly or computational process , as opposed to traditional nucleic acid assembly 's requirement for a thermal annealing step , where the temperature is raised and then slowly lowered to ensure proper formation of the desired structure . They can also support catalytic functionality of the initiator species , where less than one equivalent of the initiator can cause the reaction to go to completion . 
 Strand displacement complexes can be used to make molecular logic gates capable of complex computation . Unlike traditional electronic computers , which use electric current as inputs and outputs , molecular computers use the concentrations of specific chemical species as signals . In the case of nucleic acid strand displacement circuits , the signal is the presence of nucleic acid strands that are released or consumed by binding and unbinding events to other strands in displacement complexes . This approach has been used to make logic gates such as AND , OR , and NOT gates . More recently , a four @-@ bit circuit was demonstrated that can compute the square root of the integers 0 – 15 , using a system of gates containing 130 DNA strands . 
 Another use of strand displacement cascades is to make dynamically assembled structures . These use a hairpin structure for the reactants , so that when the input strand binds , the newly revealed sequence is on the same molecule rather than disassembling . This allows new opened hairpins to be added to a growing complex . This approach has been used to make simple structures such as three- and four @-@ arm junctions and <unk> . 
 = = Applications = = 
 DNA nanotechnology provides one of the few ways to form designed , complex structures with precise control over nanoscale features . The field is beginning to see application to solve basic science problems in structural biology and biophysics . The earliest such application envisaged for the field , and one still in development , is in crystallography , where molecules that are difficult to crystallize in isolation could be arranged within a three @-@ dimensional nucleic acid lattice , allowing determination of their structure . Another application is the use of DNA origami rods to replace liquid crystals in residual dipolar coupling experiments in protein NMR spectroscopy ; using DNA origami is advantageous because , unlike liquid crystals , they are tolerant of the detergents needed to suspend membrane proteins in solution . DNA walkers have been used as nanoscale assembly lines to move nanoparticles and direct chemical synthesis . Furthermore , DNA origami structures have aided in the biophysical studies of enzyme function and protein folding . 
 DNA nanotechnology is moving towards potential real @-@ world applications . The ability of nucleic acid arrays to arrange other molecules indicates its potential applications in molecular scale electronics . The assembly of a nucleic acid structure could be used to template the assembly of a molecular electronic elements such as molecular wires , providing a method for nanometer @-@ scale control of the placement and overall architecture of the device analogous to a molecular breadboard . DNA nanotechnology has been compared to the concept of programmable matter because of the coupling of computation to its material properties . 
 In a study conducted by a group of scientists from <unk> center and <unk> Center in Aarhus university ( Aarhus ) , researchers were able to construct a small multi @-@ switchable 3D DNA Box <unk> . The proposed <unk> was characterized by AFM , TEM and FRET . The constructed box was shown to have a unique <unk> mechanism , which enabled it to repeatedly open and close in response to a unique set of DNA or RNA keys . The authors proposed that this " DNA device can potentially be used for a broad range of applications such as controlling the function of single molecules , controlled drug delivery , and molecular computing . " . 
 There are potential applications for DNA nanotechnology in <unk> , making use of its ability to perform computation in a biocompatible format to make " smart drugs " for targeted drug delivery . One such system being investigated uses a hollow DNA box containing proteins that induce apoptosis , or cell death , that will only open when in proximity to a cancer cell . There has additionally been interest in expressing these artificial structures in engineered living bacterial cells , most likely using the transcribed RNA for the assembly , although it is unknown whether these complex structures are able to efficiently fold or assemble in the cell 's cytoplasm . If successful , this could enable directed evolution of nucleic acid nanostructures . Scientists at Oxford University reported the self @-@ assembly of four short strands of synthetic DNA into a cage which is capable of entering cells and surviving for at least 48 hours . The fluorescently labeled DNA tetrahedra were found to remain intact in the laboratory cultured human kidney cells despite the attack by cellular enzymes after two days . This experiment showed the potential of drug delivery inside the living cells using the DNA ‘ cage ’ . A DNA tetrahedron was used to deliver RNA Interference ( RNAi ) in a mouse model , reported a team of researchers in MIT . Delivery of the interfering RNA for treatment has showed some success using polymer or lipid , but there are limitations of safety and imprecise targeting , in addition to short shelf life in the blood stream . The DNA nanostructure created by the team consists of six strands of DNA to form a tetrahedron , with a single strand of RNA affixed to each of the six edges . The tetrahedron is further equipped with targeting protein , three folate molecules , which lead the DNA nanoparticles to the abundant folate receptors found on some tumors . The result showed that the gene expression targeted by the RNAi , luciferase , dropped by more than half . This study shows promise in using DNA nanotechnology as an effective tool to deliver treatment using the emerging RNA Interference technology . 
 = = Design = = 
 DNA nanostructures must be rationally designed so that the individual nucleic acid strands will assemble into the desired structures . This process usually begins with the specification of a desired target structure or functionality . Then , the overall secondary structure of the target complex is determined , specifying the arrangement of nucleic acid strands within the structure , and which portions of those strands should be bound to each other . The last step is the primary structure design , which is the specification of the actual base sequences of each nucleic acid strand . 
 = = = Structural design = = = 
 The first step in designing a nucleic acid nanostructure is to decide how a given structure should be represented by a specific arrangement of nucleic acid strands . This design step determines the secondary structure , or the positions of the base pairs that hold the individual strands together in the desired shape . Several approaches have been demonstrated : 
 Tile @-@ based structures . This approach breaks the target structure into smaller units with strong binding between the strands contained in each unit , and weaker interactions between the units . It is often used to make periodic lattices , but can also be used to implement algorithmic self @-@ assembly , making them a platform for DNA computing . This was the dominant design strategy used from the mid @-@ 1990s until the mid @-@ 2000s , when the DNA origami methodology was developed . 
 Folding structures . An alternative to the tile @-@ based approach , folding approaches make the nanostructure from a single long strand . This long strand can either have a designed sequence that folds due to its interactions with itself , or it can be folded into the desired shape by using shorter , " staple " strands . This latter method is called DNA origami , which allows the creation of nanoscale two- and three @-@ dimensional shapes ( see Discrete structures above ) . 
 Dynamic assembly . This approach directly controls the kinetics of DNA self @-@ assembly , specifying all of the intermediate steps in the reaction mechanism in addition to the final product . This is done using starting materials which adopt a hairpin structure ; these then assemble into the final conformation in a cascade reaction , in a specific order ( see Strand displacement cascades below ) . This approach has the advantage of proceeding <unk> , at a constant temperature . This is in contrast to the thermodynamic approaches , which require a thermal annealing step where a temperature change is required to trigger the assembly and favor proper formation of the desired structure . 
 = = = Sequence design = = = 
 After any of the above approaches are used to design the secondary structure of a target complex , an actual sequence of nucleotides that will form into the desired structure must be devised . Nucleic acid design is the process of assigning a specific nucleic acid base sequence to each of a structure 's constituent strands so that they will associate into a desired conformation . Most methods have the goal of designing sequences so that the target structure has the lowest energy , and is thus the most thermodynamically favorable , while incorrectly assembled structures have higher energies and are thus disfavored . This is done either through simple , faster heuristic methods such as sequence symmetry minimization , or by using a full nearest @-@ neighbor thermodynamic model , which is more accurate but slower and more computationally intensive . Geometric models are used to examine tertiary structure of the nanostructures and to ensure that the complexes are not overly strained . 
 Nucleic acid design has similar goals to protein design . In both , the sequence of monomers is designed to favor the desired target structure and to disfavor other structures . Nucleic acid design has the advantage of being much computationally easier than protein design , because the simple base pairing rules are sufficient to predict a structure 's energetic favorability , and detailed information about the overall three @-@ dimensional folding of the structure is not required . This allows the use of simple heuristic methods that yield experimentally robust designs . However , nucleic acid structures are less versatile than proteins in their functionality because of proteins ' increased ability to fold into complex structures , as well as the limited chemical diversity of the four nucleotides as compared to the twenty proteinogenic amino acids . 
 = = Materials and methods = = 
 The sequences of the DNA strands making up a target structure are designed computationally , using molecular modeling and thermodynamic modeling software . The nucleic acids themselves are then synthesized using standard oligonucleotide synthesis methods , usually automated in an oligonucleotide synthesizer , and strands of custom sequences are commercially available . <unk> can be purified by <unk> gel electrophoresis if needed , and precise concentrations determined via any of several nucleic acid quantitation methods using ultraviolet absorbance spectroscopy . 
 The fully formed target structures can be verified using native gel electrophoresis , which gives size and shape information for the nucleic acid complexes . An electrophoretic mobility shift assay can assess whether a structure incorporates all desired strands . Fluorescent labeling and Förster resonance energy transfer ( FRET ) are sometimes used to characterize the structure of the complexes . 
 Nucleic acid structures can be directly imaged by atomic force microscopy , which is well suited to extended two @-@ dimensional structures , but less useful for discrete three @-@ dimensional structures because of the microscope tip 's interaction with the fragile nucleic acid structure ; transmission electron microscopy and cryo @-@ electron microscopy are often used in this case . Extended three @-@ dimensional lattices are analyzed by X @-@ ray crystallography . 
 = = History = = 
 The conceptual foundation for DNA nanotechnology was first laid out by Nadrian Seeman in the early 1980s . Seeman 's original motivation was to create a three @-@ dimensional DNA lattice for orienting other large molecules , which would simplify their crystallographic study by eliminating the difficult process of obtaining pure crystals . This idea had reportedly come to him in late 1980 , after realizing the similarity between the woodcut Depth by M. C. Escher and an array of DNA six @-@ arm junctions . A number of natural branched DNA structures were known at the time , including the DNA replication fork and the mobile Holliday junction , but Seeman 's insight was that immobile nucleic acid junctions could be created by properly designing the strand sequences to remove symmetry in the assembled molecule , and that these immobile junctions could in principle be combined into rigid crystalline lattices . The first theoretical paper proposing this scheme was published in 1982 , and the first experimental demonstration of an immobile DNA junction was published the following year . 
 In 1991 , Seeman 's laboratory published a report on the synthesis of a cube made of DNA , the first synthetic three @-@ dimensional nucleic acid nanostructure , for which he received the 1995 Feynman Prize in Nanotechnology . This was followed by a DNA truncated octahedron . However , it soon became clear that these structures , polygonal shapes with flexible junctions as their vertices , were not rigid enough to form extended three @-@ dimensional lattices . Seeman developed the more rigid double @-@ crossover ( DX ) motif , and in 1998 , in collaboration with Erik Winfree , published the creation of two @-@ dimensional lattices of DX tiles . These tile @-@ based structures had the advantage that they provided the capability to implement DNA computing , which was demonstrated by Winfree and Paul Rothemund in their 2004 paper on the algorithmic self @-@ assembly of a Sierpinski gasket structure , and for which they shared the 2006 Feynman Prize in Nanotechnology . Winfree 's key insight was that the DX tiles could be used as Wang tiles , meaning that their assembly was capable of performing computation . The synthesis of a three @-@ dimensional lattice was finally published by Seeman in 2009 , nearly thirty years after he had set out to achieve it . 
 New capabilities continued to be discovered for designed DNA structures throughout the 2000s . The first DNA nanomachine — a motif that changes its structure in response to an input — was demonstrated in 1999 by Seeman . An improved system , which was the first nucleic acid device to make use of toehold @-@ mediated strand displacement , was demonstrated by Bernard <unk> the following year . The next advance was to translate this into mechanical motion , and in 2004 and 2005 , a number of DNA walker systems were demonstrated by the groups of Seeman , Niles Pierce , Andrew <unk> , and Chengde Mao . The idea of using DNA arrays to template the assembly of other molecules such as nanoparticles and proteins , first suggested by Bruche Robinson and Seeman in 1987 , was demonstrated in 2002 by Seeman , <unk> et al. and subsequently by numerous other groups . 
 In 2006 , Rothemund first demonstrated the DNA origami technique for easily and robustly creating folded DNA structures of arbitrary shape . Rothemund had conceived of this method as being conceptually intermediate between Seeman 's DX lattices , which used many short strands , and William Shih 's DNA octahedron , which consisted mostly of one very long strand . Rothemund 's DNA origami contains a long strand whose folding is assisted by a number of short strands . This method allowed the creation of much larger structures than were previously possible , and which are less technically demanding to design and synthesize . DNA origami was the cover story of Nature on March 15 , 2006 . Rothemund 's research demonstrating two @-@ dimensional DNA origami structures was followed by the demonstration of solid three @-@ dimensional DNA origami by Douglas et al. in 2009 , while the labs of Jørgen <unk> and Yan demonstrated hollow three @-@ dimensional structures made out of two @-@ dimensional faces . 
 DNA nanotechnology was initially met with some skepticism due to the unusual non @-@ biological use of nucleic acids as materials for building structures and doing computation , and the preponderance of proof of principle experiments that extended the capabilities of the field but were far from actual applications . Seeman 's 1991 paper on the synthesis of the DNA cube was rejected by the journal Science after one reviewer praised its originality while another criticized it for its lack of biological relevance . By the early 2010s , however , the field was considered to have increased its capabilities to the point that applications for basic science research were beginning to be realized , and practical applications in medicine and other fields were beginning to be considered feasible . The field had grown from very few active laboratories in 2001 to at least 60 in 2010 , which increased the talent pool and thus the number of scientific advances in the field during that decade . 
 = Protein C = 
 Protein C , also known as <unk> IIA and blood coagulation factor XIV , is a zymogen , the activated form of which plays an important role in regulating anticoagulation , inflammation , cell death , and maintaining the permeability of blood vessel walls in humans and other animals . Activated protein C ( APC ) performs these operations primarily by <unk> inactivating proteins Factor Va and Factor VIIIa . APC is classified as a serine protease as it contains a residue of serine in its active site . In humans , protein C is encoded by the PROC gene , which is found on chromosome 2 . 
 The <unk> form of protein C is a vitamin K @-@ dependent glycoprotein that circulates in blood plasma . Its structure is that of a two @-@ chain polypeptide consisting of a light chain and a heavy chain connected by a disulfide bond . The protein C zymogen is activated when it binds to thrombin , another protein heavily involved in coagulation , and protein C 's activation is greatly promoted by the presence of thrombomodulin and endothelial protein C receptors ( <unk> ) . Because of EPCR 's role , activated protein C is found primarily near endothelial cells ( i.e. , those that make up the walls of blood vessels ) , and it is these cells and leukocytes ( white blood cells ) that APC affects . Because of the crucial role that protein C plays as an anticoagulant , those with deficiencies in protein C , or some kind of resistance to APC , suffer from a significantly increased risk of forming dangerous blood clots ( thrombosis ) . 
 Research into the clinical use of activated protein C also known as <unk> alfa @-@ activated ( branded <unk> ) has been surrounded by controversy . The manufacturer Eli Lilly and Company ran an aggressive marketing campaign to promote its use in people with severe sepsis and septic shock including the sponsoring of the 2004 Surviving Sepsis Campaign Guidelines . A 2011 Cochrane review however found that its use cannot be recommended as it does not improve survival ( and increases bleeding risk ) . 
 = = History = = 
 Protein C 's anticoagulant role in the human body was first noted by Seegers et al. in 1960 , who gave protein C its original name , <unk> II @-@ a . Protein C was first isolated by Johan Stenflo from bovine plasma in 1976 , and Stenflo determined it to be a vitamin K @-@ dependent protein . He named it protein C because it was the third protein ( " peak C " ) that eluted from a <unk> @-@ <unk> ion @-@ exchange <unk> . Seegers was , at the time , searching for vitamin K @-@ dependent coagulation factors undetected by clotting assays , which measure global clotting function . Soon after this , Seegers recognised Stenflo 's discovery was identical with his own . Activated protein C was discovered later that year , and in 1977 it was first recognised that APC inactivates Factor Va . In 1980 , <unk> and Davie discovered that APC also inactivates Factor VIIIa , and soon after , Protein S was recognised as a cofactor by Walker . In 1982 , a family study by Griffin et al. first associated protein C deficiency with symptoms of venous thrombosis . Homozygous protein C deficiency and the consequent serious health effects were described in 1984 by several <unk> cDNA cloning of protein C was first performed in 1984 by Beckmann et al. which produced a map of the gene responsible for producing protein C in the liver . In 1987 a seminal experiment was performed ( Taylor et al . ) whereby it was demonstrated that activated protein C prevented coagulopathy and death in baboons infused with lethal concentrations of E. coli . 
 In 1993 , a heritable resistance to APC was detected by <unk> et al. and associated with familial thrombophilia . In 1994 , the relatively common genetic mutation that produces Factor VLeiden was noted ( <unk> et al . ) . Two years later , Gla @-@ <unk> APC was imaged at a resolution of 2 @.@ 8 <unk> . Beginning with the <unk> clinical trial of 2001 , it was recognised that many of the symptoms of sepsis may be ameliorated by infusion of APC , and mortality rates of septic patients may be significantly decreased . Near the end of that year , <unk> alfa ( activated ) , a recombinant human activated protein C , became the first drug approved by the U.S. FDA for treating severe sepsis . In 2002 , Science published an article that first showed protein C activates protease @-@ activated receptor @-@ 1 ( PAR @-@ 1 ) and this process accounts for the protein 's modulation of the immune system . 
 = = Genetics = = 
 The biologic instructions for synthesising protein C in humans are encoded in the gene officially named " protein C ( <unk> of coagulation factors Va and VIIIa ) " . The gene 's symbol approved by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee is " PROC " from " protein C " . It is located on the second chromosome ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) and comprises nine exons . The nucleotide sequence that codes for human protein C is approximately 11 @,@ 000 bases long . 
 = = Structure = = 
 Human protein C is a vitamin K @-@ dependent glycoprotein structurally similar to other vitamin K @-@ dependent proteins affecting blood clotting , such as prothrombin , Factor VII , Factor IX and Factor X. Protein C synthesis occurs in the liver and begins with a single @-@ chain precursor molecule : a 32 amino acid N @-@ terminus signal peptide preceding a <unk> . Protein C is formed when a dipeptide of <unk> and <unk> is removed ; this causes the transformation into a heterodimer with N @-@ linked carbohydrates on each chain . The protein has one light chain ( 21 kDa ) and one heavy chain ( 41 kDa ) connected by a disulfide bond between <unk> and <unk> . 
 Inactive protein C comprises 419 amino acids in multiple domains : one Gla domain ( residues 43 – 88 ) ; a helical aromatic segment ( 89 – 96 ) ; two epidermal growth factor ( EGF ) -like domains ( 97 – 132 and 136 – 176 ) ; an activation peptide ( 200 – 211 ) ; and a trypsin @-@ like serine protease domain ( 212 – 450 ) . The light chain contains the <unk> and EGF @-@ like domains and the aromatic segment . The heavy chain contains the protease domain and the activation <unk> . It is in this form that 85 – 90 % of protein C circulates in the plasma as a zymogen , waiting to be activated . The remaining protein C zymogen comprises slightly modified forms of the protein . Activation of the enzyme occurs when a thrombin molecule cleaves away the activation peptide from the N @-@ terminus of the heavy chain . The active site contains a catalytic triad typical of serine proteases ( <unk> , <unk> and <unk> ) . 
 The Gla domain is particularly useful for binding to negatively charged phospholipids for anticoagulation and to EPCR for <unk> . One particular <unk> augments protein C 's ability to inactivate Factor Va efficiently . Another is necessary for interacting with thrombomodulin . 
 = = Physiology = = 
 The activation of protein C is strongly promoted by thrombomodulin and endothelial protein C receptor ( EPCR ) , the latter of which is found primarily on endothelial cells ( cells on the inside of blood vessels ) . The presence of thrombomodulin accelerates activation by several orders of magnitude , and EPCR speeds up activation by a factor of 20 . If either of these two proteins is absent in murine specimens , the mouse dies from excessive blood @-@ clotting while still in an embryonic state . On the endothelium , APC performs a major role in regulating blood clotting , inflammation , and cell death ( apoptosis ) . Because of the accelerating effect of thrombomodulin on the activation of protein C , the protein may be said to be activated not by thrombin but the thrombin @-@ thrombomodulin ( or even thrombin @-@ thrombomodulin @-@ EPCR ) complex . Once in active form , APC may or may not remain bound to EPCR , to which it has approximately the same affinity as the protein zymogen . 
 Protein C in zymogen form is present in normal adult human blood plasma at concentrations between 65 – 135 IU / dL . Activated protein C is found at levels approximately 2000 times lower than this . Mild protein C deficiency corresponds to plasma levels above 20 IU / dL , but below the normal range . Moderately severe deficiencies describe blood concentrations between 1 and 20 IU / dL ; severe deficiencies yield levels of protein C that are below 1 IU / dL or are undetectable . Protein C levels in a healthy term infant average 40 IU / dL . The concentration of protein C increases until six months , when the mean level is 60 IU / dL ; the level stays low through childhood until it reaches adult levels after adolescence . The half @-@ life of activated protein C is around 15 minutes . 
 = = Pathways = = 
 The protein C pathways are the specific chemical reactions that control the level of expression of APC and its activity in the body . Protein C is pleiotropic , with two main classes of functions : anticoagulation and <unk> ( its direct effect on cells ) . Which function protein C performs depends on whether or not APC remains bound to EPCR after it is activated ; the anticoagulative effects of APC occur when it does not . In this case , protein C functions as an anticoagulant by irreversibly <unk> inactivating Factor Va and Factor VIIIa , turning them into Factor Vi and Factor <unk> respectively . When still bound to EPCR , activated protein C performs its cytoprotective effects , acting on the effector substrate PAR @-@ 1 , protease @-@ activated receptor @-@ 1 . To a degree , APC 's anticoagulant properties are independent of its cytoprotective ones , in that expression of one pathway is not affected by the existence of the other . 
 The activity of protein C may be down @-@ regulated by reducing the amount either of available thrombomodulin or of EPCR . This may be done by inflammatory cytokines , such as interleukin @-@ 1β ( IL @-@ 1β ) and tumor necrosis factor @-@ α ( TNF @-@ α ) . Activated leukocytes release these inflammatory mediators during inflammation , inhibiting the creation of both thrombomodulin and EPCR , and inducing their shedding from the endothelial surface . Both of these actions down @-@ regulate protein C activation . <unk> itself may also have an effect on the levels of EPCR . In addition , proteins released from cells can impede protein C activation , for example eosinophil , which may explain thrombosis in <unk> heart disease . Protein C may be up @-@ regulated by platelet factor 4 . This cytokine is conjectured to improve activation of protein C by forming an electrostatic bridge from protein C 's Gla domain to the <unk> ( <unk> ) domain of thrombomodulin , reducing the Michaelis constant ( KM ) for their reaction . In addition , Protein C is inhibited by protein C inhibitor . 
 = = = <unk> effects = = = 
 Protein C is a major component in anticoagulation in the human body . It acts as a serine protease zymogen : APC <unk> peptide bonds in activated Factor V and Factor VIII ( Factor Va and Factor VIIIa ) , and one of the amino acids in the bond is serine . These proteins that APC inactivates , Factor Va and Factor VIIIa , are highly procoagulant cofactors in the generation of thrombin , which is a crucial element in blood clotting ; together they are part of the <unk> complex . Cofactors in the inactivation of Factor Va and Factor VIIIa include protein S , Factor V , high @-@ density lipoprotein , anionic phospholipids and glycosphingolipids . 
 Factor Va binds to prothrombin and Factor Xa , increasing the rate at which thrombin is produced by four orders of magnitude ( <unk> ) . Inactivation of Factor Va thus practically halts the production of thrombin . Factor VIII , on the other hand , is a cofactor in production of activated Factor X , which in turn converts prothrombin into thrombin . Factor VIIIa augments Factor X activation by a factor of around 200 @,@ 000 . Because of its importance in clotting , Factor VIII is also known as anti @-@ <unk> factor , and deficiencies of Factor VIII cause haemophilia A. 
 APC inactivates Factor Va by making three cleavages ( Arg306 , Arg506 , <unk> ) . The cleavages at both Arg306 and Arg506 diminish the molecule 's attraction to Factor Xa , and though the first of these sites is slow to be cleaved , it is entirely necessary to the functioning of Factor V. Protein S aids this process by catalysing the proteolysis at Arg306 , in which the A2 domain of Factor V is dissociated from the rest of the protein . Protein S also binds to Factor Xa , inhibiting the latter from diminishing APC 's inactivation of Factor Va . 
 The inactivation of Factor VIIIa is not as well understood . The half @-@ life of Factor VIIIa is only around two minutes unless Factor IXa is present to stabilise it . Some have questioned the significance of APC 's inactivation of Factor VIIIa , and it is unknown to what degree Factor V and protein S are cofactors in its proteolysis . It is known that APC works on Factor VIIIa by cleaving at two sites , <unk> and <unk> , either of which is sufficient to disable Factor VIIIa and convert it to Factor <unk> . 
 = = = <unk> effects = = = 
 When APC is bound to EPCR , it performs a number of important cytoprotective ( i.e. cell @-@ protecting ) functions , most of which are known to require EPCR and PAR @-@ 1 . These include regulating gene expression , anti @-@ inflammatory effects , antiapoptotic effects and protecting endothelial barrier function . 
 Treatment of cells with APC demonstrates that its gene expression modulation effectively controls major pathways for inflammatory and apoptotic behaviour . There are about 20 genes that are up @-@ regulated by protein C , and 20 genes that are down @-@ regulated : the former are generally anti @-@ inflammatory and antiapoptotic pathways , while the latter tend to be proinflammatory and <unk> . APC 's mechanisms for altering gene expression profiles are not well @-@ understood , but it is believed that they at least partly involve an inhibitory effect on transcription factor activity . Important proteins that APC up @-@ regulates include Bcl @-@ 2 , <unk> and IAP . APC effects significant down @-@ regulation of p53 and Bax . 
 APC has anti @-@ inflammatory effects on endothelial cells and leukocytes . APC affects endothelial cells by inhibiting inflammatory mediator release and down @-@ regulating vascular adhesion molecules . This reduces leukocyte adhesion and infiltration into tissues , while also limiting damage to underlying tissue . APC supports endothelial barrier function and reduces chemotaxis . APC inhibits the release of inflammatory @-@ response mediators in leukocytes as well as endothelial cells , by reducing cytokine response , and maybe diminishing systemic inflammatory response , such as is seen in sepsis . Studies on both rats and humans have demonstrated that APC reduces endotoxin @-@ induced pulmonary injury and inflammation . 
 Scientists recognise activated protein C 's antiapoptotic effects , but are unclear as to the exact mechanisms by which apoptosis is inhibited . It is known that APC is neuroprotective . APC 's antiapoptotic effects are part of the reason that APC is effective in treating sepsis , as reduced levels of apoptosis are correlated with higher survival rates in septic patients . <unk> is achieved with diminished activation of caspase 3 and caspase 8 , improved Bax / Bcl @-@ 2 ratio and down @-@ regulation of p53 . 
 Activated protein C also provides much protection of endothelial barrier function . <unk> barrier breakdown , and the corresponding increase in endothelial permeability , are associated with swelling , hypotension and inflammation , all problems of sepsis . APC protects endothelial barrier function by inducing PAR @-@ 1 dependent sphingosine kinase @-@ 1 activation and up @-@ regulating sphingosine @-@ 1 @-@ phosphate with sphingosine kinase . 
 = = Role in disease = = 
 A genetic protein C deficiency , in its mild form associated with simple heterozygosity , causes a significantly increased risk of venous thrombosis in adults . If a fetus is homozygous or compound heterozygous for the deficiency , there may be a presentation of purpura fulminans , severe disseminated intravascular coagulation and simultaneous venous thromboembolism in the womb ; this is very severe and usually fatal . Deletion of the protein C gene in mice causes fetal death around the time of birth . Fetal mice with no protein C develop normally at first , but experience severe bleeding , coagulopathy , deposition of fibrin and necrosis of the liver . 
 The frequency of protein C deficiency among asymptomatic individuals is between 1 in 200 and 1 in 500 . In contrast , significant symptoms of the deficiency are detectable in 1 in 20 @,@ 000 individuals . No racial nor ethnic biases have been detected . 
 Activated protein C resistance occurs when APC is unable to perform its functions . This disease has similar symptoms to protein C deficiency . The most common mutation leading to activated protein C resistance among Caucasians is at the cleavage site in Factor V for APC . There , Arg506 is replaced with <unk> , producing Factor V Leiden . This mutation is also called a <unk> . The mutation leading to the loss of this cleavage site actually stops APC from effectively inactivating both Factor Va and Factor VIIIa . Thus , the person 's blood clots too readily , and he is perpetually at an increased risk for thrombosis . Individuals heterozygous for the Factor VLeiden mutation carry a risk of venous thrombosis 5 – 7 times higher than in the general population . Homozygous subjects have a risk 80 times higher . This mutation is also the most common hereditary risk for venous thrombosis among Caucasians . 
 Around 5 % of APC resistance are not associated with the above mutation and Factor VLeiden . Other genetic mutations cause APC resistance , but none to the extent that Factor VLeiden does . These mutations include various other versions of Factor V , spontaneous generation of autoantibodies targeting Factor V , and dysfunction of any of APC 's cofactors . Also , some acquired conditions may reduce the efficacy of APC in performing its anticoagulative functions . Studies suggest that between 20 % and 60 % of thrombophilic patients suffer from some form of APC resistance . 
 Warfarin necrosis is an acquired protein C deficiency due to treatment with warfarin , which is a vitamin K antagonist and an anticoagulant itself . However , warfarin treatment may produce paradoxical skin lesions similar to those seen in purpura fulminans . A variant of this response presents as venous limb gangrene when warfarin is used to treat deep vein thrombosis associated with cancer . In these situations , warfarin may be restarted at a low dosage to ensure that the protein C deficiency does not present before the vitamin K coagulation factors II , IX and X are suppressed . 
 Activated protein C cleaves Plasmodium falciparum histones which are released during infection : cleavage of these histones eliminates their pro inflammatory effects .

 <unk> has been the subject of significant controversy since its approval for clinical use in 2001 . A 2011 Cochrane review concluded that it does not decrease mortality in severe sepsis or septic shock . It has been noted that rates of severe hemorrhages , drug infusion @-@ related fatal events and termination of infusion due to adverse reactions are all higher in clinical use and open @-@ label trials than in controlled trials . There is a dispute as to whether or not studies after <unk> confirm its results , and if so , for what subgroups . 
 Protein C levels have long been noted to predict mortality in patients with sepsis . Because of this , and its pleiotropic anticoagulative and cytoprotective effects , protein C has long been suggested , along with many other drugs , for use in treating patients with severe sepsis . In November of that year , the Food and Drug Administration approved <unk> alfa @-@ activated ( <unk> ) in the clinical treatment of adults suffering from severe sepsis and with a high risk of death . <unk> alfa @-@ activated is a recombinant form of human activated protein C ( <unk> ) , i.e. it is a protein produced by recombinant DNA . It is marketed as <unk> by Eli Lilly and Company , but recently recalled and taken off the market . 
 APC has been studied as way of treating lung injury , after studies showed that in patients with lung injury , reduced APC levels in specific parts of the lungs correlated with worse outcomes . APC also has been considered for use in improving patient outcome in cases of ischemic stroke , a medical emergency in which arterial blockage deprives a region of brain of oxygen , causing tissue death . Promising studies suggest that APC could be coupled with the only currently approved treatment , tissue <unk> activator ( <unk> ) , to protect the brain from <unk> 's very harmful side effects , in addition to preventing cell death from lack of oxygen ( hypoxia ) . Clinical use of APC has also been proposed for improving the outcome of pancreatic islet transplantation in treating type I diabetes . 
 = Mysteries of Isis = 
 The mysteries of Isis were religious initiation rites performed in the cult of the goddess Isis in the Greco @-@ Roman world . They were modeled on other mystery rites , particularly the Eleusinian Mysteries in honor of the Greek goddess Demeter , and originated sometime between the third century BCE and the second century CE . Despite their mainly Hellenistic origins , the mysteries did allude to beliefs from ancient Egyptian religion , in which the worship of Isis arose . By undergoing the mystery rites , initiates signaled their dedication to Isis , although they were not required to worship her exclusively . The rites were seen as a symbolic death and rebirth , and they may have been thought to guarantee that the initiate 's soul , with the goddess 's help , would continue after death in a blissful afterlife . 
 Many texts from the Roman Empire refer to the mysteries of Isis , but the only source to describe them is a work of fiction , the novel Metamorphoses , written in the second century CE by Apuleius . In it , the initiate undergoes elaborate ritual purification before descending into the innermost part of Isis 's temple , where he has an intense religious experience , seeing the gods in person . 
 Some aspects of the mysteries of Isis and of other mystery cults , particularly their connection with the afterlife , resemble important elements of Christianity . The question of whether the mysteries influenced Christianity is controversial and the evidence is unclear ; some scholars today attribute the similarities to a shared cultural background rather than direct influence . In contrast , Apuleius 's account has had direct effects in modern times . Through his description of them , the mysteries of Isis have influenced many works of fiction and modern fraternal organizations , as well as a widespread , though false , belief that the ancient Egyptians themselves had an elaborate system of mystery initiations . 
 = = Origins = = 
 Greco @-@ Roman mysteries were , in the words of the classicist Walter Burkert , " initiation rituals of a voluntary , personal , and secret character that aimed at a change of mind through experience of the sacred . " These rituals were dedicated to a particular deity or group of deities , and they used a variety of intense experiences , such as nocturnal darkness interrupted by bright light and loud music and noise , that induced a state of disorientation and an intense religious experience . Some of them involved cryptic symbolism . Initiates were not supposed to discuss some of the details of what they experienced in the mysteries , and modern understanding of these rites is limited by this secrecy . The most prestigious mysteries in the Greek world were the Eleusinian mysteries dedicated to the goddess Demeter , which were performed at Eleusis , near Athens , from at least the sixth century BCE to the end of the fourth century CE . They centered on Demeter 's search for her daughter Persephone in Greek mythology . Eleusinian initiates passed into a dark hall , the <unk> , and were subjected to terrifying sights , followed by a fiery light and a shout from the <unk> who presided over the ceremony . By this light the initiates saw objects that represented Demeter 's power over fertility , such as a sheaf of wheat , and perhaps other images that referred to the myth of Persephone . In the mysteries of the god Dionysus , which were performed in many places across the Greek world , participants celebrated in a frenzy at night , in the open air . Dionysian celebrations were connected in some way with <unk> , a group of mystical beliefs about the nature of the afterlife . 
 Isis was originally a goddess in ancient Egyptian religion , which did not include Greek @-@ style mysteries . Some Egyptian rituals were performed exclusively by priests , out of public view , but ordinary Egyptians were never permitted to join in . Other rituals may have reenacted events from Egyptian mythology , such as the ceremonies in honor of Osiris , the god of the afterlife and the mythological husband of Isis , that were performed at Abydos . The Greeks interpreted these myth @-@ based rituals as mysteries . The historian Herodotus , writing in the fifth century BCE , was the first to do so . He referred to Egyptian rites reenacting the myth of the murder of Osiris as mysteries , likening them to the mysteries of Dionysus he was familiar with in Greece . He further said that the Greek worship of Dionysus was influenced by the worship of Osiris in Egypt . Various Greek writers who came after Herodotus viewed Egypt and its priests as the source of all mystical wisdom . They claimed that many elements of Greek philosophy and culture came from Egypt , including the mystery cults . Burkert and the Egyptologist Francesco Tiradritti both say there is a grain of truth in these claims , as the oldest Greek mystery cults developed in the seventh and sixth centuries BCE , at the same time that Greece was developing closer contacts with Egyptian culture . The imagery of the afterlife found in the mystery cults may thus have been influenced by that in Egyptian afterlife beliefs . 
 Isis was one of many non @-@ Greek deities whose cults became part of Greek and Roman religion during the Hellenistic period ( 323 – 30 BCE ) , when Greek people and culture spread to lands across the Mediterranean and most of those same lands were conquered by the Roman Republic . Under the influence of Greco @-@ Roman tradition , some of these cults , including that of Isis , developed their own mystery rites . The mysteries of Isis could have emerged as far back as the early third century BCE , after the Greek Ptolemaic dynasty had taken control of Egypt . The Ptolemies promoted the cult of the god Serapis , who incorporated traits of Osiris and of Greek deities like Dionysus and the underworld god Pluto . Isis 's cult was conjoined with that of Serapis . She too was reinterpreted to resemble Greek goddesses , particularly Demeter , while retaining many of her Egyptian characteristics . The mysteries of Isis , modeled on those in Demeter 's honor at Eleusis , could have been developed at the same time , as part of this mingling of Greek and Egyptian religion . 
 Another possibility is that the mysteries developed after Isis 's Hellenized cult reached Greece itself , later in the third century BCE . Much of the early evidence of Isis worship in Greece comes from aretalogies , poems in praise of the goddess . The wording of aretalogies from Maroneia and Andros , both from the first century BCE , closely links Isis with mystery rites . Petra <unk> says that these aretalogies prove the mysteries of Isis existed by that time , but Jan Bremmer argues that they only connect Isis with the Eleusinian Mysteries , not with distinctive rites of her own . Stronger evidence for mysteries of Isis is found in the first century CE , and they certainly existed in the second . Temples to Isis in Greece may have developed their mysteries in response to the widespread belief that the Greek mystery cults had originated with Isis and Osiris in Egypt . They could have adapted elements of Eleusinian rites , and perhaps Dionysian mysteries as well , to reflect Egyptian mythology . The end product would have seemed to the Greeks like an authentic Egyptian precursor to Greek mysteries . Many Greco @-@ Roman sources claim that Isis herself devised these rites . 
 Even once the mysteries were established , they were not performed everywhere Isis 's cult was present . The only known sites for her mystery cult were in Italy , Greece , and Anatolia , although she was worshipped in nearly every province of the Roman Empire . In Egypt itself , only a few texts and images from the Roman period refer to the mysteries of Isis , and it is not certain that they were ever performed there . 
 = = Apuleius 's description of the mysteries = = 
 = = = Context and reliability = = = 
 Several texts from Roman times refer to people who were initiated in the Isis cult . However , the only direct description of the mysteries of Isis comes from Metamorphoses , also known as The Golden Ass , a comic novel from the late second century CE by the Roman author Apuleius . 
 The novel 's protagonist is Lucius , a man who has been magically transformed into a donkey . In the eleventh and last book of the novel , Lucius , after falling asleep on the beach at Cenchreae in Greece , wakes to see the full moon . He prays to the moon , using the names of several moon goddesses known in the Greco @-@ Roman world , asking her to restore him to human form . Isis appears in a vision before Lucius and declares herself the greatest of all goddesses . She tells him that a festival in her honor , the <unk> <unk> , is taking place nearby , and that the festival procession carries with it garlands of roses that will restore his human form if he eats them . After Lucius becomes human again , the high priest at the festival declares that he has been saved from his misfortunes by the goddess , and that he will now be free of the inquisitiveness and self @-@ indulgence that drew him into many of his earlier misadventures . Lucius joins the local temple of Isis , becomes her devoted follower , and eventually undergoes initiation . 
 Lucius 's apparently solemn devotion to the Isis cult in this chapter contrasts strongly with the comic misadventures that make up the rest of the novel . Scholars debate whether the account is intended to seriously represent Lucius 's devotion to the goddess , or whether it is ironic , perhaps a satire of the Isis cult . Those who believe it is satirical point to the way Lucius is pushed to undergo several initiations , each requiring a fee , despite having little money . Although many of the scholars who have tried to analyze the mysteries based on the book have assumed it is serious , the book may be broadly accurate even if it is satirical . Apuleius 's description of the Isis cult and its mysteries generally fits with much of the outside evidence about them . S.J. Harrison says it shows " detailed knowledge of Egyptian cult , whether or not Apuleius himself was in fact an initiate of Isiac religion . " In another of his works , the Apologia , Apuleius claims to have undergone several initiations , though he does not mention the mysteries of Isis specifically . In writing Metamorphoses , he may have drawn on personal experience of the Isiac initiation or of other initiations that he underwent . Even so , the detailed description given in Metamorphoses may be idealized rather than strictly accurate , and the Isis cults may have included many varieties of mystery rite . The novel actually mentions three distinct initiation rites in two cities , although only the first is described in any detail . 
 = = = Rites = = = 
 According to Metamorphoses , the initiation " was performed in the manner of voluntary death and salvation obtained by favor . " Only Isis herself could determine who should be initiated and when ; thus , Lucius only begins preparing for the mysteries after Isis appears to him in a dream . The implication that Isis was thought to command her followers directly is supported by the Greek writer Pausanias , writing in the same era as Apuleius , who said no one was allowed to participate in Isis ' festivals in her shrine at <unk> without her inviting them in a dream , and by inscriptions in which priests of Isis write that she called them to become her servants . In Apuleius 's description , the goddess also determines how much the initiate must pay to the temple in order to undergo the rites . 
 The priests in Lucius 's initiation read the procedure for the rite from a ritual book kept in the temple that is covered in " undecipherable letters " , some of which are " forms of all kinds of animals " while others are ornate and abstract . The use of a book for ritual purposes was much more common in Egyptian religion than in Greek or Roman tradition , and the characters in them are often thought to be hieroglyphs or hieratic , which in the eyes of Greek and Roman worshippers would emphasize the Egyptian background of the rite and add to its solemnity . However , David Frankfurter suggests that they are akin to the deliberately unintelligible magical symbols that were commonly used in Greco @-@ Roman magic . 
 Before the initiation proper , Lucius must undergo a series of ritual purifications . The priest bathes him , asks the gods for forgiveness on his behalf , and sprinkles him with water . This confession of and repentance for past sins fits with an emphasis on chastity and other forms of self @-@ denial found in many other sources about the Isis cult . Lucius next has to wait ten days , while abstaining from meat and wine , before the initiation begins . Purifying baths were common in many rituals across the Greco @-@ Roman world . The plea for forgiveness , however , may derive from the oaths that Egyptian priests were required to take , in which they declared themselves to be free of wrongdoing . The sprinkling with water and the refraining from certain foods probably come from the purification rituals that those priests had to undergo before entering a temple . On the evening of the final day , Lucius receives a variety of gifts from fellow devotees of Isis before donning a clean linen robe and entering the deepest part of the temple . 
 The description of what happens next is deliberately cryptic . Lucius reminds the reader that the uninitiated are not allowed to know the details of the mystery rites , before describing his experience in vague terms . 
 I came to the boundary of death and , having trodden on the threshold of Proserpina , I travelled through all the elements and returned . In the middle of the night I saw the sun flashing with bright light , I came face to face with the gods below and the gods above and paid reverence to them from close at hand . 
 In a series of paradoxes , then , Lucius travels to the underworld and to the heavens , sees the sun amid darkness , and approaches the gods . Many people have speculated about how the ritual simulated these impossible experiences . The first sentence indicates that the initiate is supposed to be passing through the Greek underworld , but the surviving remains of Roman temples to Isis have no subterranean passages that might have simulated the underworld . The bright " sun " Lucius mentions may have been a fire in the darkness , similar to the one at the climax of the Eleusinian Mysteries . The gods he saw face to face may have been statues or frescoes of deities . Some scholars believe that the initiation also entailed some kind of reenactment of or reference to the death of Osiris , but if it did , Apuleius 's text does not mention it . 
 Lucius emerges from this experience in the morning , and the priests dress him in an elaborately embroidered cloak . He then stands on a dais carrying a torch and wearing a crown of palm leaves — " adorned like the sun and set up in the manner of a divine statue " , as Apuleius describes it . The priests draw back curtains to reveal Lucius to a crowd of his fellow devotees . During the next three days , Lucius enjoys a series of banquets and sacred meals with his fellow worshippers , completing the initiation process . 
 After this initiation , Lucius moves to Rome and joins its main temple to the goddess , the <unk> <unk> . Urged by more visions sent by the gods , he undergoes two more initiations , incurring more expenses — such as having to buy a replacement for the cloak he left behind at Cenchreae — each time . These initiations are not described in as much detail as the first . The second is dedicated to Osiris and is said to be different from the one dedicated to Isis . Apuleius calls it " the nocturnal ecstasies of the supreme god " but gives no other details . The third initiation may be dedicated to both Isis and Osiris . Before this initiation , Lucius has a vision where Osiris himself speaks to him , suggesting that he is the dominant figure in the rite . At the novel 's end Lucius has been admitted to a high position in the cult by Osiris himself , and he is confident that the god will ensure his future success in his work as a lawyer .

 = = = Religious symbolism and contact with the gods = = = 
 Most mystery rites were connected with myths about the deities they focused on — the Osiris myth , in the case of Isis — and they claimed to convey to initiates details about the myths that were not generally known . In addition , various Greco @-@ Roman writers produced theological and philosophical interpretations of the mysteries . Spurred by the fragmentary evidence , modern scholars have often tried to discern what the mysteries may have meant to their initiates . But Hugh Bowden argues that there may have been no single , authoritative interpretation of mystery rites and that " the desire to identify a lost secret — something that , once it is correctly identified , will explain what a mystery cult was all about — is bound to fail . " He regards the effort to meet the gods directly , exemplified by the climax of Lucius 's initiation in Metamorphoses , as the most important feature of the rites . The notion of meeting the gods face to face contrasted with classical Greek and Roman beliefs , in which seeing the gods , though it might be an awe @-@ inspiring experience , could be dangerous and even deadly . In Greek mythology , for example , the sight of Zeus 's true form incinerated the mortal woman Semele . Yet Lucius 's meeting with the gods fits with a trend , found in various religious groups in Roman times , toward a closer connection between the worshipper and the gods . 
 Ancient Egyptian beliefs are one possible source for understanding the symbolism in the mysteries of Isis . J. Gwyn Griffiths , an Egyptologist and classical scholar , extensively studied Book 11 of Metamorphoses and its possible Egyptian background . He pointed out similarities between the first initiation in Metamorphoses and Egyptian afterlife beliefs , saying that the initiate took on the role of Osiris by undergoing symbolic death . In his view , the imagery of the initiation refers to the Egyptian underworld , the Duat . Griffiths argued that the sun in the middle of the night , in Lucius ' account of the initiation , might have been influenced by the contrasts of light and dark in other mystery rites , but it derived mainly from the depictions of the underworld in ancient Egyptian funerary texts . According to these texts , the sun god Ra passes through the underworld each night and unites with Osiris to emerge renewed , just as deceased souls do . 
 The " elements " that Lucius passes through in the first initiation may refer to the classical elements of earth , air , water , and fire that were believed to make up the world , or to regions of the cosmos . In either case , it indicates that Lucius 's vision transports him beyond the human world . <unk> <unk> believes the word refers specifically to the planets in Hellenistic astrology . Astrological themes appeared in many other cults in the Roman Empire , including another mystery cult , dedicated to Mithras . In the Isis cult , astrological symbolism may have alluded to the belief that Isis governed the movements of the stars and thus the passage of time and the order of the cosmos , beliefs that Lucius refers to when praying to the goddess . 
 However , in the course of the book , as Valentino Gasparini puts it , " Osiris explicitly snatches out of Isis 's hands the role of Supreme Being " and replaces her as the focus of Lucius 's devotion . Osiris ' prominence in the Metamorphoses is in keeping with other evidence about the Isis cult in Rome , which suggests that it adopted more themes and imagery from Egyptian funerary religion and the worship of Osiris in the late 1st and early 2nd centuries CE . Gasparini argues that the shift in focus reflects a belief that Osiris was the supreme being and Isis was an intermediary between him and humanity . This interpretation is found in the book On Isis and Osiris by the first @-@ century CE Greek author Plutarch , which analyzes the Osiris myth based on Plutarch 's own Middle Platonist philosophy . However , S.J. Harrison suggests that the sudden switch of focus from Isis to Osiris is simply a satire of grandiose claims of religious devotion . 
 = = = Commitment to the cult = = = 
 Because not all local cults of Isis held mystery rites , not all her devotees would have undergone initiation . Nevertheless , both Apuleius 's story and Plutarch 's On Isis and Osiris suggest that initiation was considered part of the larger process of joining the cult and dedicating oneself to the goddess . 
 The Isis cult , like most in the Greco @-@ Roman world , was not exclusive ; worshippers of Isis could continue to revere other gods as well . Devotees of Isis were among the very few religious groups in the Greco @-@ Roman world to have a distinctive name for themselves , loosely equivalent to " Jew " or " Christian " , that might indicate they defined themselves by their exclusive devotion to the goddess . However , the word — <unk> or " Isiac " — was rarely used . Many priests of Isis officiated in other cults as well . Several people in late Roman times , like Vettius <unk> <unk> , joined multiple priesthoods and underwent several initiations dedicated to different gods . Mystery initiations thus did not require devotees to abandon whatever religious identity they originally had , and they would not qualify as religious conversions under a narrow definition of the term . However , some of these initiations did involve smaller changes in religious identity , such as joining a new community of worshippers or strengthening devotees ' commitment to a cult they were already part of , that would qualify as conversions in a broader sense . Many ancient sources , both written by <unk> and by outside observers , suggest that many of Isis 's devotees considered her the focus of their lives and that the cult emphasized moral purity , self @-@ denial , and public declarations of devotion to the goddess . Joining Isis 's cult was therefore a sharper change in identity than in many other mystery cults . Isiac initiation , by giving the devotee a dramatic , mystical experience of the goddess , added emotional intensity to the process . 
 It is unclear how initiation may have affected a devotee 's rank within the cult . After going through his third initiation , Lucius becomes a <unk> , a member of a particular class of priests . If the third initiation was a requirement for becoming a <unk> , it is possible that members moved up in the cult hierarchy by going through the series of initiations . Nevertheless , Apuleius refers to initiates and to priests as if they are separate groups within the cult . Initiation may have been a prerequisite for a devotee to become a priest but not have automatically made him or her into one . 
 = = = Connection with the afterlife = = = 
 Many pieces of evidence suggest that the mysteries of Isis were connected in some way to salvation and the guarantee of an afterlife . The Greek conception of the afterlife included the <unk> Elysian Fields , and philosophers developed various ideas about the immortality of the soul , but Greeks and Romans expressed uncertainty about what would happen to them after death . In both Greek and Roman traditional religion , no god was thought to guarantee a pleasant afterlife to his or her worshippers . The gods of some mystery cults may have been exceptions , but evidence about those cults ' afterlife beliefs is vague . Apuleius 's account , if it is accurate , provides stronger evidence for Isiac afterlife beliefs than is available for the other cults . The book says Isis 's power over fate , which her Greek and Roman devotees frequently mentioned , gives her control over life and death . According to the priest who initiates Lucius , devotees of Isis " who had finished their life 's span and were already standing on the threshold of light ’ s end , if only they could safely be trusted with the great unspoken mysteries of the cult , were frequently drawn forth by the goddess ' power and in a manner reborn through her providence and set once more on the course of renewed life . " In another passage , Isis herself says that when Lucius dies he will be able to see her shining in the darkness of the underworld and worship her there . 
 Some scholars are skeptical the afterlife was a major focus of the cult . Ramsay MacMullen says that when characters in Metamorphoses call Lucius " reborn " , they refers to his new life as a devotee and never call him <unk> in aeternam [ eternally reborn ] , which would refer to the afterlife . Mary Beard , John North , and Simon Price say Metamorphoses shows that " the cult of Isis had implications for life and death , but even so more emphasis is placed on extending the span of life than on the after @-@ life — which is pictured in fairly undifferentiated terms . " 
 A funerary inscription from Bithynia , left by a devotee of Isis , provides evidence of Isiac afterlife beliefs outside Apuleius 's work . It explicitly says that because the devotee was initiated into the mysteries of the goddess , he did not " walk the dark road of the Acheron " but " ran to the havens of the blessed . " 
 Afterlife beliefs in the Isis cult were probably connected with Osiris . The ancient Egyptians believed that Osiris lived on in the Duat after death , thanks in part to Isis 's help , and that after their deaths they could be revived like him with the assistance of other deities , including Isis . These beliefs may well have carried over into the Greco @-@ Roman Isis cult . The symbolism found in Lucius 's first initiation , with its references to death and to the sun in the Egyptian underworld , suggests that it involved <unk> afterlife beliefs , even though Osiris is not mentioned in the description of the rite . As Robert Turcan puts it , when Lucius is revealed to the crowd after his initiation he is " honoured almost like a new Osiris , saved and regenerated through the ineffable powers of Isis . The palms radiating from his head were the signs of the Sun triumphing over death . " 
 = = Influence on other traditions = = 
 = = = Possible influence on Christianity = = = 
 The mysteries of Isis , like those of other gods , continued to be performed into the late fourth century CE . Toward the end of the century , however , Christian emperors increasingly restricted the practice of non @-@ Christian religions , which they condemned as " pagan " . Mystery cults thus died out near the start of the fifth century . They existed alongside Christianity for centuries before their extinction , and some elements of their initiations resembled Christian beliefs and practices . As a result , the possibility has often been raised that Christianity was directly influenced by the mystery cults . Evidence about interactions between Christianity and the mystery cults is poor , making the question difficult to resolve . 
 Most religious traditions in the Greco @-@ Roman world centered on a particular city or ethnic group and did not require personal devotion , only public ritual . In contrast , the cult of Isis , like Christianity and some other mystery cults , was made up of people who joined voluntarily , out of their personal commitment to a deity that many of them regarded as superior to all others . Christianity has its own initiation ritual , baptism , and beginning in the fourth century , Christians began to refer to their sacraments , like baptism , with the word <unk> , the Greek term that was also used for a mystery rite . In this case , the word meant that Christians did not discuss their most important rites with non @-@ Christians who might misunderstand or disrespect them . Their rites thus acquired some of the aura of secrecy that surrounded the mystery cults . Furthermore , if Isiac initiates were thought to benefit in the afterlife from Osiris 's death and resurrection , this belief would parallel the Christian belief that the death and resurrection of Jesus make salvation available to those who become Christians . 
 Even in ancient times these similarities were controversial . Non @-@ Christians in the Roman Empire in the early centuries CE thought Christianity and the mystery cults resembled each other . Reacting to these claims by outsiders , early Christian apologists denied that these cults had influenced their religion . The 17th @-@ century Protestant scholar Isaac Casaubon brought up the question again by accusing the Catholic Church of deriving its sacraments from the rituals of the mystery cults . Charles @-@ François Dupuis , in the late 18th century , went further by claiming that all Christianity originated in the mystery cults . Intensified by religious disputes between Protestants , Catholics , and non @-@ Christians , the controversy has continued to the present day . 
 Some scholars have specifically compared baptism with the Isiac initiation described by Apuleius . Before the early fourth century CE , baptism was the culmination of a long process , in which the convert to Christianity fasted for the forty days of Lent before being immersed at Easter in a cistern or natural body of water . Like the mysteries of Isis , then , early Christian baptism involved a days @-@ long fast and a washing ritual . Both fasting and washing were common types of ritual purification found in the religions of the Mediterranean , and Christian baptism was specifically derived from the baptism of Jesus and Jewish immersion rituals . Therefore , according to Hugh Bowden , these similarities come from the shared religious background of Christianity and the Isis cult , not from the influence of one tradition upon the other . 
 Similarly , the sacred meals shared by the initiates of many mystery cults have been compared with the Christian rite of communion . For instance , the classicist R. E. Witt called the banquet that concluded the Isiac initiation " the pagan Eucharist of Isis and Sarapis " . However , feasts in which worshippers ate the food that had been sacrificed to a deity were a nearly universal practice in Mediterranean religions and do not prove a direct link between Christianity and the mystery cults . The most distinctive trait of Christian communion — the belief that the god himself was the victim of the sacrifice — was not present in the mystery cults . 
 Bowden doubts that afterlife beliefs were a very important aspect of mystery cults and therefore thinks their resemblance to Christianity was small . Jaime Alvar , in contrast , argues that the mysteries of Isis , along with those of Mithras and Cybele , did involve beliefs about salvation and the afterlife that resembled those in Christianity . But , he says , they did not become similar by borrowing directly from each other , only by adapting in similar ways to the Greco @-@ Roman religious environment . He says : " Each cult found the materials it required in the common trough of current ideas . Each took what it needed and adapted these elements according to its overall drift and design . " 
 = = = Influence in modern times = = = 
 Motifs from Apuleius ' description of the Isiac initiation have been repeated and reworked in fiction and in esoteric belief systems in modern times , and they thus form an important part of the Western perception of ancient Egyptian religion . People reusing these motifs often assume that mystery rites were practiced in Egypt long before Hellenistic times . 
 An influential example is the 1731 novel Sethos by Jean Terrasson . Terrasson claimed he had translated this book from an ancient Greek work of fiction that was based on real events . The book was actually his own invention , inspired by ancient Greek sources that assumed Greek philosophy had derived from Egypt . In the novel , Egypt 's priests run an elaborate education system like a European university . To join their ranks , the protagonist , Sethos , undergoes an initiation presided over by Isis , taking place in hidden chambers beneath the Great Pyramid of Giza . Based on Lucius ' statement in Metamorphoses that he was " borne through all the elements " during his initiation , Terrasson describes the initiation as an elaborate series of ordeals , each based on one of the classical elements : running over hot metal bars for fire , swimming a canal for water , and swinging through the air over a pit . 
 William Warburton 's treatise The Divine Legation of Moses , published from 1738 to 1741 , included an analysis of ancient mystery rites that drew upon Sethos for much of its evidence . Assuming that all mystery rites derived from Egypt , Warburton argued that the public face of Egyptian religion was polytheistic , but the Egyptian mysteries were designed to reveal a deeper , monotheistic truth to elite initiates . One of them , Moses , learned this truth during his Egyptian upbringing and developed Judaism to reveal it to the entire Israelite nation . 
 Freemasons , members of a European fraternal organization that attained its modern form in the early eighteenth century , developed many pseudohistorical origin myths that traced Freemasonry back to ancient times . Egypt was among the civilizations that Masons claimed had influenced their traditions . After Sethos was published , several Masonic lodges developed rites based on those in the novel . Late in the century , Masonic writers , still assuming that Sethos was an ancient story , used the obvious resemblance between their rites and the initiation of Sethos as evidence of Freemasonry 's supposedly ancient origin . Many works of fiction from the 1790s to the 1820s reused and modified the signature traits of Terrasson 's Egyptian initiation : trials by three or four elements , often taking place under the pyramids . The best @-@ known of these works is Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart 's 1791 opera The Magic Flute , in which the main character , <unk> , undergoes a series of trials overseen by priests who invoke Isis and Osiris . 
 The Freemason Karl Leonhard Reinhold , in the 1780s , drew upon and modified Warburton 's claims in an effort to reconcile Freemasonry 's traditional origin story , which traces Freemasonry back to ancient Israel , with its enthusiasm for Egyptian imagery . He claimed that the sentence " I am that I am " , spoken by the Jewish God in the Book of Exodus , had a pantheistic meaning . He compared it with an Egyptian inscription on a veiled statue of Isis recorded by the Roman @-@ era authors Plutarch and Proclus , which said " I am all that is , was , and shall be , " which led him to believe that Isis was a pantheistic personification of Nature . According to Reinhold , it was this pantheistic belief system that Moses imparted to the Israelites , so that Isis and the Jewish and Christian conception of God shared a common origin . 
 In contrast , some people in the wake of the <unk> of France during the French Revolution used the imagery of a pantheistic Isis to represent their opposition to the clergy and to Christianity in general . For instance , an esoteric fraternal organization in Napoleonic France , the <unk> Order , regarded Isis as their tutelary deity . To them , she symbolized both modern scientific knowledge — which hoped to uncover Nature 's secrets — and the mystical wisdom of the ancient mystery rites . The vague set of esoteric beliefs that surrounded the goddess offered an alternative to traditional Christianity . It was during this anticlerical era that Dupuis claimed that Christianity was a distorted offshoot of ancient mystery cults . 
 Various esoteric organizations that emerged in the late 19th and early 20th centuries , such as the Theosophical Society and the Ancient and Mystical Order <unk> Crucis , repeated the beliefs that had originated with Sethos : that Egyptians underwent initiation within the pyramids and that Greek philosophers were initiates who learned Egypt 's secret wisdom . Esoteric writers influenced by Theosophy , such as Reuben Swinburne Clymer in his 1909 book The Mystery of Osiris and Manly Palmer Hall in Freemasonry of the Ancient Egyptians in 1937 , also wrote of an age @-@ old Egyptian mystery tradition . An elaborate example of these beliefs is the 1954 book Stolen Legacy by George James , which claims that Greek philosophy was built on knowledge stolen from the Egyptian school of initiates . James imagined this mystery school as a grandiose organization with branches on many continents , so that the purported system of Egyptian mysteries shaped cultures all over the world . 
 = Aspmyra Stadion = 
 Aspmyra Stadion is a football stadium in Bodø , Norway . Home of Bodø / Glimt and Grand Bodø , it holds a capacity for 7 @,@ 354 spectators . The venue has three stands : a modern all @-@ seater with roof , 100 club seats and 15 luxury boxes to the south , an unroofed all @-@ seater to the east and an older grandstand with mixed sitting and standing to the north . The venue has floodlights and artificial turf with under @-@ soil heating . Immediately south of the venue lies Aspmyra <unk> , a training pitch with artificial turf . Aspmyra Stadion has hosted one Norway national football team match , against Iceland in 2002 . 
 The venue opened in 1966 as a municipal multi @-@ purpose stadium which included a running track . Glimt reached the top @-@ flight in 1977 , and played Cup Winners ' Cup matches in the late 1970s at Aspmyra . The venue had a slight upgrade in 1980 , which also saw the laying of all @-@ weather running track and the construction of the training pitch . In 1992 , the pitch was <unk> , forcing Glimt to play a season in Nordlandshallen , which since has been used twice for Norwegian Premier League matches . Aspmyra Stadion was sold to Glimt in 1997 , followed by the construction of the south and east stands . This involved removing the running track and building commercial and residential properties around the venue . Artificial turf was laid in 2006 . After the club received illegal public subsidies in 2008 had to upgrade the venue , it was in 2011 sold back to the municipality .

 After the establishment of Bodø / <unk> in 1916 and Grand Bodø the following year , the clubs played at various locations throughout the town . The primary venue for the clubs ' elite teams was Bodø Station . By 1962 , plans had surfaced for a central stadium for the prime sports clubs . The interest spurred a large protest meeting organized by the various sports clubs in town in support of the municipality building a new venue . Two locations were considered : at <unk> , now the location of the Norwegian Aviation Museum , and at Aspmyra . The latter was chosen and the plans were passed by the municipal council in 1963 . 
 Construction started in 1965 , with the completion of a grass pitch , a 400 @-@ meter ( 1 @,@ 300 ft ) running track and a grandstand consisting of wooden benches for 2 @,@ 500 spectators . Steel terraces were built on the outer parts of the grandstand site and the other long side . To the south of the stadium , Glimt built an air @-@ supported training hall , which they named <unk> ( ' The Glimt Bubble ' ) . The inaugural match at Aspmyra was played in 1966 between the boys ' teams of Glimt and Grand in 1966 . In 1980 , an all @-@ weather running track was installed and a training pitch with artificial turf , named Aspmyra <unk> , was built south of the stadium . 
 In 1989 , a project was started to bring Bodø / Glimt back to the top league . Among the most important issues was to secure better training facilities , particularly during the Arctic winter . The club proposed upgrading the artificial turf field at Aspmyra with a new field with under @-@ soil heating , in addition to constructing both a new gravel pitch and an indoor training hall with a full @-@ size pitch . The Municipal Committee for Sport and Culture stated that they wanted to prioritize the artificial turf field over a gravel pitch . They therefore proposed that NOK 3 @.@ 5 million be allocated to lay under @-@ soil heating on the artificial turf pitch and remove the turf . New artificial turf would be laid at a later date , when funding could be allocated . This was agreed upon , construction started on 24 October 1989 and was scheduled for completion ahead of the winter training . However , the Football Association of Norway ( NFF ) stated that the club would not be allowed to play their matches on a gravel pitch , and the grass at Aspmyra was in so bad condition that it would not be permitted for play in the top league , should the team be promoted . The municipal council therefore gave grants to finance a new artificial turf on the training pitch , which was taken into use in 1990 . 
 Construction of Nordlandshallen — an indoor football venue for winter training — started in 1990 and was completed on 21 September 1991 . In 1991 , the debate regarding laying a new pitch at the stadium resurfaced . NFF granted permission for Glimt to use Nordlandshallen for the 1992 season , on condition that Aspmyra was ready for use for the 1993 season . The municipality lacked funds for a new pitch , so the parties agreed that the club would borrow NOK 3 @.@ 5 million to pay for the renovation . The club would pay the interest on the loan until it was taken over by the municipality , but until then , Bodø / Glimt would not pay rent on the stadium . If the municipality was to finance the renovation in a regular manner , funds could not be allocated until the following year , which would cause two seasons to be lost . The new pitch included under @-@ soil heating . 
 In 1994 , Bodø / Glimt started making plans to expand Aspmyra to allow it to host UEFA matches . The company Aspmyra Eiendomsutvikling was established to finance the project and own the stands . Details were presented in 1996 , which consisted of the company being given the Aspmyra lot , worth NOK 15 million , from the municipality . The initial plans called for seated stands for 10 @,@ 000 spectators — a quarter of the town 's population — 48 apartments and 15 @,@ 000 square meters ( 160 @,@ 000 sq ft ) of commercial property . Funding was proposed to come from selling the residential and commercial properties and grants from NFF and the Ministry of Culture . The project also included new floodlights and a new club house . The municipal chief of administration , Svein Blix , stated that the project would also have to pay for the operation of the new venue and the construction of a new athletics venue , as the plans called to remove the running tracks at Aspmyra . 
 The municipality gave the necessary permissions for construction in December 1997 , but required that the club finance the upgrades , which the club could not afford . Kjell Ove Johansen , CEO of Bodø / Glimt 's operating company , quit his job in November 1998 in protest against the mayor 's and councilors ' negative attitude and lack of trust towards Bodø / Glimt regarding the venue plans . On 27 January 1999 , the municipal council passed a resolution allowing the venue to be sold to the club for NOK 7 @.@ 9 million , with the official take @-@ over date being 1 May . In addition , the company would pay NOK 5 @.@ 5 million to the municipality at a later date , after the venue had become profitable . 
 Construction started in October 1999 , costing NOK 140 million . A new south stand was built with a roof , offices and change rooms , while a smaller stand without a roof was built to the east . The project cost NOK 40 million less than the original plans , in part because no stands were built on the west end . The two new stands had 4 @,@ 350 seats and the venue was approved for UEFA matches . However , the venue was not allowed to use the old grandstand seating or the terraces for UEFA matches . The two new stands gave the stadium seating for 6 @,@ 100 and standing room for 2 @,@ 000 spectators . The first match at the upgraded venue was played on 22 April 2001 . 
 The project also included 6 @,@ 900 square meters ( 74 @,@ 000 sq ft ) of commercial property , which was rented out to 13 companies . The commercial part of the stadium was owned by Aspmyra Næringsbygg , which was again owned by several local investors . The stadium received new floodlights , which were bought used from Ullevaal Stadion in Oslo for NOK 5 million . However , there were some initial complaints from Bodø Airport as the lights were a distraction for pilots . The club also considered installing artificial turf , and applied to be UEFA 's partner to receive a grant to install a pilot turf , but this was instead awarded to <unk> in Sweden . On 2 December 2002 , <unk> bought a third of the shares in Aspmyra Eiendomsutvikling from the club , for NOK 10 million , to avoid that the club went bankrupt . In 2003 , Bodø / Glimt 's spent NOK 650 @,@ 000 on rent and NOK 700 @,@ 000 in operating costs for the venue . 
 As compensation for removing the track and field sections , the stadium company had to pay for a new municipal athletics venue at <unk> . The sales stadium 's contract also required Aspmyra Eiendomsutvikling to build new change room facilities for the training pitch so the uses from teams had the same quality as the main pitch . The company was criticized by the municipality in 2002 for not prioritizing this obligation . The NOK 170 @,@ 000 it cost to move Grand 's club house and build a change room for the artificial field was covered jointly by the municipality , Grand , Aspmyra Eiendomsutvikling and one of Glimt 's sponsors , Nordland Entreprenør . 
 In 2003 , Aspmyra <unk> converted its debt , then NOK 20 @.@ 5 million , to Swiss francs . Because of the transaction , within a year the company 's debt had increased by 10 percent . In 2004 , the stadium ownership company changed its name to Aspmyra Stadion AS . The municipality eliminated the stadium company 's debt of NOK 5 @.@ 5 million to the municipality in November 2005 . This allowed the club 's operating company to have a positive share capital and the club was thus allowed to keep its license . In May 2006 , the grass pitch was replaced with artificial pitch , costing NOK 3 @.@ 1 million . The training pitch received new turf in 2007 . 
 Following Glimt 's promotion to the top league in 2008 , the club stated that Aspmyra was " out of date " and that investments for NOK 200 million was necessary if the club was to remain in the top tier . Chair Benn <unk> stated that while Aspmyra was among the country 's most modern venues in 2001 , it would within a few years no longer be in the top @-@ 25 . He identified funding from regionally differentiated payroll tax ( DA @-@ funds ) , public grants and funding for sponsors as the main sources of financing . <unk> upgrades to the venue for NOK 10 million were done ahead of the 2008 season — financed using DA @-@ funds . It consisted of two specific grants , a NOK 2 @.@ 2 million subsidy and a ten @-@ year NOK 8 @.@ 3 million interest and installment @-@ free loan , both to the club . In 2009 , the bank deleted NOK 5 million of the stadium debt , reducing it to NOK 14 @.@ 2 million . 
 In 2009 , Innovation Norway criticized Nordland County Municipality , who administrated the DA @-@ funds , stating that both the grant and load to Glimt were illegal . Therefore , both were converted to an interest @-@ bearing loan and were issued to Aspmyra Stadion instead of the club . The club is required to have positive equity to keep its license to play in the top two tiers . Because it was the majority shareholder of the stadium company , it filed consolidated accounts which also include the equity of Aspmyra Stadion AS . Thus , the consequence of Innovation Norway 's proceedings was that the club risked ending up with a negative equity and could be relegated to the third tier . To secure it retained a positive equity , Glimt proposed selling the venue to the municipality . 
 The municipal council voted on 17 February 2011 to purchase the stadium . The strongest proponents were the Labour Party and the Conservative Party , while three parties , the Progress Party , the Liberal Party and Red Party , voted against . The proponents argued that municipality was purchasing the venue with a much higher value than what they had sold , while the opponents argued that it was not the municipality 's responsibility to give financial first @-@ aid to a professional sports club . The cost was NOK 16 million , paid for by taking over debt . After taking over the stadium company , the municipality merged it with Bodø Spektrum , which runs an indoor sports complex , including Nordlandshallen . This allows the debt to be taken over by the municipality without interfering with the municipal accounts .

 The venue is located in the southern part of the town center of Bodø , on <unk> , close to Bodø Airport . The venue has a capacity for 7 @,@ 354 spectators . The South Stand has 15 luxury boxes , each with seating for 12 people , and club seating for an additional 100 people in Aspmyra <unk> ; this is only available for corporate sponsors . Both the sports bar and the boxes have access to dinners before the match . The stand is combined with a commercial and residential building , which is owned by Aspmyra Næringsbygg , which is again controlled by <unk> Johansen . Bodø / Glimt 's offices are located in this section , which along with the public access is rented by Glimt . Of sponsorship reasons , the South Stand is named for Diadora . 
 The North Stand is the oldest part of the venue and is owned by Aspmyra AS . For sponsorship reasons , it is named after <unk> . The area behind the East Stand was bought by Bodø <unk> , who built housing there and is named after Toyota , again for sponsorship reasons . In 2010 , the operating costs of the venue were NOK 2 million .

 Bodø / Glimt are the main tenant at Aspmyra . The record attendance dates from 1975 , when 12 @,@ 189 people attended a Norwegian Football Cup match against Viking . From the 1977 season , Bodø / Glimt played in the First Division , then the top tier of the pyramid . The club remained in to the top flight until it was relegated after the 1980 season . Glimt had a poor spell during the 1980s , playing several seasons in the Third Division . On 5 October 1986 , Aspmyra hosted the final of the Junior Football Cup between Bodø / Glimt and Lillestrøm . At the end of 1991 , Glimt was promoted to the First Division , then the second tier of the pyramid . However , in the 1992 season , the club played at Nordlandshallen . From the 1993 season , Bodø / Glimt again played in the top flight . Twice , in 1993 and 1997 , the final match of the season had to be played in Nordlandshallen because of the poor condition of the turf . Following the installation of floodlights in 2001 , the attendance increased by 70 percent at <unk> evening games , resulting in an increase in the use of evening matches during the spring and fall . Glimt remained in the Premier League until the end of the 2005 season , when they were relegated . They returned again for the 2008 season , but were relegated after the 2009 seasons . 
 Aspmyra was used for UEFA Cup Winners ' Cup matches in the late 1970s . Bodø / Glimt played Napoli in 1976 – 77 , and Union Luxembourg and Internazionale in 1978 – 79 . During the 1990s , Bodø / Glimt was allowed to play qualification matches for UEFA tournaments at Aspmyra , but the venue was not suitable for games in the ordinary rounds because of lack of floodlights . In the 1994 – 95 Cup Winners ' Cup , Glimt played Olimpija Rīga at Aspmyra , but had to play against Sampdoria at Ullevaal Stadion . The team 's 1996 – 97 UEFA Cup match against Trabzonspor was played at Ullevaal , although the qualification match against <unk> Jerusalem had been played at Aspmyra . Similarly , in the 1999 – 2000 UEFA Cup , the qualification against Vaduz was played at Aspmyra , while the first round match against Werder Bremen was played at Lerkendal Stadion in Trondheim . With an upgraded venue , Bodø / Glimt was again allowed to play all their home matches in UEFA tournaments at Aspmyra . In the 2004 – 05 UEFA Cup , Bodø / Glimt was visited by <unk> Tallinn and Beşiktaş . 
 In addition to Bodø / Glimt , Grand Bodø also plays matches at Aspmyra . This includes their women 's team , which has previously played in the Women 's Premier League . They most recently played in the top league in 2007 , when they drew an average 222 spectators . During the 1980s , Grand 's men 's club became the town 's best , playing in the Second Division , the tier above Glimt . 
 The venue hosted the Norwegian Athletics Championships in 1980 . The following year , it held the women 's semi @-@ final in the 1981 European Cup in Athletics . Aspmyra has hosted one Norway national football team match , which resulted in 1 – 1 against Iceland and filling the venue with 8 @,@ 126 spectators on 22 May 2002 . This still stands as the venue 's record attendance after the rebuilding . In August 2007 , the Norwegian women 's U @-@ 23 team played Sweden at Aspmyra .

 In 2008 , the club stated that they would either have to renovate Aspmyra for NOK 200 million or build a new stadium elsewhere to remain competitive at a premiership level . Funding was proposed to be a mix of public and sponsor grants , including DA @-@ funds . As part of the planning of a joint Norwegian and Swedish bid for the Euro 2016 , Bodø Municipality and Bodø / Glimt proposed that Bodø could build a stadium at <unk> , in the northern part of the town . The plans were presented in late July 2008 ; the venue was planned to have a capacity for 30 @,@ 000 to 35 @,@ 000 spectators , but would be rebuilt after the tournament to seat 10 @,@ 000 to 15 @,@ 000 . It was estimated that Bodø / Glimt would need a capacity for 10 @,@ 000 to 15 @,@ 000 spectators . In comparison , the population of Bodø was 46 @,@ 049 in 2008 . The new venue was estimated to cost NOK 500 to 700 million and was largely proposed financed with DA @-@ funds . Minister of Culture , Trond <unk> , stated that at least one of the venues would have to be in Northern Norway to receive government support for an application . Aspmyra was planned used as a training pitch . Bodø was discarded for the Scandinavian bid , which ultimately was never sent to UEFA . For Aspmyra , the municipality has stated that they have the long @-@ term option to purchase the real estate north of the pitch and can build a new stand there . Alternatively , an estimated NOK 3 million can be used to demolish the stand and redevelop it as a commercial property . 
 = Afroyim v. Rusk = 
 Afroyim v. Rusk , 387 U.S. 253 ( 1967 ) , is a major United States Supreme Court case in which the Court ruled that citizens of the United States may not be deprived of their citizenship involuntarily . The U.S. government had attempted to revoke the citizenship of Beys Afroyim , a man born in Poland , because he had cast a vote in an Israeli election after becoming a naturalized U.S. citizen . The Supreme Court decided that Afroyim 's right to retain his citizenship was guaranteed by the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution . In so doing , the Court overruled one of its own precedents , Perez v. Brownell ( 1958 ) , in which it had upheld loss of citizenship under similar circumstances less than a decade earlier . 
 The Afroyim decision opened the way for a wider acceptance of dual ( or multiple ) citizenship in United States law . The Bancroft Treaties — a series of agreements between the United States and other nations which had sought to limit dual citizenship following naturalization — were eventually abandoned after the Carter administration concluded that Afroyim and other Supreme Court decisions had rendered them unenforceable . 
 The impact of Afroyim v. Rusk was narrowed by a later case , Rogers v. Bellei ( 1971 ) , in which the Court determined that the Fourteenth Amendment safeguarded citizenship only when a person was born or naturalized in the United States , and that Congress retained authority to regulate the citizenship status of a person who was born outside the United States to an American parent . However , the specific law at issue in Rogers v. Bellei — a requirement for a minimum period of U.S. residence that Bellei had failed to satisfy — was repealed by Congress in 1978 . As a consequence of revised policies adopted in 1990 by the United States Department of State , it is now ( in the words of one expert ) " virtually impossible to lose American citizenship without formally and expressly renouncing it . " 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Early history of United States citizenship law = = = 
 Citizenship in the United States has historically been acquired in one of three ways : by birth in the United States ( jus soli , " right of the soil " ) ; by birth outside the United States to an American parent ( jus sanguinis , " right of the blood " ) ; or by immigration to the United States followed by naturalization . 
 In 1857 , the Supreme Court held in Dred Scott v. Sandford that African slaves , former slaves , and their descendants were not eligible to be citizens . After the Civil War ( 1861 – 65 ) and the resulting abolition of slavery in the United States , steps were taken to grant citizenship to the freed slaves . Congress first enacted the Civil Rights Act of 1866 , which included a clause declaring " all persons born in the United States and not subject to any foreign power " to be citizens . Even as the Civil Rights Act was being debated in Congress , its opponents argued that the citizenship provision was unconstitutional . In light of this concern , as well as to protect the new grant of citizenship for former slaves from being repealed by a later Congress , the drafters of the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution included a Citizenship Clause , which would entrench in the Constitution ( and thereby set beyond the future reach of Congress or the courts ) a guarantee of citizenship stating that " All persons born or naturalized in the United States , and subject to the jurisdiction thereof , are citizens of the United States " . The Fourteenth Amendment — including the Citizenship Clause — was ratified by state legislatures and became a part of the Constitution in 1868 . 
 = = = Loss of United States citizenship = = = 
 The Constitution does not specifically deal with loss of citizenship . An amendment proposed by Congress in 1810 — the Titles of Nobility Amendment — would , if ratified , have provided that any citizen who accepted any " present , pension , office or emolument " from a foreign country , without the consent of Congress , would " cease to be a citizen of the United States " ; however , this amendment was never ratified by a sufficient number of state legislatures and , as a result , never became a part of the Constitution . 
 Ever since the affirmation by Congress , in the <unk> Act of 1868 , that individuals had an inherent right to expatriation ( giving up of citizenship ) , it has historically been accepted that certain actions could result in loss of citizenship . This possibility was noted by the Supreme Court in United States v. Wong Kim Ark , an 1898 case involving a man born in the United States to Chinese parents who were legally domiciled in the country . After ruling in this case that Wong was born a U.S. citizen despite his Chinese ancestry , the Court went on to state that his birthright citizenship " [ had ] not been lost or taken away by anything happening since his birth . " 
 The Nationality Act of 1940 provided for loss of citizenship based on foreign military or government service , when coupled with citizenship in that foreign country . This statute also mandated loss of citizenship for desertion from the U.S. armed forces , remaining outside the United States in order to evade military service during wartime , or voting in a foreign election . The provision calling for loss of citizenship for foreign military service was held by the Supreme Court not to be enforceable without proof that said service had been voluntary , in a 1958 case ( Nishikawa v. Dulles ) , and revocation of citizenship as a punishment for desertion was struck down that same year in another case ( Trop v. Dulles ) . 
 However , in yet another 1958 case ( Perez v. Brownell ) , the Supreme Court affirmed the provision revoking the citizenship of any American who had voted in an election in a foreign country , as a legitimate exercise ( under the Constitution 's Necessary and Proper Clause ) of Congress ' authority to regulate foreign affairs and avoid potentially embarrassing diplomatic situations . Associate Justice Felix Frankfurter , the author of the opinion of the Court ( supported by a 5 – 4 majority ) , wrote that : 
 ... the activities of the citizens of one nation when in another country can easily cause serious embarrassments to the government of their own country as well as to their fellow citizens . We cannot deny to Congress the reasonable belief that these difficulties might well become acute , to the point of jeopardizing the successful conduct of international relations , when a citizen of one country chooses to participate in the political or governmental affairs of another country . The citizen may by his action unwittingly promote or encourage a course of conduct contrary to the interests of his own government ; moreover , the people or government of the foreign country may regard his action to be the action of his government , or at least as a reflection if not an expression of its policy .... It follows that such activity is <unk> by Congress under its power to deal with foreign affairs . 
 In a dissenting opinion , Chief Justice Earl Warren argued that " Citizenship is man 's basic right , for it is nothing less than the right to have rights " and that " a government of the people cannot take away their citizenship simply because one branch of that government can be said to have a conceivably rational basis for wanting to do so . " While Warren was willing to allow for loss of citizenship as a result of foreign naturalization or other actions " by which [ an American ] manifests allegiance to a foreign state [ which ] may be so inconsistent with the retention of [ U.S. ] citizenship as to result in loss of that status " , he wrote that " In specifying that any act of voting in a foreign political election results in loss of citizenship , Congress has employed a classification so broad that it encompasses conduct that fails to show a voluntary abandonment of American citizenship . " 
 Two Supreme Court decisions after Perez called into question the principle that loss of citizenship could occur even without the affected individual 's intent . In Kennedy v. Mendoza @-@ Martinez ( 1963 ) , the Court struck down a law revoking citizenship for remaining outside the United States in order to avoid conscription into the armed forces . Associate Justice William J. Brennan ( who had been in the majority in Perez ) wrote a separate opinion concurring with the majority in Mendoza @-@ Martinez and expressing reservations about Perez . In Schneider v. Rusk ( 1964 ) , where the Court invalidated a provision revoking the citizenship of naturalized citizens who returned to live permanently in their countries of origin , Brennan recused himself and did not participate in the decision of the case . 
 = = = Beys Afroyim = = = 
 Beys Afroyim ( born Ephraim Bernstein , 1893 ? – 1984 ) was an artist and active communist . Various sources state that he was born in either 1893 or 1898 , and either in Poland generally , specifically in the Polish town of <unk> , or in Riga , Latvia ( then part of the Russian Empire ) . In 1912 , Afroyim immigrated to the United States , and on June 14 , 1926 , he was naturalized as a U.S. citizen . He studied at the Art Institute of Chicago , as well as the National Academy of Design in New York City , and he was commissioned to paint portraits of George Bernard Shaw , Theodore Dreiser , and Arnold Schoenberg . In 1949 , Afroyim left the United States and settled in Israel , together with his wife and former student <unk> ( an Austrian artist ) . 
 In 1960 , following the breakdown of his marriage , Afroyim decided to return to the United States , but the State Department refused to renew his U.S. passport , ruling that because Afroyim had voted in the 1951 Israeli legislative election , he had lost his citizenship under the provisions of the Nationality Act of 1940 . A letter certifying Afroyim 's loss of citizenship was issued by the Immigration and Naturalization Service ( INS ) on January 13 , 1961 . 
 Afroyim challenged the revocation of his citizenship . Initially , he claimed that he had not in fact voted in Israel 's 1951 election , but had entered the polling place solely in order to draw sketches of voters casting their ballots . Afroyim 's initial challenge was rejected in administrative proceedings in 1965 . He then sued in federal district court , with his lawyer agreeing to a stipulation that Afroyim had in fact voted in Israel , but arguing that the statute under which this action had resulted in his losing his citizenship was unconstitutional . A federal judge of the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York rejected Afroyim 's claim on February 25 , 1966 , concluding that " in the opinion of Congress voting in a foreign political election could import ' allegiance to another country ' in some measure ' inconsistent with American citizenship ' " and that the question of this law 's validity had been settled by the Supreme Court 's 1958 Perez decision . 
 Afroyim appealed the district court 's ruling against him to the Second Circuit Court of Appeals , which upheld the lower court 's reasoning and decision on May 24 , 1966 . Two of the three judges who heard Afroyim 's appeal found the district court 's analysis and affirmation of Perez to be " exhaustive and most penetrating " . The third judge expressed serious reservations regarding the viability of Perez and suggested that Afroyim might have obtained a different result if he had framed his case differently , but decided to concur ( albeit reluctantly ) in the majority 's ruling . 
 = = = Arguments before the Supreme Court = = = 
 After losing his appeal to the Second Circuit , Afroyim asked the Supreme Court to overrule the precedent it had established in Perez , strike down the foreign voting provision of the Nationality Act as unconstitutional , and decide that he was still a United States citizen . Afroyim 's counsel argued that since " neither the Fourteenth Amendment nor any other provision of the Constitution expressly grants Congress the power to take away [ U.S. ] citizenship once it has been acquired ... the only way [ Afroyim ] could lose his citizenship was by his own voluntary renunciation of it . " The Supreme Court agreed to consider Afroyim 's case on October 24 , 1966 and held oral arguments on February 20 , 1967 . 
 The official respondent ( defendant ) in Afroyim 's case on behalf of the U.S. government was Dean Rusk , the Secretary of State during the Kennedy and Johnson administrations ( 1961 – 1969 ) . The legal brief laying out Afroyim 's arguments was written by Nanette <unk> , general counsel of the New York Civil Liberties Union ; the government 's brief was written by United States Solicitor General ( and future Supreme Court Associate Justice ) Thurgood Marshall . The oral arguments in the case were presented by attorneys Edward Ennis — chairman of the American Civil Liberties Union ( ACLU ) — for Afroyim , and Charles Gordon — general counsel for the INS — for the government . Afroyim was in New York City at this time , having been granted a visitor 's visa in 1965 while his case went through the courts . 
 Before heading the ACLU , Ennis had served as general counsel for the INS . In his oral argument supporting Afroyim , Ennis asserted that Congress lacked the power to prescribe forfeiture of citizenship , and he sharply criticized the foreign @-@ relations argument under which the Perez court had upheld loss of citizenship for voting in a foreign election — pointing out , for example , that when a referendum was held in 1935 on the status of the Saar ( a region of Germany occupied after World War I by the United Kingdom and France ) , Americans had participated in the voting without raising any concerns within the State Department at the time . 
 Gordon did not make a good showing in the Afroyim oral arguments despite his skill and experience in the field of immigration law , according to a 2005 article on the Afroyim case by law professor Peter J. Spiro . Gordon mentioned Israeli elections in 1955 and 1959 in which Afroyim had voted — facts which had not previously been presented to the Supreme Court in the attorneys ' briefs or the written record of the case — and much of the remaining questioning from the justices involved criticism of Gordon for confusing matters through the last @-@ minute introduction of this new material . 
 Afroyim 's earlier stipulation that he had voted in the 1951 Israeli election — together with an accompanying concession by the government that this was the sole ground upon which it had acted to revoke Afroyim 's citizenship — allowed the potential issue of diluted allegiance through dual citizenship to be sidestepped . Indeed , in 1951 there was no Israeli nationality law ; eligibility to vote in the election that year had been based on residence rather than any concept of citizenship . Although Afroyim had later acquired Israeli citizenship and voted in at least two other elections in his new country , his lawyers were able to avoid discussing this matter and instead focus entirely on whether foreign voting was a sufficient cause for loss of one 's U.S. citizenship . 
 = = Opinion of the Court = = 
 The Supreme Court ruled in Afroyim 's favor in a 5 – 4 decision issued on May 29 , 1967 . The opinion of the Court — written by Associate Justice Hugo Black , and joined by Chief Justice Warren and Associate Justices William O. Douglas and Abe Fortas — as well as Associate Justice Brennan , who had been part of the majority in Perez — was grounded in the reasoning Warren had used nine years earlier in his Perez dissent . The court 's majority now held that " Congress has no power under the Constitution to divest a person of his United States citizenship absent his voluntary renunciation thereof . " Specifically repudiating Perez , the majority of the justices rejected the claim that Congress had any power to revoke citizenship and said that " no such power can be sustained as an implied attribute of sovereignty " . Instead , quoting from the Citizenship Clause , Black wrote : 
 " All persons born or naturalized in the United States ... are citizens of the United States .... " There is no indication in these words of a fleeting citizenship , good at the moment it is acquired but subject to destruction by the Government at any time . Rather the Amendment can most reasonably be read as defining a citizenship which a citizen keeps unless he voluntarily relinquishes it . Once acquired , this Fourteenth Amendment citizenship was not to be shifted , canceled , or diluted at the will of the Federal Government , the States , or any other governmental unit . 
 The Court found support for its position in the history of the unratified Titles of Nobility Amendment . The fact that this 1810 proposal had been framed as a constitutional amendment , rather than an ordinary act of Congress , was seen by the majority as showing that , even before the passage of the Fourteenth Amendment , Congress did not believe that it had the power to revoke anyone 's citizenship . The Court further noted that a proposed 1818 act of Congress would have provided a way for citizens to voluntarily relinquish their citizenship , but opponents had argued that Congress had no authority to provide for expatriation . 
 Afroyim 's counsel had addressed only the foreign voting question and had carefully avoided any direct challenge to the idea that foreign naturalization might legitimately lead to loss of citizenship ( a concept which Warren had been willing to accept in his Perez dissent ) . Nevertheless , the Court 's Afroyim ruling went beyond even Warren 's earlier position — holding instead that " The very nature of our government makes it completely incongruous to have a rule of law under which a group of citizens temporarily in office can deprive another group of citizens of their citizenship . " 
 = = = Dissent = = = 
 The minority — in a dissent written by Associate Justice John Marshall Harlan II and joined by Associate Justices Tom C. Clark , Potter Stewart , and Byron White — argued that Perez had been correctly decided , that nothing in the Constitution deprived Congress of the power to revoke a person 's citizenship for good cause , and that Congress was within its rights to decide that allowing Americans to vote in foreign elections ran contrary to the foreign policy interests of the nation and ought to result in loss of citizenship . Harlan wrote : 
 First , the Court fails almost entirely to dispute the reasoning in Perez ; it is essentially content with the <unk> and quite unsubstantiated assertion that Congress is without " any general power , express or implied , " to expatriate a citizen " without his assent . " Next , the Court embarks upon a lengthy , albeit incomplete , survey of the historical background of the congressional power at stake here , and yet , at the end , concedes that the history is susceptible of " conflicting inferences . " ... Finally , the Court declares that its result is bottomed upon the " language and the purpose " of the Citizenship Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment ; in explanation , the Court offers only the terms of the clause itself , the contention that any other result would be " completely incongruous , " and the essentially arcane observation that the " citizenry is the country and the country is its citizenry . " I can find nothing in this extraordinary series of <unk> which permits , still less compels , the imposition of this constitutional constraint upon the authority of Congress . 
 Responding to the assertion that Congress did not have power to revoke a person 's citizenship without his or her assent , Harlan predicted that " Until the Court indicates with greater precision what it means by ' assent ' , today 's opinion will surely cause still greater confusion in this area of the law . " 
 = = Subsequent developments = = 
 The Afroyim decision stated that no one with United States citizenship could be involuntarily deprived of that citizenship . Nevertheless , the Court distinguished a 1971 case , Rogers v. Bellei , holding in this newer case that individuals who had acquired citizenship via jus sanguinis , through birth outside the United States to an American parent or parents , could still risk loss of citizenship in various ways , since their citizenship ( unlike Afroyim 's citizenship ) was the result of federal statutes rather than the Citizenship Clause . The statutory provision whereby Bellei lost his citizenship — a U.S. residency requirement which he had failed to satisfy in his youth — was repealed by Congress in 1978 ; the foreign voting provision , already without effect since Afroyim , was repealed at the same time . 
 Although Afroyim appeared to rule out any involuntary revocation of a person 's citizenship , the government continued for the most part to pursue loss @-@ of @-@ citizenship cases when an American had acted in a way believed to imply an intent to give up citizenship — especially when an American had become a naturalized citizen of another country . In a 1980 case , however — Vance v. Terrazas — the Supreme Court ruled that intent to relinquish citizenship needed to be proved by itself , and not simply inferred from an individual 's having voluntarily performed an action designated by Congress as being incompatible with an intent to keep one 's citizenship . 
 The concept of dual citizenship , which previously had been strongly opposed by the U.S. government , has become more accepted in the years since Afroyim . In 1980 , the administration of President Jimmy Carter concluded that the Bancroft Treaties — a series of bilateral agreements , formulated between 1868 and 1937 , which provided for automatic loss of citizenship upon foreign naturalization of a U.S. citizen — were no longer enforceable , due in part to Afroyim , and gave notice terminating these treaties . In 1990 , the State Department adopted new guidelines for evaluating potential loss @-@ of @-@ citizenship cases , under which the government now assumes in almost all situations that Americans do not in fact intend to give up their citizenship unless they explicitly indicate to U.S. officials that this is their intention . As explained by Peter J. Spiro , " In the long run , Afroyim 's vision of an absolute right to retain citizenship has been largely , if quietly , vindicated . As a matter of practice , it is now virtually impossible to lose American citizenship without formally and expressly renouncing it . " 
 While acknowledging that " American citizenship enjoys strong protection against loss under Afroyim and Terrazas " , retired journalist Henry S. Matteo suggested , " It would have been more equitable ... had the Supreme Court relied on the Eighth Amendment , which adds a moral tone as well as a firmer constitutional basis , than the Fourteenth . " Matteo also said , " Under Afroyim there is a lack of balance between rights and protections on one hand , and obligations and responsibilities on the other , all four elements of which have been an integral part of the concept of citizenship , as history shows . " Political scientist P. Allan <unk> wrote that " it is doubtful that any [ Supreme Court decision ] created a more complex problem for the United States than Afroyim v. Rusk " , a decision which he believed had " since become a source of embarrassment for the United States in its relationships with the Arab world " because of the way it facilitated dual U.S. – Israeli citizenship and participation by Americans in Israel 's armed forces . 
 After his Supreme Court victory , Afroyim divided his time between West Brighton ( Staten Island , New York ) and the Israeli city of Safed until his death on May 19 , 1984 , in West Brighton . 
 = Macaroni penguin = 
 The macaroni penguin ( Eudyptes <unk> ) is a species of penguin found from the Subantarctic to the Antarctic Peninsula . One of six species of crested penguin , it is very closely related to the royal penguin , and some authorities consider the two to be a single species . It bears a distinctive yellow crest , and the face and upperparts are black and sharply delineated from the white underparts . Adults weigh on average 5 @.@ 5 kg ( 12 lb ) and are 70 cm ( 28 in ) in length . The male and female are similar in appearance , although the male is slightly larger and stronger with a relatively larger bill . Like all penguins , it is flightless , with a streamlined body and wings stiffened and flattened into flippers for a marine lifestyle . They also have red eyes . 
 Its diet consists of a variety of crustaceans , mainly krill , as well as small fish and cephalopods ; the species consumes more marine life annually than any other species of seabird . These birds moult once a year , spending about three to four weeks ashore , before returning to the sea . Numbering up to 100 @,@ 000 individuals , the breeding colonies of the macaroni penguin are among the largest and densest of all penguin species . After spending the summer breeding , penguins disperse into the oceans for six months ; a 2009 study found that macaroni penguins from Kerguelen travelled over 10 @,@ 000 km ( 6 @,@ 200 mi ) in the central Indian Ocean . With about 18 million individuals , the macaroni penguin is the most numerous penguin species . However , widespread declines in populations have been recorded since the mid @-@ 1970s . Their conservation status is being reclassified as vulnerable . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The macaroni penguin was described from the Falkland Islands in 1837 by German naturalist Johann Friedrich von Brandt . It is one of six or so species in the genus Eudyptes , collectively known as crested penguins . The genus name is derived from the Ancient Greek words eu " good " , and <unk> " diver " . The specific epithet <unk> is derived from the Greek words <unk> " golden " , and lophos " crest " . 
 The common name was recorded from the early 19th century in the Falkland Islands . English sailors apparently named the species for its conspicuous yellow crest ; <unk> was a term for a particular style in 18th @-@ century England marked by flamboyant or excessive ornamentation . A person who adopted this fashion was labelled a " <unk> " or " macaroni " , as in the song " Yankee Doodle " . 
 Molecular clock evidence using DNA suggests the macaroni penguin split from its closest relative , the royal penguin ( Eudyptes <unk> ) , around 1 @.@ 5 million years ago . Although the two have generally been considered separate species , the close similarities of their DNA sequences has led some , such as the Australian ornithologists Les Christidis and Walter Boles , to treat the royal as a subspecies of the macaroni . The two species are very similar in appearance , although the royal penguin has a white face instead of the usually black face of the macaroni . Interbreeding with the Indo @-@ Pacific subspecies of the southern rockhopper penguin ( E. <unk> <unk> ) has been reported at Heard and Marion Islands , with three hybrids recorded there by a 1987 – 88 Australian National Antarctic Research Expedition .

 The macaroni penguin is a large , crested penguin , similar in appearance to other members of the genus Eudyptes . An adult bird has an average length of around 70 cm ( 28 in ) ; the weight varies markedly depending on time of year and sex . Males average from 3 @.@ 3 kg ( 7 lb ) after incubating , or 3 @.@ 7 kg ( 8 lb ) after moult to 6 @.@ 4 kg ( 14 lb ) before moult , while females average 3 @.@ 2 kg ( 7 lb ) after to 5 @.@ 7 kg ( 13 lb ) before moult . Among standard measurements , the thick bill ( from the gape ) measures 7 to 8 cm ( 2 @.@ 8 to 3 @.@ 1 in ) , the culmen being around a centimetre less . The wing , from the shoulder to the tip , is around 20 @.@ 4 cm ( 8 @.@ 0 in ) and the tail is 9 – 10 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 – 3 @.@ 9 in ) long . The head , chin , throat , and upper parts are black and sharply demarcated against the white under parts . The black plumage has a bluish sheen when new and brownish when old . The most striking feature is the yellow crest that arises from a patch on the centre of the forehead , and extends horizontally backwards to the nape . The flippers are blue @-@ black on the upper surface with a white trailing edge , and mainly white underneath with a black tip and leading edge . The large , bulbous bill is orange @-@ brown . The iris is red and a patch of pinkish bare skin is found from the base of the bill to the eye . The legs and feet are pink . The male and female are similar in appearance , although males tend to be slightly larger . Males also bear relatively larger bills , which average around 6 @.@ 1 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 in ) compared to 5 @.@ 4 cm ( 2 @.@ 1 in ) in females ; this feature has been used to tell the sexes apart . 
 Immature birds are distinguished by their smaller size , smaller , duller @-@ brown bill , dark grey chin and throat , and absent or underdeveloped head plumes , often just a scattering of yellow feathers . The crest is fully developed in birds aged three to four years , a year or two before breeding age . 
 Macaroni penguins moult once a year , a process in which they replace all of their old feathers . They spend around two weeks accumulating fat before moulting because they do not feed during the moult , as they cannot enter the water to forage for food without feathers . The process typically takes three to four weeks , which they spend sitting ashore . Once finished , they go back to sea and return to their colonies to mate in the spring . Overall survival rates are poorly known ; the successful return of breeding adults at South Georgia Island varied between 49 % and 78 % over three years , and around 10 % of those that did return did not breed the following year . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 A 1993 review estimated that the macaroni was the most abundant species of penguin , with a minimum of 11 @,@ 841 @,@ 600 pairs worldwide . Macaroni penguins range from the Subantarctic to the Antarctic Peninsula ; at least 216 breeding colonies at 50 sites have been recorded . In South America , macaroni penguins are found in southern Chile , the Falkland Islands , South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands , and South Orkney Islands . They also occupy much of Antarctica and the Antarctic Peninsula , including the northern South Shetland Islands , Bouvet Island , the Prince Edward and Marion islands , the Crozet Islands , the Kerguelen Islands , and the Heard and McDonald Islands . While foraging for food , groups will range north to the islands off Australia , New Zealand , southern Brazil , Tristan da Cunha , and South Africa . 
 = = = Conservation = = = 
 Although the population of macaroni penguins is estimated at around 18 million mature individuals , a substantial decline has been recorded in several locations . This includes a 50 % reduction in the South Georgia population between the mid @-@ 1970s to mid @-@ 1990s , and the disappearance of the species from Isla <unk> in Southern Chile . This decline of the overall population in the last 30 years has resulted in the classification of the species as globally Vulnerable by the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species . Long @-@ term monitoring programs are underway at a number of breeding colonies , and many of the islands that support breeding populations of this penguin are protected reserves . The Heard Islands and McDonald Islands are World Heritage Sites for the macaroni penguin . The macaroni penguin may be being impacted by commercial fishing and marine pollution . A 2008 study suggests the abilities of female penguins to reproduce may be negatively affected by <unk> and fishing @-@ induced reductions in krill density . 
 = = Life history = = 
 Like most other penguin species , the macaroni penguin is a social animal in its nesting and its foraging behaviour ; its breeding colonies are among the largest and most densely populated . Scientist Charles Andre <unk> found that macaroni penguins nesting at Kerguelen dispersed eastwards over an area exceeding 3 × 106 km2 . Fitted with geolocation sensors , the 12 penguins studied travelled over 10 @,@ 000 km ( 6 @,@ 200 mi ) during the six- to seven @-@ month study period and spent their time largely within a zone 47 – 49 ° S and 70 – 110 ° E in the central Indian Ocean , not coming ashore once . This area , known as the Polar Frontal Zone , was notable for the absence of krill . 
 Living in colonies results in a high level of social interaction between birds , which has led to a large repertoire of visual , as well as vocal , displays . These behaviours peak early in the breeding period , and colonies particularly quieten when the male macaroni penguins are at sea . Agonistic displays are those which are intended to confront or drive off or , alternatively , appease and avoid conflict with other individuals . Macaroni penguins , particularly those on adjacent nests , may engage in ' bill @-@ jousting ' ; birds lock bills and wrestle , each trying to unseat the other , as well as batter with flippers and peck or strike its opponent 's nape . Submissive displays include the ' slender walk ' , where birds move through the colony with feathers flattened , flippers moved to the front of the body , and head and neck hunched , and general hunching of head and neck when incubating or standing at the nest . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 The diet of the macaroni penguin consists of a variety of crustaceans , squid and fish , although the proportions that each makes up vary with locality and season . Krill , particularly Antarctic krill ( Euphausia superba ) , account for over 90 % of food during breeding season . Cephalopods and small fish such as the marbled <unk> ( <unk> rossii ) , painted <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , <unk> <unk> , the lanternfish species <unk> anderssoni , <unk> <unk> and P. <unk> become more important during chick @-@ rearing . Like several other penguin species , the macaroni penguin sometimes deliberately swallows small ( 10 – to 30 @-@ mm @-@ diameter ) stones ; this behaviour has been speculated to aid in providing ballast for deep @-@ sea diving , or to help grind food , especially the exoskeletons of crustaceans which are a significant part of its diet . 
 Foraging for food is generally conducted on a daily basis , from dawn to dusk when they have chicks to feed . Overnight trips are sometimes made , especially as the chicks grow older ; a 2008 study that used surgically implanted data loggers to track the movement of the birds showed the foraging trips become longer once the chick @-@ rearing period is over . Birds venture out for 10 – 20 days during incubation and before the moult . Macaroni penguins are known to be the largest single consumer of marine resources among all of the seabirds , with an estimated take of 9 @.@ 2 million tonnes of krill a year . Outside the breeding season , macaroni penguins tend to dive deeper , longer , and more efficiently during their winter migration than during the summer breeding season . Year round , foraging dives usually occur during daylight hours , but winter dives are more constrained by daylight due to the shorter days . 
 Foraging distance from colonies has been measured at around 50 km ( 31 mi ) at South Georgia , offshore over the continental shelf , and anywhere from 59 to 303 kilometres ( 37 to 188 mi ) at Marion Island . Macaroni penguins normally forage at depths of 15 to 70 m ( 49 to 230 ft ) , but have been recorded diving down to 100 m ( 330 ft ) on occasions . Some night foraging does occur , but these dives are much shallower , ranging from only 3 to 6 m ( 9 @.@ 8 to 19 @.@ 7 ft ) in depth . Dives rarely exceed two minutes in duration . All dives are V @-@ shaped , and no time is spent at the sea bottom ; about half the time on a foraging trip is spent diving . Birds have been calculated as catching from 4 to 16 krill or 40 to 50 amphipods per dive . 
 = = = Predators = = = 
 The macaroni penguin 's predators consist of birds and aquatic mammals . The leopard seal ( <unk> <unk> ) , Antarctic fur seal ( Arctocephalus gazella ) , Subantarctic fur seal ( A. tropicalis ) , and killer whale ( Orcinus orca ) sometimes hunt adult macaroni penguins in the water . Colonies suffer low rates of predation if undisturbed ; predators generally only take eggs and young that have been left unattended or deserted . Skua species , the snowy <unk> ( <unk> alba ) , and kelp gull ( Larus dominicanus ) prey on eggs , and skuas and giant petrels also sometimes take chicks . 
 = = = Courtship and breeding = = = 
 Female macaroni penguins can begin breeding at around five years of age , while the males do not normally breed until at least six years old . Females breed at a younger age because the male population is larger . The surplus of male penguins allows the female penguins to select more experienced male partners as soon as the females are physically able to breed . Commencing a few days after females arrive at the colony , sexual displays are used by males to attract partners and advertise their territory , and by pairs once together at the nest site and at changeover of incubation shifts . In the ' ecstatic display ' , a penguin bows forward , making loud throbbing sounds , and then extends its head and neck up until its neck and beak are vertical . The bird then waves its head from side to side , braying loudly . Birds also engage in mutual bowing , trumpeting , and preening . Monitoring of pair fidelity at South Georgia has shown around three @-@ quarters of pairs will breed together again the following year . 
 Adult macaroni penguins typically begin to breed late in October , and lay their eggs in early November . The nest itself is a shallow scrape in the ground which may be lined with some pebbles , stones , or grass , or nestled in a clump of tussock grass ( on South Georgia Island ) . Nests are densely packed , ranging from around 66 cm apart in the middle of a colony to 86 cm at the edges . A fertile macaroni penguin will lay two eggs each breeding season . The first egg to be laid weighs 90 – 94 g ( 3 @.@ 2 – 3 @.@ 3 oz ) , 61 – 64 % the size of the 145 – 155 g ( 5 @.@ 1 – 5 @.@ 5 oz ) second , and is extremely unlikely to survive . The two eggs together weigh 4 @.@ 8 % of the mother 's body weight ; the composition of an egg is 20 % yolk , 66 % albumen , and 14 % shell . Like those of other penguin species , the shell is relatively thick to minimise risk of breakage , and the yolk is large , which is associated with chicks born in an advanced stage of development . Some of the yolk remains at hatching and is consumed by the chick in its first few days . 
 The fate of the first egg is mostly unknown , but studies on the related royal penguin and erect @-@ crested penguin show the female tips the egg out when the larger second egg is laid . The task of incubating the egg is divided into three roughly equal sessions of around 12 days each over a five @-@ week period . The first session is shared by both parents , followed by the male returning to sea , leaving the female alone to tend the egg . Upon the male 's return , the female goes off to sea and does not return until the chick has hatched . Both sexes fast for a considerable period during breeding ; the male fasts for 37 days after arrival until he returns to sea for around 10 days before fasting while incubating eggs and young for another 36 days , and the female fasts for 42 days from her arrival after the male until late in the incubation period . Both adults lose 36 – 40 % of their body weight during this period . The second egg hatches around 34 days after it is laid . Macaroni penguins typically leave their breeding colony by April or May to disperse into the ocean . 
 From the moment the egg is hatched , the male macaroni penguin cares for the newly hatched chick . For about 23 to 25 days , the male protects its offspring and helps to keep it warm , since only a few of its feathers have grown in by this time . The female brings food to the chick every one to two days . When they are not being protected by the adult male penguins , the chicks form crèches to keep warm and stay protected . Once their adult feathers have grown in at about 60 to 70 days , they are ready to go out to sea on their own . 
 = Corona Borealis = 
 Corona Borealis is a small constellation in the Northern Celestial Hemisphere . It is one of the 48 constellations listed by the 2nd @-@ century astronomer Ptolemy , and remains one of the 88 modern constellations . Its brightest stars form a semicircular arc . Its Latin name , inspired by its shape , means " northern crown " . In classical mythology Corona Borealis generally represented the crown given by the god Dionysus to the Cretan princess Ariadne and set by him in the heavens . Other cultures likened the pattern to a circle of elders , an eagle 's nest , a bear 's den , or even a <unk> . Ptolemy also listed a southern counterpart , Corona Australis , with a similar pattern . 
 The brightest star is the magnitude 2 @.@ 2 Alpha Coronae Borealis . The yellow supergiant R Coronae Borealis is the prototype of a rare class of giant stars — the R Coronae Borealis variables — that are extremely hydrogen deficient , and thought to result from the merger of two white dwarfs . T Coronae Borealis , also known as the Blaze Star , is another unusual type of variable star known as a recurrent nova . Normally of magnitude 10 , it last flared up to magnitude 2 in 1946 . ADS 9731 and Sigma Coronae Borealis are multiple star systems with six and five components respectively . Five star systems have been found to have Jupiter @-@ sized exoplanets . Abell 2065 is a highly concentrated galaxy cluster one billion light @-@ years from the Solar System containing more than 400 members , and is itself part of the larger Corona Borealis Supercluster .

 Covering 179 square degrees and hence 0 @.@ 433 % of the sky , Corona Borealis ranks 73rd of the 88 modern constellations by area . Its position in the Northern Celestial Hemisphere means that the whole constellation is visible to observers north of 50 ° S. It is bordered by Boötes to the north and west , Serpens Caput to the south , and Hercules to the east . The three @-@ letter abbreviation for the constellation , as adopted by the International Astronomical Union in 1922 , is ' <unk> ' . The official constellation boundaries , as set by Eugène Delporte in 1930 , are defined by a polygon of eight segments ( illustrated in infobox ) . In the equatorial coordinate system , the right ascension coordinates of these borders lie between 15h <unk> and 16h <unk> , while the declination coordinates are between 39 @.@ 71 ° and 25 @.@ 54 ° . It has a counterpart — Corona Australis — in the Southern Celestial Hemisphere .

 The seven stars that make up the constellation 's distinctive crown @-@ shaped pattern are all 4th @-@ magnitude stars except for the brightest of them , Alpha Coronae Borealis . The other six stars are Theta , Beta , Gamma , Delta , Epsilon and Iota Coronae Borealis . The German cartographer Johann Bayer gave twenty stars in Corona Borealis Bayer designations from Alpha to Upsilon in his 1603 star atlas Uranometria . Zeta Coronae Borealis was noted to be a double star by later astronomers and its components designated Zeta1 and Zeta2 . John Flamsteed did likewise with Nu Coronae Borealis ; classed by Bayer as a single star , it was noted to be two close stars by Flamsteed . He named them 20 and 21 Coronae Borealis in his catalogue , alongside the designations Nu1 and Nu2 respectively . Chinese astronomers deemed nine stars to make up the asterism , adding Pi and Rho Coronae Borealis . Within the constellation 's borders , there are 37 stars brighter than or equal to apparent magnitude 6 @.@ 5 . 
 Also called <unk> or Gemma , Alpha Coronae Borealis appears as a blue @-@ white star of magnitude 2 @.@ 2 . In fact , it is an Algol @-@ type eclipsing binary that varies by 0 @.@ 1 magnitude with a period of 17 @.@ 4 days . The primary is a white main @-@ sequence star of spectral type A0V that is 2 @.@ 91 times the mass of the Sun ( M ☉ ) and 57 times as luminous ( L ☉ ) , and is surrounded by a debris disk out to a radius of around 60 astronomical units ( AU ) . The secondary companion is a yellow main @-@ sequence star of spectral type G5V that is a little smaller ( 0 @.@ 9 times ) the diameter of the Sun . Lying 75 ± 0 @.@ 5 light @-@ years from Earth , <unk> is believed to be a member of the Ursa Major Moving Group of stars that have a common motion through space . 
 Located 112 ± 3 light @-@ years away , Beta Coronae Borealis or Nusakan is a spectroscopic binary system whose two components are separated by 10 AU and orbit each other every 10 @.@ 5 years .

The brighter component , Theta Coronae Borealis A , is a blue @-@ white star that spins extremely rapidly — at a rate of around 393 km per second . A Be star , it is surrounded by a debris disk . 
 Flanking Alpha to the east is Gamma Coronae Borealis , yet another binary star system , whose components orbit each other every 92 @.@ 94 years and are roughly as far apart from each other as the Sun and Neptune . The brighter component has been classed as a Delta Scuti variable star , though this view is not universal . The components are main sequence stars of spectral types B9V and A3V . Located 170 ± 2 light @-@ years away , 4 @.@ 06 @-@ magnitude Delta Coronae Borealis is a yellow giant star of spectral type <unk> that is around 2 @.@ 4 M ☉ and has swollen to 7 @.@ 4 R ☉ .

For most of its existence , Delta Coronae Borealis was a blue @-@ white main @-@ sequence star of spectral type B before it ran out of hydrogen fuel in its core . Its luminosity and spectrum suggest it has just crossed the Hertzsprung gap , having finished burning core hydrogen and just begun burning hydrogen in a shell that surrounds the core . 
 Zeta Coronae Borealis is a double star with two blue @-@ white components 6 @.@ 3 arcseconds apart that can be readily separated at <unk> magnification . The primary is of magnitude 5 @.@ 1 and the secondary is of magnitude 6 @.@ 0 . Nu Coronae Borealis is an optical double , whose components are a similar distance from Earth but have different radial velocities , hence are assumed to be unrelated . The primary , Nu1 Coronae Borealis , is a red giant of spectral type M2III and magnitude 5 @.@ 2 , lying 640 ± 30 light @-@ years distant , and the secondary , Nu2 Coronae Borealis , is an orange @-@ hued giant star of spectral type K5III and magnitude 5 @.@ 4 , estimated to be 590 ± 30 light @-@ years away . Sigma Coronae Borealis , on the other hand , is a true multiple star system divisible by small amateur telescopes . It is actually a complex system composed of two stars around as massive as the Sun that orbit each other every 1 @.@ 14 days , orbited by a third Sun @-@ like star every 726 years . The fourth and fifth components are a binary red dwarf system that is 14 @,@ 000 AU distant from the other three stars . ADS 9731 is an even rarer multiple system in the constellation , composed of six stars , two of which are spectroscopic binaries . 
 Corona Borealis is home to two remarkable variable stars . T Coronae Borealis is a cataclysmic variable star also known as the Blaze Star . Normally placid around magnitude 10 — it has a minimum of 10 @.@ 2 and maximum of 9 @.@ 9 — it brightens to magnitude 2 in a period of hours , caused by a nuclear chain reaction and the subsequent explosion . T Coronae Borealis is one of a handful of stars called recurrent novae , which include T Pyxidis and U Scorpii . An outburst of T Coronae Borealis was first recorded in 1866 ; its second recorded outburst was in February 1946 . T Coronae Borealis is a binary star with a red @-@ hued giant primary and a white dwarf secondary , the two stars orbiting each other over a period of approximately 8 months . R Coronae Borealis is a yellow @-@ hued variable supergiant star , over 7000 light @-@ years from Earth , and prototype of a class of stars known as R Coronae Borealis variables . Normally of magnitude 6 , its brightness periodically drops as low as magnitude 15 and then slowly increases over the next several months . These declines in magnitude come about as dust that has been ejected from the star obscures it . Direct imaging with the Hubble Space Telescope shows extensive dust clouds out to a radius of around 2000 AU from the star , corresponding with a stream of fine dust ( composed of grains 5 nm in diameter ) associated with the star 's stellar wind and coarser dust ( composed of grains with a diameter of around 0 @.@ 14 µm ) ejected periodically . 
 There are several other variables of reasonable brightness for amateur astronomer to observe , including three Mira @-@ type long period variables : S Coronae Borealis ranges between magnitudes 5 @.@ 8 and 14 @.@ 1 over a period of 360 days . Located around 1946 light @-@ years distant , it shines with a luminosity 16 @,@ 643 times that of the Sun and has a surface temperature of 3033 K. One of the reddest stars in the sky , V Coronae Borealis is a cool star with a surface temperature of <unk> K that shines with a luminosity 102 @,@ 831 times that of the Sun and is a remote <unk> light @-@ years distant from Earth . Varying between magnitudes 6 @.@ 9 and 12 @.@ 6 over a period of 357 days , it is located near the junction of the border of Corona Borealis with Hercules and <unk> . Located 1 @.@ 5 ° northeast of Tau Coronae Borealis , W Coronae Borealis ranges between magnitudes 7 @.@ 8 and 14 @.@ 3 over a period of 238 days . Another red giant , RR Coronae Borealis is a M3 @-@ type semiregular variable star that varies between magnitudes 7 @.@ 3 and 8 @.@ 2 over 60 @.@ 8 days . RS Coronae Borealis is yet another semiregular variable red giant , which ranges between magnitudes 8 @.@ 7 to 11 @.@ 6 over 332 days . It is unusual in that it is a red star with a high proper motion ( greater than 50 milliarcseconds a year ) . Meanwhile , U Coronae Borealis is an Algol @-@ type eclipsing binary star system whose magnitude varies between 7 @.@ 66 and 8 @.@ 79 over a period of 3 @.@ 45 days 
 TY Coronae Borealis is a pulsating white dwarf ( of ZZ Ceti ) type , which is around 70 % as massive as the Sun , yet has only 1 @.@ 1 % of its diameter . Discovered in 1990 , UW Coronae Borealis is a low @-@ mass X @-@ ray binary system composed of a star less massive than the Sun and a neutron star surrounded by an accretion disk that draws material from the companion star . It varies in brightness in an unusually complex manner : the two stars orbit each other every 111 minutes , yet there is another cycle of 112 @.@ 6 minutes , which corresponds to the orbit of the disk around the degenerate star . The beat period of 5 @.@ 5 days indicates the time the accretion disk — which is asymmetrical — takes to precess around the star . 
 = = = Extrasolar planetary systems = = = 
 Extrasolar planets have been confirmed in five star systems , four of which were found by the radial velocity method . The spectrum of Epsilon Coronae Borealis was analysed for seven years from 2005 to 2012 , revealing a planet around 6 @.@ 7 times as massive as Jupiter ( MJ ) orbiting every 418 days at an average distance of around 1 @.@ 3 AU . Epsilon itself is a 1 @.@ 7 M ☉ orange giant of spectral type K2III that has swollen to 21 R ☉ and 151 L ☉ . Kappa Coronae Borealis is a spectral type <unk> orange subgiant nearly twice as massive as the Sun ; around it lie a dust debris disk , and one planet with a period of 3 @.@ 4 years . This planet 's mass is estimated at 2 @.@ 5 MJ . The dimensions of the debris disk indicate it is likely there is a second substellar companion . Omicron Coronae Borealis is a K @-@ type clump giant with one confirmed planet with a mass of 0 @.@ 83 MJ that orbits every 187 days — one of the two least massive planets known around clump giants . HD <unk> is an orange giant of spectral type K0III found to have one planet of 2 @.@ 9 MJ . Discovered by the Doppler method in 2010 , it takes 176 days to complete an orbit . XO @-@ 1 is a magnitude 11 yellow main @-@ sequence star located approximately 560 light @-@ years away , of spectral type G1V with a mass and radius similar to the Sun . In 2006 the hot Jupiter exoplanet XO @-@ 1b was discovered orbiting XO @-@ 1 by the transit method using the XO Telescope . Roughly the size of Jupiter , it completes an orbit around its star every three days . 
 The discovery of a Jupiter @-@ sized planetary companion was announced in 1997 via analysis of the radial velocity of Rho Coronae Borealis , a yellow main sequence star and Solar twin of spectral type G0V , around 57 light @-@ years distant from Earth . More accurate measurement of data from the Hipparcos satellite subsequently showed it instead to be a low @-@ mass star somewhere between 100 and 200 times the mass of Jupiter . Possible stable planetary orbits in the habitable zone were calculated for the binary star Eta Coronae Borealis , which is composed of two stars — yellow main sequence stars of spectral type G1V and <unk> respectively — similar in mass and spectrum to the Sun . No planet has been found , but a brown dwarf companion about 63 times as massive as Jupiter with a spectral type of L8 was discovered at a distance of <unk> AU from the pair in 2001 .

 = = Mythology = = 
 In Greek mythology , Corona Borealis was linked to the legend of Theseus and the minotaur . It was generally considered to represent a crown given by Dionysus to Ariadne , the daughter of Minos of Crete , after she had been abandoned by the Athenian prince Theseus . When she wore the crown at her marriage to Dionysus , he placed it in the heavens to commemorate their wedding . An alternate version has the besotted Dionysus give the crown to Ariadne , who in turn gives it to Theseus after he arrives in Crete to kill the minotaur that the Cretans have demanded tribute from Athens to feed . The hero uses the crown 's light to escape the labyrinth after disposing of the creature , and Dionysus later sets it in the heavens . The Latin author Hyginus linked it to a crown or wreath worn by Bacchus ( Dionysus ) to disguise his appearance when first approaching Mount Olympus and revealing himself to the gods , having been previously hidden as yet another child of Jupiter 's trysts with a mortal , in this case Semele . In Welsh mythology , it was called Caer <unk> , " the Castle of the Silver Circle " , and was the heavenly abode of the Lady <unk> . Corona Borealis was one of the 48 constellations mentioned in the Almagest of classical astronomer Ptolemy . 
 The Arabs called the constellation <unk> ( a name later given to Alpha Coronae Borealis ) , which means " separated " or " broken up " ( <unk> al @-@ <unk> ) , a reference to the resemblance of the stars of Corona Borealis to a loose string of jewels . This was also interpreted as a broken dish . Among the Bedouins , the constellation was known as <unk> al @-@ <unk> ( <unk> <unk> ) , or " the dish / bowl of the poor people " . 
 The Skidi people of Native Americans saw the stars of Corona Borealis representing a council of stars whose chief was Polaris . The constellation also symbolised the <unk> over a fireplace , which conveyed their messages to the gods , as well as how chiefs should come together to consider matters of importance . The Shawnee people saw the stars as the Heavenly Sisters , who descended from the sky every night to dance on earth . <unk> signifies the youngest and most comely sister , who was seized by a hunter who transformed into a field mouse to get close to her . They married though she later returned to the sky , with her heartbroken husband and son following later . The Mi 'kmaq of eastern Canada saw Corona Borealis as <unk> , the den of the celestial bear ( Alpha , Beta , Gamma and Delta Ursae Majoris ) . 
 Polynesian peoples often recognized Corona Borealis ; the people of the Tuamotus named it Na Kaua @-@ ki @-@ <unk> and probably Te <unk> . The constellation was likely called Kaua @-@ mea in Hawaii , <unk> in New Zealand , and Te Wale @-@ o @-@ <unk> in the Cook Islands atoll of Pukapuka . Its name in Tonga was uncertain ; it was either called Ao @-@ o @-@ <unk> or Kau @-@ <unk> . 
 In Australian Aboriginal astronomy , the constellation is called <unk> ( " the boomerang " ) due to the shape of the stars . The <unk> people of northwestern New South Wales saw Corona Borealis as mullion <unk> " eagle 's nest " , with Altair and Vega — each called mullion — the pair of eagles accompanying it . The Wardaman people of northern Australia held the constellation to be a gathering point for Men 's Law , Women 's Law and Law of both sexes come together and consider matters of existence .

 Corona Borealis was renamed Corona <unk> in honour of the Archbishop of Salzburg in the 1730 Atlas <unk> <unk> Firmamentum <unk> <unk> by <unk> Thomas , but this was not taken up by subsequent cartographers . The constellation was featured as a main plot ingredient in the short story " Hypnos " by H. P. Lovecraft , published in 1923 ; it is the object of fear of one of the protagonists in the novella . Finnish band Cadacross released an album titled Corona Borealis in 2002 . 
 = SMS Oldenburg ( 1884 ) = 
 SMS Oldenburg was an armored warship of the German Imperial Navy . Laid down at the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin in 1883 , the ship was launched in December 1884 and commissioned into the Navy in April 1886 . Oldenburg was intended to have been a fifth member of the Sachsen class of sortie corvettes , but budgetary limitations and dissatisfaction with the Sachsen class prompted a redesign that bore little resemblance to the earlier vessels . Oldenburg mounted her main battery of eight 24 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) guns amidships , six in a central casemate on the main deck and two directly above them on the broadside . She was the first German capital ship constructed entirely from German @-@ made steel . 
 Oldenburg did not see significant service with the German Navy . She participated in fleet training maneuvers in the late @-@ 1880s and early 1890s , but she spent the majority of the 1890s in reserve . Her only major deployment came in 1897 – 1898 when she joined an international naval demonstration to protest the Greek annexation of Crete . In 1900 , she was withdrawn from active duty and used as a harbor defense ship . From 1912 to 1919 , she was used by the High Seas Fleet as a target ship ; she was sold for scrapping in 1919 and broken up that year . 
 = = Design = = 
 Oldenburg was intended to be a fifth member of the Sachsen class of sortie corvettes . The design for the ship was radically altered , between 1879 and 1881 , for a variety of reasons . The German Navy was largely dissatisfied with the Sachsen class ships , and a number of design faults required correction . Budgetary constraints also limited the design of the ship , forcing the design staff to work within a displacement some 2 @,@ 000 t ( 2 @,@ 000 long tons ; 2 @,@ 200 short tons ) lower than that of the Sachsens . 
 Assessment of the design is mixed ; naval historian Erich Gröner states that Oldenburg was an " experimental design , of no real value in combat . " Conway 's All the World 's Fighting Ships concurs , stating that Oldenburg was " considered to be of little fighting value by the time she was completed . " The 1889 edition of the Brassey 's Naval Annual reported a contradictory opinion , however , stating that " The majority of German naval critics are dissatisfied to a greater or less extent with all of these vessels , the König Wilhelm , Kaiser , Deutschland , and Oldenburg excepted . "

 Oldenburg was 78 @.@ 40 m ( 257 @.@ 2 ft ) long at the waterline and 79 @.@ 80 m ( 261 @.@ 8 ft ) long overall . She had a beam of 18 m ( 59 ft ) and a draft of 6 @.@ 28 m ( 20 @.@ 6 ft ) forward and 6 @.@ 30 m ( 20 @.@ 7 ft ) aft . At the designed displacement , the vessel displaced 5 @,@ 249 metric tons ( 5 @,@ 166 long tons ; 5 @,@ 786 short tons ) . When the ship was fully loaded , she displaced 5 @,@ 743 t ( 5 @,@ 652 long tons ; 6 @,@ 331 short tons ) . Her hull was built with transverse and longitudinal steel frames ; iron was used for the stem and stern . The ship had twelve watertight compartments and a double bottom that ran for 60 percent of the length of the hull . Oldenburg was the first German capital ship built entirely from German @-@ made steel . 
 The German navy regarded Oldenburg as an adequate sea boat , though she suffered from significant pitching . As a result of her tendency to pitch severely , a 60 t ( 59 long tons ; 66 short tons ) ballast was permanently installed in the bow . She also lost a great deal of speed in heavy seas ; at conditions above Beaufort sea state 6 , this could be up to a 25 percent loss of speed . The ship could not operate under severe weather conditions . Her transverse metacentric height was .63 m ( 2 ft 1 in ) . Her standard complement consisted of 34 officers and 355 enlisted men , though her crew was later reorganized to 32 officers and 40 enlisted sailors . She carried a number of smaller boats , including one picket boat , one launch , two pinnaces , two cutters , two yawls , and one dinghy . 
 = = = Machinery = = = 
 Oldenburg was powered by two horizontal 4 @-@ cylinder double expansion steam engines in separate engine <unk> ; the two engines each drove a three @-@ bladed screw 4 @.@ 50 m ( 14 @.@ 8 ft ) in diameter . Steam was provided to the engines by eight transverse cylinder boilers , divided into two boiler rooms . Each boiler was equipped with three fireboxes , for a total of 24 , which operated at up to 5 standard atmospheres ( 510 kPa ) forced . The engines were designed to operate at 3 @,@ 900 indicated horsepower ( 2 @,@ 900 kW ) for a top speed of 14 knots ( 26 km / h ; 16 mph ) . On speed trials , her engines slightly exceeded the designed horsepower , at 3 @,@ 942 ihp ( 2 @,@ 940 kW ) , though Oldenburg made only 13 @.@ 8 knots ( 25 @.@ 6 km / h ; 15 @.@ 9 mph ) . 
 The ship was designed to store 348 t ( 343 long tons ; 384 short tons ) of coal , though she could accommodate up to 450 t ( 440 long tons ; 500 short tons ) . An additional 120 t ( 120 long tons ; 130 short tons ) of coal could be stored on her deck . At a cruising speed of 9 knots ( 17 km / h ; 10 mph ) , Oldenburg could steam for 1 @,@ 770 nautical miles ( 3 @,@ 280 km ; 2 @,@ 040 mi ) . Increasing her speed by one knot reduced her range to 1 @,@ 370 nmi ( 2 @,@ 540 km ; 1 @,@ 580 mi ) , and at 12 knots ( 22 km / h ; 14 mph ) , she could cruise for only 980 nmi ( 1 @,@ 810 km ; 1 @,@ 130 mi ) . Steering was controlled by a single rudder . She was equipped with three electrical generators with a total output of 29 kilowatts at 65 volts . 
 = = = Armament and armor = = = 
 Oldenburg carried eight 24 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) L / 30 hooped guns in an unusual configuration : six guns on the main deck , one on each broadside , four in embrasures at each corner of the central battery to give a measure of end @-@ on fire , and two on the upper deck firing broadside . These guns were supplied with 494 rounds of ammunition , and could depress to − 5 ° and elevate to 8 ° . This enabled a maximum range of 5 @,@ 700 to 8 @,@ 800 m ( 6 @,@ 200 to 9 @,@ 600 yd ) . She was also equipped with four 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) L / 22 guns and two 8 @.@ 7 cm ( 3 @.@ 4 in ) L / 24 guns . Four 35 cm ( 14 in ) torpedo tubes rounded out her armament . One was mounted in the bow , submerged , two were placed on the broadside above water , and the fourth was located in the stern , also above water . She carried ten torpedoes . 
 Oldenburg 's armor consisted of compound steel backed with teak ; the steel was fabricated by the Dillinger Works . The main armored belt was composed of two strakes ; the steel upper strake was 300 mm ( 12 in ) thick amidships , where it protected the ship 's vitals . The belt was reduced on either end of the central portion to 200 mm ( 7 @.@ 9 in ) . The lower strake was 250 mm ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) thick in the central section and 180 mm ( 7 @.@ 1 in ) on either end . The entire belt was backed with 250 mm of teak amidships and 300 mm of teak on either end . The sides of the armored casemates for the main battery were 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) thick . The ship 's deck was 30 mm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) thick . Her forward conning tower had 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick sides and a 25 mm ( 0 @.@ 98 in ) thick roof . The rear conning tower was given only splinter protection , with 15 mm ( 0 @.@ 59 in ) thick sides and a 12 mm ( 0 @.@ 47 in ) thick roof .

 Oldenburg was laid down in 1883 at the AG Vulcan shipyard in Stettin , under construction number 132 . She was launched on 20 December 1884 , after which fitting @-@ out work commenced . She was completed by April 1886 and commissioned into the German Navy on 8 April . She immediately joined the I Division of the fleet , alongside Sachsen , Bayern , and Württemberg , for the annual fleet maneuvers . Bayern and Württemberg suffered from engine troubles throughout the exercises , but Oldenburg performed satisfactorily . 
 In June 1887 , Germany dedicated the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal ; Oldenburg was among the ships present during the celebrations . Oldenburg was assigned to the training squadron for the maneuvers in August – September 1887 , along with König Wilhelm and Kaiser . The majority of the exercises were focused in the Baltic , but the fleet did conduct maneuvers in the North Sea for eight days in September . Oldenburg also participated in the visit to Great Britain in August 1889 , where Wilhelm II took part in the Cowes Regatta . The ship was assigned to the I Division with Sachsen , Baden , and the new cruiser Irene . Oldenburg and the rest of the fleet joined the Royal Navy in a fleet review for Queen Victoria . 
 Oldenburg participated in the ceremonial transfer of the island of Helgoland from British to German control in the summer of 1890 . She was present during the fleet maneuvers in September , where the entire eight @-@ ship armored squadron simulated a Russian fleet blockading Kiel . She remained with the I Division in 1891 ; the year 's maneuvers simulated a two @-@ front war against Russia and either France or Denmark . In 1892 , however , Württemberg replaced Oldenburg in the I Division , and the latter went into reserve . The ship remained out of service for the next five years . She returned to active duty in 1897 to join an international naval demonstration off the island of Crete , which had been annexed by Greece . The ship remained in the demonstration until March 1898 , when Germany and Austria @-@ Hungary withdrew their naval contingents in a show of dissatisfaction over the compromise solution , which left Crete under Ottoman control , but with a Greek prince . 
 In 1900 , Oldenburg was reduced to serve as a harbor guard ship . She was later used as a depot ship before being stricken from the naval register on 13 January 1912 . The vessel was then used as a target ship by the High Seas Fleet until after the German defeat in World War I. Oldenburg was sold to <unk> Company , a ship @-@ breaking firm , on 5 May 1919 . The ship was dismantled for scrap in Wilhelmshaven that year . 
 = Stephen Colbert = 
 Stephen Tyrone Colbert ( / koʊlˈbɛər / , né : / ˈkoʊlbərt / ; born May 13 , 1964 ) is an American comedian , writer , producer , actor , media critic , and television host . He currently hosts the late @-@ night television talk show The Late Show with Stephen Colbert on CBS . 
 Colbert had originally studied to be an actor , but became interested in improvisational theatre when he met Second City director Del Close while attending Northwestern University . He first performed professionally as an understudy for Steve Carell at Second City Chicago ; among his troupe mates were comedians Paul Dinello and Amy Sedaris , with whom he developed the sketch comedy series Exit 57 . Colbert also wrote and performed on the short @-@ lived Dana Carvey Show before collaborating with Sedaris and Dinello again on the cult television series Strangers with Candy . He gained considerable attention for his role on the latter as closeted gay history teacher Chuck Noblet . His work as a correspondent on Comedy Central 's news @-@ parody series The Daily Show first introduced him to a wide audience . 
 In 2005 , he left The Daily Show to host a spin @-@ off series , The Colbert Report . Following The Daily Show 's news @-@ parody concept , The Colbert Report was a parody of personality @-@ driven political opinion shows such as The O 'Reilly Factor , in which Colbert portrayed a caricatured version of conservative political pundits . The series established itself as one of Comedy Central 's highest @-@ rated series , earning Colbert an invitation to perform as featured entertainer at the White House Correspondents ' Association Dinner in 2006 . Colbert has won nine Primetime Emmy Awards , two Grammy Awards , and two Peabody Awards . Colbert succeeded David Letterman as the host of The Late Show on CBS , beginning his tenure on September 8 , 2015 . 
 Colbert was named one of Time 's 100 most influential people in 2006 and 2012 . His book , I Am America ( And So Can You ! ) , was number one on The New York Times Best Seller list . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Colbert was born in Washington , D.C. , the youngest of 11 children in a Catholic family . He grew up on James Island in Charleston , South Carolina . Colbert and his siblings , in order from oldest to youngest , are James , Edward , Mary , William , Margo , Thomas , Jay , Elizabeth , Paul , Peter , and Stephen . His father , James William Colbert , Jr . , was a doctor and medical school dean at Yale University , Saint Louis University , and finally at the Medical University of South Carolina where he served as vice president for academic affairs . Stephen 's mother , Lorna Elizabeth Colbert ( née Tuck ) , was a homemaker . 
 In interviews , Colbert has described his parents as devout people who also strongly valued intellectualism and taught their children that it was possible to question the church and still be Catholic . The emphasis his family placed on intelligence and his observation of negative stereotypes of Southerners led Colbert to train himself to suppress his Southern accent while he was still quite young . As a child , he observed that Southerners were often depicted as being less intelligent than other characters on scripted television ; to avoid that stereotype , he taught himself to imitate the speech of American news anchors . 
 While Colbert sometimes comedically claims his surname is French , he is of 15 / <unk> Irish ancestry ( one of his paternal great @-@ great @-@ grandmothers was of German and English descent ) . Many of his ancestors emigrated from Ireland to North America in the 19th century before and during the Great Famine . Originally , his surname was pronounced / ˈkoʊlbərt / ( <unk> @-@ <unk> ) in English ; Stephen Colbert 's father , James , wanted to pronounce the name / koʊlˈbɛər / ( kohl @-@ <unk> ) , but maintained the / ˈkoʊlbərt / pronunciation out of respect for his own father . He offered his children the option to pronounce the name whichever way they preferred . Stephen started using / koʊlˈbɛər / later in life when he transferred to Northwestern University , taking advantage of the opportunity to reinvent himself in a new place where no one knew him . Stephen 's brother , Ed , an intellectual property attorney , retained / ˈkoʊlbərt / ; this was shown in a February 12 , 2009 , appearance on The Colbert Report , when his youngest brother asked him , " / ˈkoʊlbərt / or / koʊlˈbɛər / ? " Ed responded " / ˈkoʊlbərt / " , to which Stephen jokingly replied , " See you in Hell " . 
 On September 11 , 1974 , when Colbert was ten years old , his father and two of his brothers , Peter and Paul , were killed in the crash of Eastern Air Lines Flight 212 while it was attempting to land in Charlotte , North Carolina . They were en route to enroll the two boys at Canterbury School in New Milford , Connecticut . Lorna Colbert relocated the family downtown to the more urban environment of East Bay Street in Charleston . Colbert found the transition difficult and did not easily make new friends in his new neighborhood . Colbert later described himself during this time as detached , lacking a sense of importance regarding the things with which other children concerned themselves . He developed a love of science fiction and fantasy novels , especially the works of J. R. R. Tolkien , of which he remains an avid fan . During his adolescence , he also developed an intense interest in fantasy role @-@ playing games , especially Dungeons & Dragons , a pastime which he later characterized as an early experience in acting and improvisation . 
 Colbert attended Charleston 's Episcopal Porter @-@ Gaud School , where he participated in several school plays and contributed to the school newspaper but was not highly motivated academically . During his adolescence , he briefly fronted a Rolling Stones cover band called A Shot in the Dark . When he was younger , he had hoped to study marine biology , but surgery intended to repair a severely perforated eardrum caused him inner ear damage . The damage was severe enough that he was unable to pursue a career that would involve scuba diving . The damage also left him deaf in his right ear . For a while , he was uncertain whether he would attend college , but ultimately he applied and was accepted to Hampden – Sydney College in Virginia , where a friend had also enrolled . There he continued to participate in plays while studying mainly philosophy . He found the curriculum rigorous , but was more focused than he had been in high school and was able to apply himself to his studies . Despite the lack of a significant theater community at Hampden – Sydney , Colbert 's interest in acting escalated during this time . After two years , he transferred to Northwestern University as a theater major to study performance , emboldened by the realization that he loved performing , even when no one was coming to shows . He graduated from Northwestern 's School of Communication in 1986 . 
 = = Early career in comedy = = 
 While at Northwestern , Colbert studied with the intent of becoming a dramatic actor ; mostly he performed in experimental plays and was uninterested in comedy . He began performing improvisation while in college , both in the campus improv team No Fun Mud Piranhas and at the Annoyance Theatre in Chicago as a part of Del Close 's <unk> at a time when the project was focused on competitive , long @-@ form improvisation , rather than improvisational comedy . " I wasn 't gonna do Second City " , Colbert later recalled , " because those Annoyance people looked down on Second City because they thought it wasn 't pure improv – there was a slightly snobby , mystical quality to the Annoyance people " . After Colbert graduated in 1986 , however , he was in need of a job . A friend who was employed at Second City 's box office offered him work answering phones and selling souvenirs . Colbert accepted and discovered that Second City employees were entitled to take classes at their training center for free . Despite his earlier aversion to the comedy group , he signed up for improvisation classes and enjoyed the experience greatly . 
 Shortly thereafter , he was hired to perform with Second City 's touring company , initially as an understudy for Steve Carell . It was there he met Amy Sedaris and Paul Dinello , with whom he often collaborated later in his career . By their retelling , the three comedians did not get along at first – Dinello thought Colbert was uptight , pretentious and cold , while Colbert thought of Dinello as " an illiterate thug " – but the trio became close friends while touring together , discovering that they shared a similar comic sensibility . 
 When Sedaris and Dinello were offered the opportunity to create a television series for HBO Downtown Productions , Colbert left The Second City and relocated to New York to work with them on the sketch comedy show Exit 57 . The series debuted on Comedy Central in 1995 and aired through 1996 . Although it lasted for only 12 episodes , the show received favorable reviews and was nominated for five CableACE Awards in 1995 , in categories including best writing , performance , and comedy series . 
 Following the cancellation of Exit 57 , Colbert worked for six months as a cast member and writer on The Dana Carvey Show , alongside former Second City castmate Steve Carell , and also Robert Smigel , Charlie Kaufman , Louis C.K. , and Dino <unk> , among others . The series , described by one reviewer as " kamikaze satire " in " borderline @-@ questionable taste " , had sponsors pull out after its first episode aired and was cancelled after seven episodes . Colbert then worked briefly as a freelance writer for Saturday Night Live with Robert Smigel . Smigel brought his animated sketch , The <unk> Gay Duo , to SNL from The Dana Carvey Show ; Colbert provided the voice of Ace on both series , opposite Steve Carell as Gary . Needing money , he also worked as a script consultant for VH1 and MTV , before taking a job filming humorous correspondent segments for Good Morning America . Only two of the segments he proposed were ever produced and only one aired , but the job led his agent to refer him to The Daily Show 's then @-@ producer , Madeline Smithberg , who hired Colbert on a trial basis in 1997 . 
 = = Television career = = 
 = = = Strangers with Candy = = = 
 During the same period , Colbert worked again with Sedaris and Dinello to develop a new comedy series for Comedy Central , Strangers with Candy . Comedy Central picked up the series in 1998 after Colbert had already begun working on The Daily Show . As a result , he accepted a reduced role , filming only around 20 Daily Show segments a year while he worked on the new series . 
 Strangers with Candy was conceived of as a parody of after school specials , following the life of Jerri Blank , a 46 @-@ year @-@ old dropout who returns to finish high school after 32 years of life on the street . Most noted by critics for its use of offensive humor , it concluded each episode by delivering to the audience a skewed , politically incorrect moral lesson . Colbert served as a main writer alongside Sedaris and Dinello , and portrayed Jerri 's strict but uninformed history teacher , Chuck Noblet , seen throughout the series dispensing inaccurate information to his classes . Colbert has likened this to the character he played on The Daily Show and later The Colbert Report , claiming that he has a very specific niche in portraying " poorly informed , high @-@ status idiot " characters . Another running joke throughout the series was that Noblet , a closeted homosexual , was having a " secret " affair with fellow teacher Geoffrey <unk> despite the fact that their relationship was apparent to everyone around them . This obliviousness also appears in Colbert 's Daily Show and Colbert Report character . 
 Thirty episodes of Strangers with Candy were made , which aired on Comedy Central in 1999 and 2000 . Though its ratings were not remarkable during its initial run , it has been characterized as a cult show with a small but dedicated audience . Colbert reprised his role for a film adaptation , which premiered at the Sundance Film Festival in 2005 and had a limited release in 2006 . The film received mixed reviews . Colbert also co @-@ wrote the screenplay with Sedaris and Dinello . 
 = = = The Daily Show = = = 
 Colbert joined the cast of Comedy Central 's parody @-@ news series The Daily Show in 1997 , when the show was in its second season . Originally one of four correspondents who filmed segments from remote locations in the style of network news field reporters , Colbert was referred to as " the new guy " on @-@ air for his first two years on the show , during which time Craig Kilborn served as host . When Kilborn left the show prior to the 1999 season , Jon Stewart took over hosting duties , also serving as a writer and co @-@ executive producer . From this point , the series gradually began to take on a more political tone and increase in popularity , particularly in the latter part of the 2000 U.S. presidential election season . The roles of the show 's correspondents were expanded to include more in @-@ studio segments and international reports , which were almost always done in the studio with the aid of a greenscreen . 
 Unlike Stewart , who essentially hosted The Daily Show as himself , Colbert developed a correspondent character for his pieces on the series . Colbert has described his correspondent character as " a fool who has spent a lot of his life playing not the fool – one who is able to cover it at least well enough to deal with the subjects that he deals with " . Colbert was frequently pitted against knowledgeable interview subjects , or against Stewart in scripted exchanges , with the resultant dialogue demonstrating the character 's lack of knowledge of whatever subject he is discussing . Colbert also made generous use of humorous fallacies of logic in explaining his point of view on any topic . Other Daily Show correspondents have adopted a similar style ; former correspondent Rob Corddry recalls that when he and Ed Helms first joined the show 's cast in 2002 , they " just imitated Stephen Colbert for a year or two " . Correspondent Aasif Mandvi has stated " I just decided I was going to do my best Stephen Colbert impression " . 
 Colbert appeared in several recurring segments for The Daily Show , including " Even <unk> " with Steve Carell , in which both characters were expected to debate a selected topic but instead would unleash their anger at one another . Colbert commonly hosted " This Week in God " , a report on topics in the news pertaining to religion , presented with the help of the " God Machine " . Colbert filed reports from the floor of the Democratic National Convention and the Republican National Convention as a part of The Daily Show 's award @-@ winning coverage of the 2000 and 2004 U.S. Presidential elections ; many from the latter were included as part of their The Daily Show : Indecision 2004 DVD release . Other pieces that have been named as his signature segments include " Grouse Hunting in Shropshire " , in which he reported on the " gayness " of British aristocracy , his mock <unk> of a smoking @-@ rights activist and apparent chain @-@ smoker , and his cameo appearances during his faux campaign for President . In several episodes of The Daily Show , Colbert filled in as anchor in the absence of Jon Stewart , including the full week of March 3 , 2002 , when Stewart was scheduled to host Saturday Night Live . After Colbert left the show , Rob Corddry took over " This Week in God " segments , although a recorded sample of Colbert 's voice is still used as the sound effect for the God Machine . Later episodes of The Daily Show have reused older Colbert segments under the label " Klassic <unk> " . Colbert won three Emmys as a writer of The Daily Show in 2004 , 2005 , and 2006 . 
 = = = The Colbert Report = = = 
 Colbert hosted his own television show , The Colbert Report , from October 17 , 2005 through December 18 , 2014 . The Colbert Report was a Daily Show spin @-@ off that parodied the conventions of television news broadcasting , particularly cable @-@ personality political talk shows like The O 'Reilly Factor and Glenn Beck . Colbert hosted the show in @-@ character as a blustery right @-@ wing pundit , generally considered to be an extension of his character on The Daily Show . Conceived by co @-@ creators Stewart , Colbert , and Ben Karlin in part as an opportunity to explore " the character @-@ driven news " , the series focused less on the day @-@ to @-@ day news style of the Daily Show , instead frequently concentrating on the foibles of the host @-@ character himself . 
 The concept for The Report was first seen in a series of Daily Show segments which advertised the then @-@ fictional series as a joke . It was later developed by Stewart 's Busboy Productions and pitched to Comedy Central , which greenlighted the program ; Comedy Central had already been searching for a way to extend the successful Daily Show franchise beyond a half @-@ hour . The series opened to strong ratings , averaging 1 @.@ 2 million viewers nightly during its first week on the air . Comedy Central signed a long @-@ term contract for The Colbert Report within its first month on the air , when it immediately established itself among the network 's highest @-@ rated shows . 
 Much of Colbert 's personal life was reflected in his character on The Colbert Report . With the extended exposure of the character on the show , he often referenced his interest in and knowledge of Catholicism , science fiction , and The Lord of the Rings , as well as using real facts to create his character 's history . His alternate persona was also raised in South Carolina , is the youngest of 11 siblings and is married . The actual Colbert 's career history in acting and comedy , however , was often downplayed or even denied outright , and he frequently referred to having attended Dartmouth College ( which was at the forefront of the conservative campus movement in the 1980s ) rather than his actual alma mater , Northwestern . In July 2012 , Colbert added two years to his contract with Comedy Central , extending the run of The Colbert Report until the end of 2014 . 
 The final episode on December 18 , 2014 featured a rendition of " We 'll Meet Again " and appearances from former guests of the show , including Jon Stewart , Randy Newman , Bryan Cranston , Willie Nelson , Yo Yo Ma , Mandy Patinkin , Neil <unk> Tyson , Tom Brokaw , David Gregory , J. J. Abrams , Big Bird , Gloria Steinem , Ken Burns , James Franco , Barry Manilow , Bob Costas , Jeff Daniels , Sam Waterston , Bill de Blasio , Katie Couric , Patrick Stewart , George Lucas , Henry Kissinger , Cookie Monster , Alan Alda , Eliot Spitzer , Vince Gilligan , Paul Krugman , and a text from Bill Clinton , and appearances of Alex Trebek , U.S. and coalition Afghanistan forces , and further characters ( a space station astronaut , Santa , Abraham Lincoln , etc . ) . 
 = = = Late Show = = = 
 On April 10 , 2014 , CBS announced in a press release that Colbert " will succeed David Letterman as the host of The Late Show , effective when Mr. Letterman retires from the broadcast . " On January 12 , 2015 , CBS announced that Colbert would premiere as the Late Show host on Tuesday , September 8 , 2015 . 
 The Late Show is taped in the Ed Sullivan Theater , which was renovated before Stephen Colbert debuted as the new host . Several architectural features of the original theater were restored including the theater 's domed ceiling ( which had been covered up ) and stained @-@ glass windows . 
 The first guest of the new Late Show was George Clooney . The show has a much more political focus than David Letterman 's Late Show .

 = = = 2006 White House Correspondents ' Association Dinner = = = 
 On Saturday , April 29 , 2006 , Colbert was the featured entertainer for the 2006 White House Correspondents ' Association Dinner . Standing a few yards from U.S. President George W. Bush – in front of an audience the Associated Press called a " Who 's Who of power and celebrity " – Colbert delivered a searing routine targeting the president and the media . In his politically conservative character from The Colbert Report , Colbert satirized the George W. Bush Administration and the White House Press Corps with such lines as : 
 I stand by this man . I stand by this man because he stands for things . Not only for things , he stands on things . Things like aircraft carriers and rubble and recently flooded city squares . And that sends a strong message , that no matter what happens to America , she will always rebound – with the most powerfully staged photo ops in the world . 
 Colbert received a chilly response from the audience . His jokes were often met with silence and muttering , apart from the enthusiastic laughter of a few in the audience . The major media outlets paid little attention to it initially . Washington Post columnist Dan <unk> and Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism professor Todd Gitlin claimed that this was because Colbert 's routine was as critical of the media as it was of Bush . Richard Cohen , also writing for The Washington Post , responded that the routine was not funny . The video of Colbert 's performance became an internet and media sensation , while , in the week following the speech , ratings for The Colbert Report rose by 37 % to average just under 1 @.@ 5 million total viewers per episode . In Time magazine James Poniewozik called it " the political @-@ cultural touchstone issue of 2006 " . Writing six months later , New York Times columnist Frank Rich referred to Colbert 's speech as a " cultural primary " and called it the " defining moment " of the 2006 midterm elections . 
 = = = 2008 Presidential bid = = = 
 Under his fictional persona in The Colbert Report , Colbert dropped hints of a potential presidential run throughout 2007 , with speculation intensifying following the release of his book , I Am America ( And So Can You ! ) , which was rumored to be a sign that he was indeed testing the waters for a future bid for the White House . On October 16 , 2007 , he announced his candidacy on his show , stating his intention to run both on the Republican and Democratic platforms , but only as a " favorite son " in his native South Carolina . He later abandoned plans to run as a Republican due to the $ 35 @,@ 000 fee required to file for the South Carolina primary , however he continued to seek a place on the Democratic ballot and on October 28 , 2007 , campaigned in the South Carolina state capital of Columbia , where he was presented with the key to the city by Mayor Bob Coble . 
 After announcing his presidential ticket , he asked his viewers to cast their votes by donating to <unk> , an online charity connecting individuals to classrooms in need . Colbert 's promotion inspired $ 68 @,@ 000 in donations to South Carolina classrooms , which benefited over 14 @,@ 000 low @-@ income students . Colbert teamed up with <unk> again in 2008 by asking supporters of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton to do the same . As a lead @-@ up to the Pennsylvania primary , he created a " straw poll that makes a difference " , where people could donate to Pennsylvania classroom projects in honor of their favorite candidate . Colbert viewers donated $ 185 @,@ 000 to projects reaching 43 @,@ 000 students in Pennsylvania public schools . 
 On November 1 , 2007 , the South Carolina Democratic Party executive council voted 13 – 3 to refuse Colbert 's application onto the ballot . " The general sense of the council was that he wasn 't a serious candidate and that was why he wasn 't selected to be on the ballot " , stated John Werner , the party 's director . In addition , he was declared " not viable " , as he was running in only one state . Several days later he announced that he was dropping out of the race , saying that he did not wish to put the country through an agonizing Supreme Court battle . CNN has reported that Obama supporters pressured the South Carolina Democratic Executive Council to keep Colbert off the ballot . One anonymous member of the council told CNN that former State Superintendent of Education Inez Tenenbaum had placed pressure on them to refuse Colbert 's application despite his steady rise in polls . 
 Though Colbert 's real @-@ life presidential campaign had ended , Marvel Comics editor @-@ in @-@ chief Joe Quesada established in an interview on The Colbert Report that Colbert 's campaign was still going strong in the fictional Marvel Universe , citing the cover art of a then @-@ recent issue of The Amazing Spider @-@ Man which featured a Colbert campaign billboard in the background . Background appearances of Colbert campaign ads continued to appear in Marvel Comics publications , as recently as August 2008 's Secret Invasion No. 5 ( which also features a cameo of an alien Skrull posing as Colbert ) .

 On September 24 , 2010 , Colbert testified in character before the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Immigration , Citizenship , and Border Security . He was invited by committee chairwoman Zoe Lofgren to describe his experience participating in the United Farm Workers ' " Take Our Jobs " program , where he spent a day working alongside migrant workers in upstate New York . At the end of his often @-@ humorous testimony , Colbert broke character in responding to a question from Rep. Judy Chu , D @-@ CA , and explained his purpose for being at the hearing : 
 I like talking about people who don 't have any power , and this seems like one of the least powerful people in the United States are migrant workers who come and do our work , but don 't have any rights as a result . And yet we still invite them to come here and at the same time ask them to leave . And that 's an interesting contradiction to me . And , you know , ' Whatsoever you do for the least of my brothers , ' and these seem like the least of our brothers right now ... Migrant workers suffer and have no rights . 
 Democratic committee member John Conyers questioned whether it was appropriate for the comedian to appear before Congress and asked him to leave the hearing . Though Colbert offered to depart at the direction of the committee chairwoman , Lofgren requested that he stay at least until all opening testimony had been completed , whereupon Conyers withdrew his request . 
 Conservative pundits took aim at Colbert 's Congress testimony not long after . 
 <unk> awkward and pointless , it made the committee 's majority members look ridiculous . Colbert can be very funny , but his kind of sarcasm only works in some contexts , and a House committee hearing room does not appear to be one of them . ' – Yuval Levin , The Corner 
 <unk> John Conyers notes , the media and spectators turned out to see whether Colbert would address the panel seriously as an expert on immigration and make the panel a joke , or stay in character and make the panel a bigger joke , ' – Ed Morrissey , Hot Air .

 The Rudra Mahalaya Temple is a ruined temple complex at Siddhpur in the Patan district of Gujarat , India . Its construction was started in 943 AD by <unk> and completed in 1140 AD by Siddharaj <unk> , the rulers of the Solanki dynasty . The temple was destroyed by Allauddin Khilji , and later Ahmed Shah I ( 1410 – 44 ) desecrated and substantially demolished this temple , and also converted part of it into the congregational mosque ( Jami Masjid ) of the city . Two <unk> ( porches ) and four pillars of the former central structure still stand along with western part of the complex used as mosque . 
 = = History = = 
 Siddhpur , historically known as <unk> . <unk> , under the rulers of Solanki dynasty , was a prominent town in the 10th century . In the tenth century ( 943 AD ) <unk> , the founder of the Solanki dynasty of Gujarat , started the erection of the Rudra <unk> temple . In his youth , <unk> had slain his maternal uncle , usurped his throne , and murdered the whole of his mother 's kindred ; and in old age his crimes hung heavily on his mind . He made pilgrimages and courted the favour of Brahmins from far and near . To a band of them he gave <unk> , and committing the kingdom to his son <unk> , he retired there to end his days in their company ( 996 AD ) . But the Rudra <unk> was still incomplete , nor was it finished till 1140 AD . 
 An inscription and ballad regarding its construction says , 
 In Samvat ten ( ? ) hundred , begun by Maharaj Mahadev , 
 In Samvat twelve hundred and two , Siddharaj completed the work ; 
 In Samvat twelve hundred two , Magh month , Krishna <unk> , 
 On Monday the fourteenth , in the <unk> Shravan and <unk> Yoga , 
 Siddharaj , in the Rudra Mala , <unk> established . 
 It was during the 12th century , in 1140 AD , that Siddharaj <unk> ( 1094 – 1144 ) consecrated the temple complex and it became the principal temple complex of Siddhpur . 
 According to another legend , two Parmars from Malwa , named <unk> and <unk> , took up their haunt among the rush grass that covered the neighbourhood of the Rudra Mahalaya , and lived by plunder . There they found the foundations of a temple and Shiva linga , and said that in the night they had seen heavenly beings . This was told to Siddharaj and led to the erection or completion of the temple . 
 In <unk> @-@ i @-@ Ahmadi , Ali Muhammad Khan writes , " The king on signifying his intention of building the temple , requested the astrologers , it is said , to appoint a fortunate hour ; and they at this time predicted the destruction of the building . " Then Siddha Raja caused images of " horse lords " and other great kings to be placed in the temple , and " near them a representation of himself in the attitude of supplication , with an inscription praying that , even if the land was laid waste , this temple might not be destroyed . " 
 Alauddin Khilji sent an army under Ulugh Khan and Nusrat Khan <unk> who dismantled the temple complex in 1296 AD ( Samvat 1353 ) . The temple was further destroyed and the western part of it was converted into congregational mosque ( Jami Mosque ) by Ahmed Shah I ( 1410 – 44 ) of Muzaffarid dynasty in 1414 or 1415 . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 The original temple , completed in 1140 to lavish proportions with extensive ornamentation , consisted of a roof measuring 32 feet ( 9 @.@ 8 m ) , much larger than the Abu temple . Its overall dimensions were 300 by 230 feet ( 91 m × 70 m ) with the central building 150 feet ( 46 m ) in length . It was a triple storied temple with 1 @,@ 600 pillars , 12 entrance doors , and 11 shrines of Rudra positioned around it . The sanctum was located on the west and there was also a ' mandapa ' or hall which had porches on the eastern , northern , and southern wings . Today only a few remnants of this complex are seen , such as two " <unk> " ( porches ) and four pillars . One " <unk> " is elaborately ornamented ; the eastern gate which leads to the Saraswati river still stands ; the remaining pillars have highly ornamented carvings . Kirti <unk> of North has survived . The western part of complex converted into the congregation mosque is also there . 
 = Tropical Storm Kammuri ( 2002 ) = 
 Severe Tropical Storm Kammuri , known in the Philippines as Tropical Storm Lagalag , killed hundreds of people in the wake of a deadly flood season in China . The system developed from a large monsoonal system that persisted toward the end of July 2002 near the Philippines . On August 2 , a tropical depression formed off the northwest coast of Luzon and moved west @-@ northwestward . Late on August 3 , it intensified into Tropical Storm Kammuri off the coast of Hong Kong . A weakening ridge turned the storm northward toward the coast of China . The storm made landfall with late on August 4 , after reaching peak winds of 100 km / h ( 65 mph ) . The system dissipated over the mountainous coastline of eastern China and merged with a cold front on August 7 . 
 High rainfall from Kammuri affected large portions of China , particularly in Guangdong Province where it moved ashore . In that province , over 100 @,@ 000 people had to evacuate due to flooding and after 6 @,@ 810 houses were destroyed . The floods damaged roads , railroads , and tunnels , and left power and water outages across the region . Rainfall was beneficial in alleviating drought conditions in Guangdong , although further inland the rains occurred after months of deadly flooding . In Hunan Province , the storm 's remnants merged with a cold front , destroying 12 @,@ 400 houses . Across its path , the floods damaged or destroyed 245 @,@ 000 houses and destroyed 60 ha ( 150 acres ) of crop fields . Kammuri caused 153 deaths , most of which were related to the remnants , and damage was estimated at $ 509 million ( ¥ 4 @.@ 219 billion yuan ) . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of Kammuri are uncertain ; they were possibly related to the monsoon trough that moved across the Philippines toward Guam . In late July , a large area of convection persisted in the Philippine Sea , organizing enough for the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration ( PAGASA ) to initiate advisories on Tropical Depression Lagalag on August 1 . Around that time , the system had several weak circulations , one of which persisted in the South China Sea ; this center was located east of an area of thunderstorms due to moderate wind shear . Early on August 2 , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) classified the system as a tropical depression to the north of Luzon . Shortly thereafter , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) followed suit by initiating advisories on Tropical Depression 17W , and the Hong Kong Observatory ( HKO ) followed suit early on August 3 . Initially , it moved generally to the west @-@ northwest , owing to a mid @-@ level ridge over eastern China . The convection became more concentrated , and the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Kammuri late on August 3 , to the south of Hong Kong . 
 An upper @-@ level low connected to a trough weakened the ridge over China , allowing Kammuri to move slowly northward . Continued wind shear initially prevented the thunderstorms from being located over the center , although the shear gradually decreased , allowing the convection to organize . Kammuri quickly intensified into a severe tropical storm ; the JMA estimated peak 10 @-@ minute sustained winds of 100 km / h ( 65 mph ) at 1800 UTC on August 4 . The JTWC estimated the storm was weaker , with 1 @-@ minute winds of 95 km / h ( 60 mph ) . At around 2300 UTC on August 4 , Kammuri made landfall east of Hong Kong in Guangdong Province , just east of Shanwei . An approaching mid @-@ latitude storm caused it to accelerate over land . Kammuri quickly weakened to a tropical depression , and the JTWC discontinued advisories at 1200 UTC on August 5 . The JMA continued tracking the system until Kammuri dissipated on August 7 over central China . The remnants were absorbed by a cold front . 
 = = Preparations , impact , and aftermath = = 
 On August 3 , when Kammuri was located about 390 kilometres ( 240 mi ) southeast of Hong Kong , the HKO issued Standby Signal No. 1 , the first such signal for a storm that season . By that time , the outer rainbands had begun affecting the region . Kammuri dropped heavy rainfall in Hong Kong that reached 280 mm ( 11 in ) in the town of Kwai Chung , most of which fell after the storm passed the region . The rains caused one landslide and damaged one road . Wind gusts in the city reached 99 km / h ( 62 mph ) , and sustained winds of 65 km / h ( 40 mph ) were reported on Waglan Island . There , a storm surge of 0 @.@ 49 m ( 1 @.@ 6 ft ) was also reported . In nearby Macau , outer rainbands delayed airplane flights , and there was some flooding . 
 In Guangdong Province where Kammuri made landfall , rainfall peaked at 275 mm ( 10 @.@ 8 in ) in <unk> , and several other stations reported totals of over 100 mm ( 3 @.@ 9 in ) . The rains caused flash flooding in the province , which destroyed 6 @,@ 810 houses , leaving thousands homeless . At Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport , officials delayed or canceled 56 flights because of the storm . Similarly , Shantou <unk> Airport was closed for four hours , which delayed or canceled 10 flights . Heavy damage was reported in three coastal cities . Two small electrical dams were destroyed by the storm , causing additional flooding . Widespread areas lost power or water , and floods damaged or destroyed roads , tunnels , and large areas of crop lands . The storm killed two people by electrocution in Shantou , and a landslide killed 10 people in <unk> County . Another landslide disrupted rail traffic between the region and Beijing . About 100 @,@ 000 people had to evacuate their houses in two cities . There were 27 deaths in the province , and damage was estimated at $ 109 million ( ¥ 904 million yuan ) . After the storm , provincial officials coordinated the rescue effort for missing people . Despite the destruction , the rainfall from Kammuri helped alleviate drought conditions in the province . However , elsewhere in China , the rainfall occurred after months of heavy rainfall had killed 800 people . 
 Neighboring Fujian Province to Guangdong experienced heavier rainfall , peaking at 315 mm ( 12 @.@ 4 in ) in Quanzhou . Two stations in the city reported the highest daily total on record . In a six @-@ hour period , a total of 104 mm ( 4 @.@ 1 in ) was recorded in <unk> County . Wind gusts reached 79 km / h ( 49 mph ) in Putian , Fujian . The province experienced river flooding due to the heavy rains ; the <unk> Stream crested at 34 @.@ 62 m ( 113 @.@ 6 ft ) in Yongtai County , which was above " danger " flood levels . Damage in the province totaled $ 131 million ( ¥ 1 @.@ 085 billion yuan ) . There were 19 deaths in Fujian .
