 Holly is a substitute teacher who makes her first appearance on Glee in the second season 's seventh episode , " The Substitute " . She is filling in at McKinley High School for the ailing Spanish teacher Will ( Matthew Morrison ) , who is also director of the glee club , New Directions . Club member Kurt ( Chris Colfer ) , who had seen her perform " Conjunction Junction " when she subbed for his English class , asks her to also take over Will 's glee club rehearsals . Instead of assigning songs , Holly asks the club members what kind of music they would like to perform , and when Puck ( Mark Salling ) suggests " Forget You " , she sings the song and they all join in , except for Rachel ( Lea Michele ) . Holly later wins her over by asking Rachel what she would like to sing that she hasn 't been able to , and they perform a number from Chicago together . Holly bonds with Sue ( Jane Lynch ) , who is the acting principal with Principal Figgins ( Iqbal Theba ) also out sick , and Sue fires the still @-@ ailing Will , making Holly the full @-@ time director of the glee club . When he recovers , Will confronts Holly at school , but she is unwilling to give up her new position . She later discovers she is in over her head when Mercedes ( Amber Riley ) gets in trouble , and Holly turns to Will for help . She reveals that she was once a more serious teacher like Will until a student punched her in the face , at which point she became far more free spirited . Holly ultimately returns to substitute teaching and Will is reinstated . He assigns the glee club to perform " Singin ' in the Rain " on his return , but faced with their dismay at being given another old song , he asks for Holly 's help to modernize it , and they all perform a mash @-@ up of it with Rihanna 's " Umbrella " . 
 Holly later returns to McKinley High as a substitute sex education teacher in the season 's fifteenth episode , " Sexy " . She informs Will that the members of New Directions are woefully ignorant about sex . He invites her to teach the glee club about safe sex , and she performs a rendition of Joan Jett 's " Do You Wanna Touch Me ( Oh Yeah ) " , much to the chagrin of the new head of the celibacy club , guidance counselor Emma ( Jayma Mays ) . Holly advises Puck and Lauren ( Ashley Fink ) that the sex tape they plan to make is illegal , as both are minors , and helps Brittany ( Heather Morris ) and Santana ( Naya Rivera ) start to come to terms with their true feelings for each other , later performing " Landslide " with them in front of the club . When Emma 's choice of " Afternoon Delight " as an abstinence song reveals her sexual naivete , her husband Carl ( John Stamos ) asks Holly for an appointment for him and Emma to work out issues in their sex life . During the counseling session , he reveals that Emma is still a virgin , and in answer to a question from Holly , Emma admits that she may still have feelings for Will . At the end of the episode , Holly begins a relationship with Will . 
 Holly makes her final second @-@ season appearance two episodes later in " A Night of Neglect " . She is still dating Will , and suggests to him that in order to help raise funds for the academic decathlon team , the glee club should present a benefit concert at the school that will feature songs by " neglected " artists . Her contribution to the benefit is a performance of Adele 's " Turning Tables " . At the end of the episode , realizing that he is still in love with Emma , Holly breaks up with Will and takes a several @-@ month substitute teaching job in another town .

 The role of Holly was created by series co @-@ creator Ryan Murphy specifically for Paltrow , a personal friend . Murphy suggested that she showcase her vocal and dancing talent ahead of the December 2010 release of the film Country Strong , in which Paltrow plays a country singer . Murphy said of Paltrow , " Gwyneth is a great singer . She 's done it a little bit but I really want to show it off and show everyone how great she is . " It was not the first time Paltrow had sung on screen : she played a karaoke singer in the movie Duets in 2000 , and had a number one hit in Australia for her duet of " <unk> ' " from its soundtrack . 
 The character was originally set to appear for two episodes , as a love interest for Will Schuester in a love quadrangle with Will , Emma and Carl . Her debut was subsequently reduced to a single episode , and the relationship plot removed . After " The Substitute " episode aired , Murphy expressed interest in having Paltrow return with the right storyline . A few months later , she confirmed she would be seen again on the series , and was initially supposed to appear in episodes fifteen and sixteen , but instead appeared in episodes fifteen and seventeen , " Sexy " and " A Night of Neglect " , the second of these being her final appearance . 
 Paltrow initially said about a possible return to Glee in its third season : " No , I don 't think so . I don 't think I should . Though it 's honestly been one of the best jobs I 've ever had . " She did later state that she would love to come back , and said that Holly was " probably the most fun character I 've ever gotten to play " . Murphy stated before the second season ended that he had plans for Paltrow to return in season three , though nothing specific has been mentioned since the beginning of the third season . Paltrow , however , was featured in Glee : The 3D Concert Movie after being filmed while she performed " Forget You " as Holly in the 2011 Glee Live ! In Concert ! tour performances of June 16 and 17 , 2011 .

 Paltrow 's performance in the " The Substitute " episode earned her an Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series and attracted critical praise . Indeed , at the time , Entertainment Weekly 's Tim Stack and E ! Online 's Kristin dos Santos called her appearance Emmy @-@ worthy , with the former rating it among her best performances , and the latter stating that Holly received " some of Glee 's best @-@ ever one @-@ liners . VanDerWerff wrote that Holly injected an effortless sense of fun , despite much of her plot being nonsensical . The Atlantic 's Meghan Brown commented that Paltrow " brought a massive spark to what could have been a one @-@ note role " , and her co @-@ author Kevin Fallon wrote that her energetic performance saved an episode that might have been " in shambles without her presence " . Robert Canning of IGN noted that Paltrow 's casting could have been distracting , but instead she fit the role " seamlessly " . Brett Berk of Vanity Fair found her " surprisingly great " , and James Poniewozik of Time stated that while her casting was somewhat distracting , she was able to make Holly a sympathetic character without overdoing her neediness and commitment @-@ phobia . However , the National Alliance on Mental Illness ( NAMI ) took exception Paltrow 's history classroom scene where she role @-@ plays as Mary Todd Lincoln , which it stated " mocked and trivialized bipolar disorder " . 
 Several critics preferred Paltrow 's return in the " Sexy " installment to her initial appearance . The Washington Post 's Emily Yahr felt that she was better integrated into this episode , and Raymund Flandez of the Wall Street Journal called her return " infinitely better " than her first appearance : " Back then , she was a puzzle , a loony bin . Here , she 's sly and quick @-@ witted , appropriately adult and seductively saucy in an episode that showcased more of her comedic timing , than her stiff dance skills . All the better for us . " Fallon wrote that Paltrow was " if possible , even sassier and sultrier " than before , and felt that she served to anchor a busy episode . In contrast , Sandra Gonzalez of Entertainment Weekly had mixed feelings about Holly and believed that she dominated screen time . VanDerWerff liked Paltrow 's acting , but disliked Holly 's interaction with Will , saying they lacked " chemistry " . Soraya Roberts of the Daily News disliked her return for prolonging Will and Emma 's separation , branding Holly a home @-@ wrecker . She commented that while Paltrow 's appearance in " The Substitute " was " relatively fresh " , in " Sexy " she was " acting almost like a cardboard cutout version of her former self , overly enunciating her lines [ and ] treading carefully around her choreography " . Poniewozik found all of Paltrow 's scenes " labored and ridiculous " , and wrote that the actress failed to bring an element of realism to her character . Canning said that " the moment she came on screen the whole episode lit up " , and the episode was a " fun and funny showcase for everybody 's favorite recurring character " , and Futterman echoed him when she called Paltrow " our new favorite cast member " . 
 Paltrow 's final appearance in the " A Night of Neglect " episode was met with divergent reactions . Both MTV journalist Aly Semigran and Gonzalez approved of Holly 's departure , the latter of whom stating that Glee writers gave the character an appropriate ending and rounded out her arc . In contrast , CNN writer Lisa Respers France was dismayed by the character 's exit and favored Holly 's " memorable " characterization in the episode . The Washington Post 's Lisa de Moraes expressed interest in a season three return , and Canning described Holly as " charming as ever " in the episode . Myles McNutt , writing for The A.V. Club , felt the installment " captured the occasional awkwardness of Paltrow 's presence on the show " , and wrote that casting such a prominent actress " has its disadvantages when you know that she 's only around on a temporary basis " . TVLine correspondent Michael Slezak noted that Will and Emma 's romance — and that Paltrow probably was not ready to commit to the series full @-@ time — led to Holly 's adieu . Slezak concluded that what he liked about Holly , was that she did not succumb to Will , which , according to Slezak , made him less annoying .

 Paltrow 's rendition of Cee Lo Green 's " Fuck You " , sanitized and retitled " Forget You " and featured on the soundtrack album Glee : The Music , Volume 4 , garnered positive critical reception . Anthony Benigno , an editor for the Daily News , and Time 's James Poniewozik criticized the show for sanitizing the song , but while the latter found it inferior to the original version , the former preferred Paltrow 's deeper voice and awarded it an " A " . Rolling Stone 's Erica Futterman felt the censorship of the song did not adversely affect its success , and deemed the performance " charming and sassy " . Megan Vick of Billboard favored it as " the most exciting number " of the episode , and Entertainment Weekly 's Tim Stack went further in his praise : he bestowed a grade of " A + " and lauded it as " one of the most memorable and energetic Glee performances ever , thanks in no small part to Paltrow " . Green expressed approval of the rendition . Benigno gave her short performance of " Conjunction Junction " an " A " , and described it as " a glorious ten seconds " , and granted the installment 's mash @-@ up of " Singin ' In The Rain / Umbrella " a " B " . Stack said that he loved the mash @-@ up and gave it an " A − " . Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times appreciated the mash @-@ up 's choreography and the manner in which " Paltrow 's sassiness undercuts [ Morrison 's ] overripe sweetness " , and named it potentially her favorite group number of the second season . " Forget You " reached number eleven on the Billboard Hot 100 and twelve on the Canadian Hot 100 , and the " Singing in the Rain / Umbrella " peaked at number ten on the Irish Singles Chart . Green 's " Fuck You ! " entered the top ten of the Hot 100 for the first time following the Glee cover , with sales rising 94 % in a week . 
 Most reviewers agreed that the performance of " Do You Wanna Touch Me ( Oh Yeah ) " was sexy . Benigno was one of these and was entertained by the number , but he thought Holly 's " vocals seem oddly subdued trying to imitate Joan Jett 's voice " and gave it a " B " grade . Gonzalez gave the same grade and also took issue with the vocals , though she enjoyed the energy . Futterman had a different view of the singing , and said that " Holly can 't quite muster Jett 's vocal power " . Berk gave the song four stars out of five and noted the " amazing hairography " , while Roberts called the performance a " leather @-@ clad , hair @-@ whipping mess " . Slezak gave the performance an " A " and wrote that Paltrow " completely captured the track 's naughty spirit " . " Do You Wanna Touch Me ( Oh Yeah ) " entered the Hot 100 at number fifty @-@ seven , and the Canadian Hot 100 at number sixty @-@ three . 
 There was not much enthusiasm for Morrison and Paltrow 's performance of Prince 's " Kiss " . BuddyTV 's Jen Harper noted that " Holly saved the song " for her . Futterman did not " feel the chemistry " until the final kiss . Benigno , on the other hand , said that the chemistry between them was " palpable " , called the cover " pretty great " , and gave it a " B + " . Roberts deemed Paltrow 's tango rigid , and The Atlantic author Patrick Burns commented that white people ought to be deterred from performing Prince . He called the music " uninteresting and soulless " , and was dismayed that the tango was " just white with white people tango dancing " . Flandez , however , enjoyed their dancing and wrote , " The strong holds , the slow cuts , the perfect swivel of hips and the lean @-@ to 's were mesmerizingly seductive . " " Kiss " charted at number eighty @-@ three on Hot 100 , and also made number eighty on the Canadian Hot 100 . 
 Paltrow 's performance of Fleetwood Mac 's " Landslide " received the most praise of the songs in the " Sexy " installment ; indeed , both VanDerWerff and Harper named it the episode 's best number . Harper noted the " great harmonies " and added , " I got goose bumps . " Houston Chronicle contributor Bobby Hankinson called the rendition " gorgeous " and Berk used " perfection " ; Berk went above his five star maximum to give the performance six stars . Roberts found the performance " pretty but uninspired " , though Flandez called it " a dreamy , perfectly pitched power song of lesbian love " and Poniewozik " surprisingly poignant " . Benigno and Slezak both noted that the cover was based on the version by the Dixie Chicks , and gave grades of " A − " and " B + " respectively . The " B + " from Gonzalez came with a caveat : she wished that Rivera , rather than Paltrow , had sung the lead vocal because of the meaning the song held for Santana . Stevie Nicks welcomed the cover of " Landslide " , and hoped it would bring the Fleetwood Mac 's songs to a new generation . She approved of the performance , and said that Paltrow " sang it beautifully " . On the Hot 100 , the rendition of " Landslide " debuted at number twenty @-@ three ; it was at number thirty @-@ five on the Canadian Hot 100 . 
 Paltrow 's performance of Adele 's " Turning Tables " was considered inferior to the original . While Flandez called it a " scene @-@ stealing turn " and commended it visually and vocally , he noted that Paltrow lacks Adele 's veracity . Futterman named it her least @-@ favorite of Paltrow 's covers to date and said that her vocals " lacked the texture that made Adele 's version so heartbreaking . " Gonzalez gave the performance her lowest grade of the episode , a " B – " , and Semigran opined that while Paltrow is " a nice enough singer , " she " in no way has the chops " the piece requires . McNutt characterized the decision to have Paltrow cover " Turning Tables " unfair in comparison to Adele 's original , " given that Paltrow 's singing is only passable " . Slezak , however , said that Paltrow delivered a controlled , understated performance and CNN 's Lisa Respers France simply deemed the performance memorable . The version reached number sixty @-@ six in the US and Canada . 
 = Papal conclave , 1492 = 
 The papal conclave of 1492 ( 6 – 11 August 1492 ) was convened after the death of Pope Innocent VIII ( 25 July 1492 ) . It was the first conclave to be held in the Sistine Chapel . 
 Cardinal Rodrigo Borja was elected unanimously on the 4th ballot as Pope Alexander VI . The election is notorious for allegations that Borja bought the votes of his electors , promising them lucrative appointments and other material gifts — a practice known as simony . Concerns about this conclave led Pope Julius II to create stronger rules against simony in 1503 . 
 = = Cardinal electors = = 
 Of the 23 cardinals participating in the conclave , fourteen had been elevated by Pope Sixtus IV . The Cardinals of Sixtus IV , known as the " Sistine Cardinals " and led by Giuliano della Rovere , had controlled the conclave of 1484 , electing one of their own , Giambattista Cibo as Pope Innocent VIII . Since 1431 the composition of the College of Cardinals had been radically transformed , increasing the number of cardinal @-@ nephews ( from 3 to 10 ) , crown @-@ cardinals ( from 2 to 8 ) , and representatives of powerful Roman noble families ( from 2 to 4 ) . With the exception of three curial officials and one pastor , the cardinals were " <unk> @-@ minded princes largely unconcerned with the spiritual life of either the Latin church or its members . " 
 At the time of Innocent VIII 's death , the names of Cardinals Gherardo and Sanseverino ( both created in <unk> ) , had not been published , thus making them ineligible to participate in the conclave ; however , both were published as an act of the College in sede vacante , Gherardo having been pushed by Orsini and Sanseverino by Sforza . Gherardo was assigned the title of Santi Nereo e <unk> , which it was believed Innocent VIII had intended for him ; Sanseverino was given the poor and undesirable diaconate of San Teodoro to ensure that the future pontiff would confirm his assignment . 
 According to the account of bishop ambassador Giovanni Andrea Boccaccio , at least seven cardinals considered themselves papabile , having dismantled the furnishings of their palaces as a precaution against the traditional pillaging of the pope @-@ elect 's residence by the Roman populace : da Costa , di <unk> , Michiel , Piccolomini , Domenico della Rovere , Savelli , and Zeno . 
 = = = Absent Cardinals = = = 
 There is no evidence that the 4 absent cardinals made an attempt to reach Rome for the conclave . 
 = = Procedures = = 
 As dictated by the prescriptions Ubi periculum and Ne Romani , the conclave should have begun on 4 August , ten days after the death of Innocent VIII ; however , the conclave was delayed to await the slow arrival of the aged Gherardo , bearing a letter from Venice 's Council of Ten urging his acceptance into the College . The cardinals had decided as early as their first meeting on 24 July to use the Sistine Chapel for the balloting and assembly of the conclave . 
 Johann Burchard , the German papal master of ceremonies , who presided over the conclave , as well as the previous one in 1484 , kept an extensive diary , noting that each cardinal was provided : 
 The Mass of the Holy Spirit ( celebrated by Giuliano della Rovere rather than Borja who as Dean would traditionally have been the celebrant ) and then a speech by Bernardino Lopez de Carvajal , a Spaniard and the ambassador to Ferdinand and Isabella , on the " evils afflicting the Church " preceded the beginning of the conclave on 6 August 1492 . Another Spaniard , Gonzalo Fernandez de Heredia , archbishop of Tarragona , was appointed prefect of the Vatican . Two important offices during sede vacante were filled with compatriots of Cardinal Borja , and it is believed that they both were chosen by Borja in his capacity as Dean to strengthen his position before the conclave . 
 The remainder of 6 August was consumed by the drafting and subscription to the conclave capitulation , which — although not extant — is known to have restricted the number of new cardinals which could be created by the new pope . 
 = = Vote count = = 
 The first ballot ( " scrutiny " ) , held on 8 August was said to have resulted in nine votes for Carafa , seven for Borja , Costa , and Michiel , and five for Giuliano della Rovere , with Sforza notably receiving zero votes . 
 The second ballot produced nine for Carafa , eight for Borja , seven for Michiel , and five for Giuliano della Rovere . 
 According to the Florentine Ambassador , one of the guards of the conclave , as of 10 August there had been three unsuccessful ballots , favoring Costa and Carafa , but in no way indicating Borja might be chosen . According to Sigismondo de ' Conti , papal secretary and chronicler , the vote was unanimous on the fourth ballot , taken early in the morning on 11 August although Borja had only 15 votes prior to the <unk> ; other accounts say Borja received all the votes except for his own , which he gave to Carafa . 
 According to the Catholic Encyclopedia , the election of Rodrigo Borja was " almost entirely due to " <unk> Orsini . 
 = = Allegations of simony = = 
 The Venetian envoy to Milan informed his <unk> in Ferrara : " that by simony and a thousand <unk> and indecencies the papacy has been sold , which is a disgraceful and detestable business " , adding that he expected Spain and France to withhold their support from the new pontiff . After the conclave , a ubiquitous epigram within Rome was : " Alexander sells the Keys , the Altar , Christ Himself — he has a right to for he bought them . " 
 On 10 August after the third ballot , Ascanio Sforza allegedly came to believe his own ambitions of being elected pope were impossible and became susceptible to Borja 's offer : the office of Vice @-@ Chancellor and the associated Palazzo Borgia , the Castle of <unk> , the bishopric of <unk> ( with annual revenue of 10 @,@ 000 ducats ) and other benefices . Sforza was also reputed to have received four mule @-@ loads of silver ( some sources say gold ) , which Borja ordered to be delivered immediately after the deal was struck . The price of the other Cardinals was as follows : Orsini , the fortified towns of Monticelli and Soriano , the legation of the Marches , and the bishopric of Cartagena ( with annual revenue of 5 @,@ 000 ducats ) ; Colonna , the abbey of Subiaco and its environs ( with annual revenue of 3 @,@ 000 ducats ) ; Savelli , Civita Castellana and the bishopric of Majorca ; Pallavicini , the bishopric of <unk> ( Pamplona ) ; Michiel , the suburbicarian see of Porto ; <unk> , Spanish benefices with annual income of 4 @,@ 000 ducats and the return of a house in the Piazza <unk> ( which Sforza had occupied ) to the children of Count Girolamo . Sanseverino 's compensation included Rodrigo Borgia 's house in Milan . Cardinals <unk> and Domenico della Rovere were to receive <unk> and / or benefices . Cardinals <unk> della Porta and Conti followed Sforza , whom they had originally supported . 
 The aforementioned Cardinals plus Borja 's own vote numbered 14 , one short of the required two @-@ third majority . However , Cardinals Carafa , Costa , Piccolomini , <unk> , and Zeno , followed by Medici , were unwilling to be bribed . Cardinal Giuliano della Rovere , followed by Basso , was <unk> opposed to Borja 's election . Thus , the ninety @-@ six @-@ year @-@ old Gherardo , the Cardinal Patriarch of Venice , who was paid only 5 @,@ 000 ducats , constituted the deciding vote . 
 According to Professor <unk> , who extensively researched the conclave and came to the conclusion that simony had occurred , no accounts of papal income and expenditure exist in the registers of <unk> et Exitus for August 1492 , and debts from the Apostolic Camera to Cardinals <unk> , Domenico della Rovere , Sanseverino , and Orsini appeared soon afterwards . The <unk> bank , which housed much of Borja 's wealth , was said to have nearly crashed after the conclave due to the velocity of transactions . 
 Some sources say that Charles VIII of France had bankrolled 200 @,@ 000 ducats ( plus 100 @,@ 000 ducats from the Doge of Genoa ) for the election of Giuliano della Rovere , although several otherwise <unk> cardinals were hostile to French interference . 
 Other historians regard politics as a stronger factor within the conclave than pure simony , with the personal <unk> between Giuliano della Rovere and Ascanio Sforza ( who had met to discuss the upcoming conclave in Castel Gandolfo even before Innocent VII had died ) substituting for the ancient struggle between Naples and Milan , with the intractability between the two parties making Borja a viable candidate . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 When Giuliano della Rovere was elected Pope Julius II in 1503 , he issued a bull annulling any papal election brought about by simony , and defrocking and excommunicating any cardinal who sold his vote . Although the twenty @-@ six day reign of Pope Pius III intervened between Alexander VI and Julius II , the alleged <unk> of the Borgia pope was still firmly in the institutional memory of the Roman Curia . While Cardinal during the reign of Alexander VI , Julius II had been assailed politically and often militarily outside the sturdy wall of his Castle of Ostia .

 The conclave is fictionalized in the 2011 premiere episode of the Showtime series " The Borgias " , with Jeremy Irons as Borja and Colm Feore as della Rovere , and also in the Borgia series of the same year , with John Doman as Rodrigo Borgia , Dejan <unk> as Giuliano Della Rovere , John Bradley as Giovanni De Medici and Predrag <unk> as Francesco Piccolomini . 
 = Adelaide Rams = 
 The Adelaide Rams were an Australian professional rugby league football club based in Adelaide , South Australia . The team was formed in 1995 for the planned rebel Super League competition , which eventually ran parallel to the rival Australian Rugby League ( ARL ) competition in 1997 . The Rams lasted two seasons , the first in the Super League competition in 1997 and the second in the first season of the National Rugby League ( NRL ) in 1998 . The Rams were not a successful club , winning only 13 out of 42 games . However crowd numbers in the first season were the fifth highest of any first @-@ grade club that year , but dwindled to sixteenth in the second season . The Adelaide club was shut down at the end of the 1998 season as a result of poor on @-@ field performances , dwindling crowd numbers , financial losses and a reduction in the number of teams in the NRL . They remain the only team from the state of South Australia to have participated in top @-@ level rugby league in Australia . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 The Australian rules football code , with origins as far back as 1843 , had long dominated sport in the state . South Australia had two teams competing in the national Australian rules competition , the Australian Football League ( AFL ) : the Adelaide Crows and Port Adelaide Power , the latter starting in the AFL in the same year as the Rams first season in Super League while the Crows won their first two AFL premierships in the same two years the Rams played . The new team from Port Adelaide , who already had a large fan base in the local South Australian National Football League ( SANFL ) competition , and the Crows successes in 1997 – 98 made it much harder for the Rams to compete for fan support . They were also competing against the popular Adelaide <unk> who played in the National Basketball League ( NBL ) which at the time ran a winter season . Adelaide , the capital of South Australia , was considered an Aussie rules stronghold , and in the SANFL had the oldest Aussie Rules Football league , and indeed the oldest league of any code , in Australia , as well as a viable Rugby Union competition which had been running since 1932 . The South Australian Rugby League ( SARL ) also had a First Grade Premiership competition in place since 1976 , while league been played competitively in Adelaide since the late 1940s . 
 The New South Wales Rugby League premiership ( NSWRL ) begun in 1908 , as a rugby league competition mostly for clubs in the Sydney region of Australia ( a team from Newcastle competed in 1908 – 09 ) , a situation that lasted until 1982 . The competition then expanded outside of NSW to Canberra , and to outside of Sydney with a team from Wollongong , and eventually in 1988 to Brisbane and the Gold Coast in Queensland , plus a new team from Newcastle . In 1992 the NSWRL decided to extend the competition further , by admitting four new teams for the 1995 competition , one from Western Australia , one from New Zealand and two from Queensland . The NSWRL also decided to test the viability of a rugby league team from the South Australian capital , and between 1991 and 1995 programmed five matches to be played in Adelaide at the famous Adelaide Oval . In 1991 , the St. George Dragons ( whose primary sponsor since the mid @-@ late 1970 's was Adelaide @-@ based winery <unk> ) and Balmain Tigers match attracted 28 @,@ 884 people , the largest attendance for any rugby league game in South Australia and the largest of the entire minor round of the 1991 NSWRL season ( it was in fact the 5th highest attendance for the entire season , beating the attendance of two of the six Finals series games ) . Around 20 @,@ 000 attended the two matches in 1992 and 1993 , and around 10 @,@ 000 in 1994 and 1995 . Despite this evidence of popular appeal , the NSWRL , already in the process of setting up a 20 @-@ team competition , could not see their way to admitting a team from Adelaide and their preferred option outside of rugby league strongholds of NSW , Qld and New Zealand was to have a team from Melbourne and another in Perth ( the Melbourne Storm would be formed in 1998 ) . By the end of 1995 , this was apparent as the ARL had already played two international Test matches involving the Australian Kangaroos in Melbourne , as well as three State of Origin games , with Game 2 of the 1994 State of Origin series attracting a then Australian record rugby league crowd of 87 @,@ 161 to the Melbourne Cricket Ground . 
 = = = Formation = = = 
 In 1994 , the media company News Limited began developing a rival competition to the long @-@ established NSWRL premiership : the " Super League " premiership . In response to this move the Australian Rugby League ( ARL ) , the governing body of rugby league in Australia , took over the NSWRL . After 8 of the 20 teams in the ARL competition signed with News Limited ( to play in their proposed Super League competition in 1996 ) the organization began looking for further teams to make the new competition viable . In June 1995 the South Australian Rugby League ( SARL ) , which governs the game of rugby league in South Australia , officially signed with Super League , who subsequently gave them a licence to form a franchise which would allow the SARL to create a Super League team . Another leading factor in the SARL 's decision to sign with SL was the promise of greater financial assistance than they were receiving from the ARL . 
 The team was owned and supported by News Limited . Former Australian representatives Tim Pickup and Rod Reddy were named inaugural CEO and head coach respectively . Pickup played a major role in assembling the playing roster as well as establishing training headquarters , and was the Rams delegate for all of the Super League court hearings . No expense was spared converting a former sanitarium in the suburb of <unk> into a world @-@ class sporting complex , later named Ram Park , that was home to the largest weight @-@ lifting gym in the southern hemisphere . 
 On 13 December 1995 , the SARL officially launched the ' Adelaide Rams ' , the tenth and final team to join the Super League competition . In early March , the ARL were successful in gaining a federal court injunction , a legal ruling that prevented the Super League from beginning competition in 1996 and the Rams were put on hold causing Tim Pickup to stand down from his post in the ensuing months . In mid @-@ 1996 , News Limited successfully appealed this ruling , which enabled the competition to proceed . Wallaby rugby union halfback George Gregan was approached to switch codes to be the starting halfback for the new team for " seriously more money than " he would earn playing rugby union , though he opted to remain in the 15 @-@ man code ( Gregan would ultimately go on to win the 1999 Rugby World Cup with the Wallabies and would become Wallaby captain in 2001 ) . The first , and only Super League season , was held in 1997 , and the Rams were part of it . 
 = = = Inaugural season = = = 
 SARL appointed the former Auckland Warriors marketing manager Liz Dawson as Pickup 's replacement as the Rams ' chief executive – the first female chief executive of any rugby league club in either the ARL or the Super League . The club had appointed St. George Dragons international back rower Rod Reddy to be their inaugural coach , along with two @-@ time NSWRL premiership @-@ winning Hooker <unk> Walters from the Brisbane Broncos to be the first captain of the team . Most of the junior players were drawn from the SARL 's lower grade competitions in the region . 
 The club played its first premiership match against the North Queensland Cowboys and , after leading 16 – 4 at half time , eventually lost 24 – 16 . 
 Their first home match , against the Hunter Mariners , was also the Rams ' first win , and drew their record home attendance of 27 @,@ 435 to the Adelaide Oval , one of only two home wins for the season . The Rams also won four away games with their first being in Round 4 against the Auckland Warriors at the Ericsson Stadium in Auckland , New Zealand , but their overall record of 6 wins , 11 losses and 1 draw placed them second last on the Super League premiership ladder , one win ahead of North Queensland . 
 The Rams first home game attendance of 27 @,@ 435 was the 4th highest attendance of the entire 1997 season , behind only the Grand Final at the ANZ Stadium in Brisbane ( 58 @,@ 912 ) , the opening game of the season in Brisbane ( 42 @,@ 361 ) and a Round 6 match at the Dairy Farmers Stadium in Townsville ( 30 @,@ 122 ) . 
 Although the Rams had good home attendances in 1997 , unfortunately for the new club this was the same year that the Port Adelaide Power began to play in the AFL . Port Adelaide were the most successful and well supported club in the local Australian rules competition , the SANFL . This made the Rams job of attracting new fans even harder . This job was made even harder when the Adelaide Crows won their first AFL premiership that year . 
 Goal kicking utility back Kurt Wrigley was the Rams top point scorer for the season with 81 points from 5 tries , 30 goals and 1 field goal . Wrigley and fullback Rod <unk> were the teams top try scorers with 5 each . Super League 's top point scorer for the season was Penrith Panthers centre Ryan Girdler who scored 197 points from 11 tries , 76 goals and 1 field goal . The competitions top try scorer was Canterbury Bulldogs utility back Matthew Ryan who crossed for 17 tries . 
 Following the unification of the Super League and ARL competitions after the 1997 season , a new National Rugby League ( NRL ) competition was formed . This meant that three teams would be <unk> , as part of the rationalisation process aimed at reducing teams to an optimal number . With the introduction of the Melbourne Storm , and an agreement between Super League and the ARL to have a competition limited to 14 teams by 2000 , the future for the Rams looked bleak . However , the Rams ' home ground support , which averaged 15 @,@ 330 fans each week , ensured that they remained in the unified 1998 competition .

 In addition to the Telstra Cup , the Adelaide Rams also competed in Super League 's 1997 World Club Championship competition . The Rams were placed in Australasia Pool B along with the Hunter Mariners , North Queensland Cowboys and Perth Reds and would be matched up against teams from Europe Pool B including the Leeds Rhinos , Oldham Bears and Salford City Reds . The competition would see the Rams play three games at home and three in England . 
 The Rams won their three home games rather easily , but only managed to win one of their games in England leaving them in third place in their pool . As only one team from Australasia Pool B would go on to the Quarter finals , this meant that the Adelaide Rams did not advance past the group stage of the tournament .

 The demise of three clubs from the Super League and ARL ( Western Reds and Hunter Mariners ( SL ) , and South Queensland Crushers ( ARL ) ) saw some player re @-@ shuffling , and brought Noel Goldthorpe , Tony Iro and Matt Daylight to the Adelaide club . However , after the Rams lost nine of their first ten games , coach Reddy and the entire coaching staff were sacked by the Rams ' administration . Reddy was replaced by former Perth Reds coach Dean Lance and mid @-@ season saw the arrival of Canberra Raiders utility back Graham Appo . 
 In June after numerous financial disagreements with the South Australian Cricket Association ( SACA ) who at the time owned the Adelaide Oval , the club changed home grounds to the smaller , 16 @,@ 000 capacity Hindmarsh Stadium , a soccer specific venue which was better suited to a rugby league field than the Adelaide Oval was . The Rams celebrated the move with a record 52 – 0 win over the Balmain Tigers . 
 The club went on to win six of their last fourteen games after Lance 's arrival , enough to avoid the wooden spoon awarded to the team finishing lowest on the competition ladder . Their overall results were comparable to those of their first season , coming fourth last in the 20 – team competition . Appo broke several team records in his 14 games with the Rams . 
 The Adelaide Rams last home game in the penultimate round of the season saw a 36 – 0 thrashing at the hands of the finals bound North Sydney Bears in front of 7 @,@ 035 fans on 15 August 1998 . 
 Throughout the 1998 season , the Rams attempted to build a stronger supporter base in order to avoid removal from the competition in 1999 or 2000 . However , with the teams lack of on @-@ field success , plus the success of other Adelaide @-@ based sports teams who won national championships in 1997 and / or 1998 including the Adelaide Crows ( AFL ) , Adelaide <unk> ( NBL ) and Adelaide Thunderbirds ( netball ) , saw average home attendances dropped by more than half ( 51 @.@ 3 % ) from the previous years 15 @,@ 330 to just 7 @,@ 472 over the course of the season . 
 The NRL had planned to continue a 20 – team competition in 1999 , with a reduction to 14 teams in 2000 . The Rams ' management , led by newly named CEO , former dual rugby international and Manly @-@ Warringah 1987 premiership player Michael O 'Connor , had their minds set on a place in the reduced competition , and went on a buying spree , obtaining rights for players that they hoped would be productive enough for the team to survive the cut in 2000 . However , after the merger between rugby league clubs St. George Dragons and Illawarra Steelers , News Limited told the Rams they would no longer receive funding . The club was wound up just days after it had held its 1999 season launch . With little chance of securing a contract with another club just weeks before the start of the 1999 NRL season , the players were then placed in other News Ltd. owned or financed teams including Brisbane , Canberra and Melbourne . 
 The cost of building and sustaining an uncompetitive rugby league team in an area dominated by another football sport had resulted in News Limited incurring heavy financial losses with the Rams . Subsequent attempts to merge with a Sydney club ( rumoured to be the ARL loyal South Sydney Rabbitohs ) failed , however the Canberra Raiders offered to merge with the club and effectively took over the club on 1 December 1998 . 
 You cannot expect the Rams to have won over South Australians after just two seasons in such an Aussie Rules stronghold , especially given the extraordinary nature of those seasons . 
 = = = Future = = = 
 While the Adelaide Rams cease to no longer exist in their own right , numbers in junior rugby league in Adelaide have risen , and the SARL has begun again to promote the idea of a team based in Adelaide . Due to its efforts , NRL teams have been brought to the city to revive interest ; in 2006 the Penrith Panthers scheduled a home game at Adelaide 's Hindmarsh Stadium while their home ground was under renovation . The NRL helped with the promotion of the match , although the SARL were disappointed with the small crowd of 7 @,@ 017 . In 2008 , Sydney based club the Cronulla Sharks announced they would play three matches over the next three years at Adelaide , with coach Ricky Stuart saying he wanted Adelaide to become the Sharks ' second home . SARL general manager Bruce Walker has suggested that the NRL itself should take more responsibility for scheduling games in Adelaide . The 2009 match against North Queensland Cowboys attracted 8 @,@ 547 people . However , at the end of the 2008 NRL season , the leagues Centenary year , the Sharks decided to concentrate on their home fans and were allowed out of their contract to play in Adelaide after just one game . 
 In 2010 , the Canterbury @-@ Bankstown Bulldogs took their home match against the Melbourne Storm to Adelaide in which Canterbury @-@ Bankstown Bulldogs defeating the Melbourne Storm 20 – 18 where the game attracted 10 @,@ 350 people at Adelaide Oval . 
 In 2008 , several NRL club bosses expressed the view that the NRL should be a " national " competition , since it now had teams from all around Australia rather than just on the eastern seaboard , arguing that such a move would increase the competition 's revenue . Peter Parr , the CEO of the North Queensland Cowboys and former assistant coach for the Rams in 1998 , said that if the NRL had stuck with the Adelaide Rams , then rugby league in Adelaide might have flourished , making comparisons with the Melbourne Storm , a team performing successfully on and off the field in the AFL 's heartland . 
 Early in the 2013 NRL season , the NRL 's official free @-@ to @-@ air broadcast partner the Nine Network , began to show their Friday night and Sunday afternoon games live around Australia , including Adelaide , on their digital channel GEM . This saw games shown during prime time on Friday nights from 7pm , and from 4pm on Sundays ( following the The Sunday Footy Show which prior to 2013 had never been broadcast into Adelaide ) rather than in the post midnight ' graveyard shift ' of previous years . It also saw NRL broadcasts go head @-@ to @-@ head with live AFL telecasts on the Seven Network with predictably lower ratings in Australian rules dominated states South Australia , Western Australia and Victoria . While this agreement is still in place around Australia during 2014 , for unexplained reasons the showing of games in Adelaide only has reverted to the graveyard shift , a move which has angered league fans in Adelaide . 
 Prior to the start of the 2015 NRL season , ABC news reported that successful Sydney based club the Manly @-@ Warringah Sea Eagles were in talks with the South Australian Government with the view to bring some future Sea Eagles home games to Adelaide . 
 = = Colours , emblem and stadium = = 
 The emblem of the team was a ram ( a male sheep ) . The ram was chosen , according to Super League chief executive John Ribot , because it was " readily identifiable with strength and hardness " . This name was considered a better alternative to the first choice , the Adelaide Aces ( through a proposed sponsorship link with the Adelaide Casino ) , which Ribot believed was too soft a name and did not work well as a brand for a Super League team . The main colours of the Adelaide Rams were red and blue , although there was yellow in their emblem to reflect South Australia 's traditional sporting colours . Their jerseys remained red and blue until the last game they played in 1998 , when they used a mainly yellow jersey to avoid a colour clash with the similar jerseys of the Newcastle Knights ( who were the home team ) . 
 The Rams ' initial home ground was Adelaide Oval , a round park that had been used for cricket and Australian Rules Football for over a century . For their first season they had average home attendances of 15 @,@ 330 , the fourth highest of the Super League teams and fifth highest of all 22 teams in both competitions . In 1998 , however , the Rams ' home attendances diminished , dropping to an average of about 7 @,@ 500 , the fourth lowest of any team in the 20 – team competition . 
 During 1998 , the South Australian Cricket Association had ongoing problems with the SARL and the Rams ' use of their stadium , Adelaide Oval . The Rams then moved to Hindmarsh Stadium , a rectangular stadium more suited to rugby league and owned by the South Australian Soccer Association . They celebrated with a 52 – 0 defeat over Balmain in their first match at the stadium . However , attendances did not improve after the move , falling below 7 @,@ 500 . 
 The Rams highest attendance at Adelaide Oval was 27 @,@ 435 set in their inaugural home game against the Hunter Mariners . Their record attendance at Hindmarsh was 7 @,@ 459 for their loss to 1997 ARL Grand Finalists , the Manly @-@ Warringah Sea Eagles . In 1998 , the Rams played their Round 15 home game against the Illawarra Steelers at the Bennett Oval in Whyalla , in part due to Whyalla 's main employer being BHP who were also the Steelers major sponsor . The Steelers won the game 39 – 4 in front of 5 @,@ 153 fans .

 = Acquisition ( Star Trek : Enterprise ) = 
 " Acquisition " is the nineteenth episode of the first season of the American science fiction television series Star Trek : Enterprise that originally aired on March 27 , 2002 , on UPN . The episode was developed into a teleplay by Maria and Andre Jacquemetton from a story by Rick Berman and Brannon Braga , and was directed by James Whitmore , Jr .. Set in the 22nd century , the series follows the adventures of the first Starfleet starship , Enterprise , registration NX @-@ 01 . In this episode , a group of interstellar alien thieves knock out the Enterprise crew and begin looting the ship . Commander Charles " Trip " Tucker III ( Connor Trinneer ) is the only one left to stop them . 
 The Ferengi first appeared in the Star Trek : The Next Generation episode " The Last Outpost " , and first contact with the race was described in " The Battle " , which meant that " Acquisition " attempted to not alter that . In addition , a Ferengi language was developed by the writers which was based on French . The episode also had a number of guest stars who had previously appeared in Star Trek ; Clint Howard , Ethan Phillips and Jeffrey Combs . It was poorly received by critics , but according to the Nielsen ratings , it received a 5 @.@ 2 / 6 % audience share during broadcast . 
 = = Plot = = 
 As Enterprise drifts in space , an unknown alien cruiser scans the ship , then docks with it . As part of an unconventional and criminal first contact , two Ferengi , Muk and <unk> , board wearing breathing filters , and the crew appear to have been knocked unconscious . In Engineering , the two locate and deactivate a gas @-@ machine that the Starfleet crew brought up from the surface of a nearby moon . Unknown to the intruders , Commander Tucker is still conscious and makes his way to Engineering and uses the ship 's sensors to monitor the aliens as they plunder the ship . 
 Captain Archer is confined in <unk> , and the aliens are unconvinced that Enterprise carries no currency or valuable materials . They set @-@ off to find the vault themselves , leaving Krem and Archer to transfer the loot . Archer sees Tucker and sends him to the launch @-@ bay to retrieve the Ferengi 's <unk> . Doing so , Tucker revives Sub @-@ Commander T 'Pol , and they try to find a way to stop the Ferengi . She assumes the gas @-@ machine was intentionally placed on the surface as a ' Trojan Horse ' . In Sickbay , three of the four Ferengi search for the non @-@ existent vault , and T 'Pol uses a PADD to distract and then start an argument between them . 
 In Engineering , Archer tries to negotiate with Krem , who is tempted when Archer says that he will throw in T 'Pol . In Archer 's quarters , Muk and <unk> try interrogating Porthos , Archer 's pet Beagle . Muk goes to the launch @-@ bay and finds Tucker , who escapes , but Ulis subdues him with his electro @-@ whip . The Ferengi , Archer and Trip meet in the launch @-@ bay where Archer plays along with Tucker 's deception about " the vault " . T 'Pol assists in subduing the intruders , and the crew oversee the return of the stolen goods . Archer tells the Ferengi not to go within a light year of a human or Vulcan vessel ever again ( and they indeed do not reappear until some 200 years later in episode The Last Outpost ) . 
 = = Production = = 
 The writers of " Acquisition " , Maria and Andre Jacquemetton , developed a spoken language for the alien race known as the Ferengi . Although they had been seen previously on screen in previous incarnations of Star Trek , including throughout Star Trek : Deep Space Nine , a spoken language had not been developed . The pair wrote the dialogue initially in English , before translating it into French and then breaking it down into syllables . They described it as " fun to write " . The pair had intended for the Ferengi throughout the episode to speak their new language , but this was reduced to only the first act . This was the third episode written by the duo , after " Breaking the Ice " and " Dear Doctor " . 
 Story editor André Bormanis explained in a web chat just before the airing of the episode that they had sought to ensure that Jean @-@ Luc Picard was Captain who made first contact with the Ferengi officially ; Bormanis commented that he thought the episode was funny . The Ferengi made their first appearance in the Star Trek : The Next Generation episode " The Last Outpost " , having been created by franchise creator Gene Roddenberry and producer Herbert Wright . The events of the episode " The Battle " established that it was Picard on board the USS Stargazer at the Battle of Maxia that made the official first contact with the race on behalf of the Federation . 
 The guest cast featured three former Star Trek alumni including Clint Howard who had appeared in the Star Trek : The Original Series episode " The <unk> Maneuver " as <unk> . Ethan Phillips had appeared as Neelix , a main cast character in Star Trek : Voyager , as well as the Ferengi doctor <unk> in The Next Generation episode " Ménage à Troi " . The third alumni was Jeffrey Combs who had appeared as several characters such as Weyoun and the Ferengi Brunt in Star Trek : Deep Space Nine . Combs had already previously in Enterprise as the Andorian Shran , and would continue to do so for the rest of the series . He said that being asked to appear as a Ferengi once again took him by surprise , but that Krem was " a world 's away " from the Brunt character , which pleased him . 
 = = Reception and home media release = = 
 " Acquisition " originally aired on UPN on March 27 , 2002 . According to Nielsen ratings , it received a 5 @.@ 2 / 6 % share , meaning that it was seen by 5 @.@ 2 percent of all households , and 6 percent of all households watching television at the time of the broadcast . 
 Herc , in his review for Ain 't It Cool News , compared to the Die Hard inspired episode of Alias entitled " The Box " . He thought that the Enterprise episode wasn 't as good and suggested it might have been a filler episode . He gave it a rating of two and a half out of five . Alasdair Wilkins , at the A.V. Club described the episode as " Star Trek comfort food " , but also that it demonstrated " a show unable to carve out its own identity , content to rehash old stories when the show ’ s very premise demands new storytelling " . He also said that it was a " blatant example " of Enterprise repeating the story mechanics of previous seasons . Chaz Lipp at The Morton Report called " Acquisition " a " goofy " episode , and one of several which were " weak and uninspired " . 
 The first home media release of the episode was on VHS in the UK on September 23 , 2002 . It was first released in the United States on DVD , having been released as part of the season one box set during May 2005 . The Blu @-@ ray release of Enterprise was released in the United States on March 26 with the UK release following on April 1 . 
 = Mobility analogy = 
 The mobility analogy , also called admittance analogy or Firestone analogy , is a method of representing a mechanical system by an analogous electrical system . The advantage of doing this is that there is a large body of theory and analysis techniques concerning complex electrical systems , especially in the field of filters . By converting to an electrical representation , these tools in the electrical domain can be directly applied to a mechanical system without modification . A further advantage occurs in electromechanical systems : Converting the mechanical part of such a system into the electrical domain allows the entire system to be analysed as a unified whole . 
 The mathematical behaviour of the simulated electrical system is identical to the mathematical behaviour of the represented mechanical system . Each element in the electrical domain has a corresponding element in the mechanical domain with an analogous constitutive equation . All laws of circuit analysis , such as Kirchhoff 's laws , that apply in the electrical domain also apply to the mechanical mobility analogy . 
 The mobility analogy is one of the two main mechanical @-@ electrical analogies used for representing mechanical systems in the electrical domain , the other being the impedance analogy . The roles of voltage and current are reversed in these two methods , and the electrical representations produced are the dual circuits of each other . The mobility analogy preserves the topology of the mechanical system when transferred to the electrical domain whereas the impedance analogy does not . On the other hand , the impedance analogy preserves the analogy between electrical impedance and mechanical impedance whereas the mobility analogy does not . 
 = = Applications = = 
 The mobility analogy is widely used to model the behaviour of mechanical filters . These are filters that are intended for use in an electronic circuit , but work entirely by mechanical vibrational waves . Transducers are provided at the input and output of the filter to convert between the electrical and mechanical domains . 
 Another very common use is in the field of audio equipment , such as loudspeakers . Loudspeakers consist of a transducer and mechanical moving parts . Acoustic waves themselves are waves of mechanical motion : of air molecules or some other fluid medium . 
 = = Elements = = 
 Before an electrical analogy can be developed for a mechanical system , it must first be described as an abstract mechanical network . The mechanical system is broken down into a number of ideal elements each of which can then be paired with an electrical analogue . The symbols used for these mechanical elements on network diagrams are shown in the following sections on each individual element . 
 The mechanical analogies of lumped electrical elements are also lumped elements , that is , it is assumed that the mechanical component possessing the element is small enough that the time taken by mechanical waves to propagate from one end of the component to the other can be neglected . Analogies can also be developed for distributed elements such as transmission lines but the greatest benefits are with lumped element circuits . Mechanical analogies are required for the three passive electrical elements , namely , resistance , inductance and capacitance . What these analogies are is determined by what mechanical property is chosen to represent voltage , and what property is chosen to represent current . In the mobility analogy the analogue of voltage is velocity and the analogue of current is force . Mechanical impedance is defined as the ratio of force to velocity , thus it is not analogous to electrical impedance . Rather , it is the analogue of electrical admittance , the inverse of impedance . Mechanical admittance is more commonly called mobility , hence the name of the analogy . 
 = = = Resistance = = = 
 The mechanical analogy of electrical resistance is the loss of energy of a moving system through such processes as friction . A mechanical component analogous to a resistor is a shock absorber and the property analogous to inverse resistance ( conductance ) is damping ( inverse , because electrical impedance is the analogy of the inverse of mechanical impedance ) . A resistor is governed by the constitutive equation of Ohm 's law , 
 <formula> 
 The analogous equation in the mechanical domain is , 
 <formula> 
 where , 
 G = 1 / R is conductance 
 R is resistance 
 v is voltage 
 i is current 
 Rm is mechanical resistance , or damping 
 F is force 
 u is velocity induced by the force . 
 Electrical conductance represents the real part of electrical admittance . Likewise , mechanical resistance is the real part of mechanical impedance . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 The mechanical analogy of inductance in the mobility analogy is compliance . It is more common in mechanics to discuss stiffness , the inverse of compliance . A mechanical component analogous to an inductor is a spring . An inductor is governed by the constitutive equation , 
 <formula> 
 The analogous equation in the mechanical domain is a form of Hooke 's law , 
 <formula> 
 where , 
 L is inductance 
 t is time 
 Cm = 1 / S is mechanical compliance 
 S is stiffness 
 The impedance of an inductor is purely imaginary and is given by , 
 <formula> 
 The analogous mechanical admittance is given by , 
 <formula> 
 where , 
 Z is electrical impedance 
 j is the imaginary unit 
 ω is angular frequency 
 <unk> is mechanical impedance . 
 = = = Capacitance = = = 
 The mechanical analogy of capacitance in the mobility analogy is mass . A mechanical component analogous to a capacitor is a large , rigid weight . A capacitor is governed by the constitutive equation , 
 <formula> 
 The analogous equation in the mechanical domain is Newton 's second law of motion , 
 <formula> 
 where , 
 C is capacitance 
 M is mass 
 The impedance of a capacitor is purely imaginary and is given by , 
 <formula> 
 The analogous mechanical admittance is given by , 
 <formula> . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 A curious difficulty arises with mass as the analogy of an electrical element . It is connected with the fact that in mechanical systems the velocity of the mass ( and more importantly , its acceleration ) is always measured against some fixed reference frame , usually the earth . Considered as a two @-@ terminal system element , the mass has one terminal at velocity ' ' u ' ' , analogous to electric potential . The other terminal is at zero velocity and is analogous to electric ground potential . Thus , mass cannot be used as the analogue of an ungrounded capacitor . 
 This led Malcolm C. Smith of the University of Cambridge in 2002 to define a new energy storing element for mechanical networks called inertance . A component that possesses inertance is called an inerter . The two terminals of an inerter , unlike a mass , are allowed to have two different , arbitrary velocities and accelerations . The <unk> equation of an inerter is given by , 
 <formula> 
 where , 
 F is an equal and opposite force applied to the two terminals 
 B is the inertance 
 u1 and u2 are the velocities at terminals 1 and 2 respectively 
 <unk> = u2 − u1 
 <unk> has the same units as mass ( kilograms in the SI system ) and the name indicates its relationship to inertia . Smith did not just define a network theoretic element , he also suggested a construction for a real mechanical component and made a small prototype . Smith 's inerter consists of a plunger able to slide in or out of a cylinder . The plunger is connected to a rack and pinion gear which drives a flywheel inside the cylinder . There can be two counter @-@ rotating flywheels in order to prevent a torque developing . Energy provided in pushing the plunger in will be returned when the plunger moves in the opposite direction , hence the device stores energy rather than dissipates it just like a block of mass . However , the actual mass of the inerter can be very small , an ideal inerter has no mass . Two points on the inerter , the plunger and the cylinder case , can be independently connected to other parts of the mechanical system with neither of them necessarily connected to ground . 
 Smith 's inerter has found an application in Formula One racing where it is known as the J @-@ damper . It is used as an alternative to the now banned tuned mass damper and forms part of the vehicle suspension . It may have been first used secretly by McLaren in 2005 following a collaboration with Smith . Other teams are now believed to be using it . The inerter is much smaller than the tuned mass damper and smoothes out contact patch load variations on the tyres . Smith also suggests using the inerter to reduce machine vibration . 
 The difficulty with mass in mechanical analogies is not limited to the mobility analogy . A corresponding problem also occurs in the impedance analogy , but in that case it is ungrounded inductors , rather than capacitors , that cannot be represented with the standard elements . 
 = = = Resonator = = = 
 A mechanical resonator consists of both a mass element and a compliance element . Mechanical resonators are analogous to electrical LC circuits consisting of inductance and capacitance . Real mechanical components unavoidably have both mass and compliance so it is a practical proposition to make resonators as a single component . In fact , it is more difficult to make a pure mass or pure compliance as a single component . A spring can be made with a certain compliance and mass minimised , or a mass can be made with compliance minimised , but neither can be eliminated altogether . Mechanical resonators are a key component of mechanical filters . 
 = = = Generators = = = 
 <unk> exist for the active electrical elements of the voltage source and the current source ( generators ) . The mechanical analogue in the mobility analogy of the constant current generator is the constant force generator . The mechanical analogue of the constant voltage generator is the constant velocity generator . 
 An example of a constant force generator is the constant @-@ force spring . An example of a practical constant velocity generator is a lightly loaded powerful machine , such as a motor , driving a belt . This is analogous to a real voltage source , such as a battery , which remains near constant @-@ voltage with load provided that the load resistance is much higher than the battery internal resistance . 
 = = = Transducers = = = 
 Electromechanical systems require transducers to convert between the electrical and mechanical domains . They are analogous to two @-@ port networks and like those can be described by a pair of simultaneous equations and four arbitrary parameters . There are numerous possible representations , but the form most applicable to the mobility analogy has the arbitrary parameters in units of admittance . In matrix form ( with the electrical side taken as port 1 ) this representation is , 
 <formula> 
 The element <formula> is the short circuit mechanical admittance , that is , the admittance presented by the mechanical side of the transducer when zero voltage ( short circuit ) is applied to the electrical side . The element <formula> , conversely , is the unloaded electrical admittance , that is , the admittance presented to the electrical side when the mechanical side is not driving a load ( zero force ) . The remaining two elements , <formula> and <formula> , describe the transducer forward and reverse transfer functions respectively . They are both analogous to transfer admittances and are hybrid ratios of an electrical and mechanical quantity . 
 = = = Transformers = = = 
 The mechanical analogy of a transformer is a simple machine such as a pulley or a lever . The force applied to the load can be greater or less than the input force depending on whether the mechanical advantage of the machine is greater or less than unity respectively . Mechanical advantage is analogous to the inverse of transformer turns ratio in the mobility analogy . A mechanical advantage less than unity is analogous to a step @-@ up transformer and greater than unity is analogous to a step @-@ down transformer .

 The figure shows a mechanical arrangement of a platform of mass M that is suspended above the substrate by a spring of stiffness S and a damper of resistance Rm . The mobility analogy equivalent circuit is shown to the right of this arrangement and consists of a parallel resonant circuit . This system has a resonant frequency , and may have a natural frequency of oscillation if not too heavily damped . 
 = = Advantages and disadvantages = = 
 The principal advantage of the mobility analogy over its alternative , the impedance analogy , is that it preserves the topology of the mechanical system . Elements that are in series in the mechanical system are in series in the electrical equivalent circuit and elements in parallel in the mechanical system remain in parallel in the electrical equivalent . 
 The principal disadvantage of the mobility analogy is that it does not maintain the analogy between electrical and mechanical impedance . Mechanical impedance is represented as an electrical admittance and a mechanical resistance is represented as an electrical conductance in the electrical equivalent circuit . Force is not analogous to voltage ( generator voltages are often called electromotive force ) , but rather , it is analogous to current . 
 = = History = = 
 Historically , the impedance analogy was in use long before the mobility analogy . Mechanical admittance and the associated mobility analogy were introduced by F. A. Firestone in 1932 to overcome the issue of preserving topologies . W. <unk> independently had the same idea in Germany . H. M. Trent developed a treatment for analogies in general from a mathematical graph theory perspective and introduced a new analogy of his own . 
 = USS Concord ( PG @-@ 3 ) = 
 USS Concord ( Gunboat No. 3 / PG @-@ 3 ) was a member of the Yorktown class of steel @-@ hulled , twin @-@ screw gunboats in the United States Navy in the late 19th and early 20th centuries . She was the second U.S. Navy ship named in honor of the town of Concord , Massachusetts , site of the Battle of Concord in the American Revolutionary War . 
 The contract to build Concord was awarded to N. F. Palmer & Co. of Philadelphia in the 1888 fiscal year . Her hull was subcontracted to the Delaware River Iron Shipbuilding & Engine Works which laid down her keel in May 1888 . Concord was launched in March 1890 . She was just over 244 feet ( 74 m ) long and 36 feet ( 11 m ) abeam and displaced 1 @,@ 710 long tons ( 1 @,@ 740 t ) . She was equipped with two steam engines which were supplemented with three schooner @-@ rigged masts . The ship 's main battery consisted of six 6 @-@ inch ( 15 @.@ 2 cm ) guns and was augmented by an assortment of smaller caliber guns . 
 After her 1891 commissioning , Concord spent the next few years sailing along the East Coast , in the West Indies , and in the Gulf of Mexico . Concord cruised on the Asiatic Station — interrupted only by a short stint on the Alaskan sealing patrol — from 1893 until May 1896 , when she began a year out of commission at San Francisco . In January 1898 , Concord returned to the Asiatic Station , and joined Admiral George Dewey 's fleet for 1 May 1898 Battle of Manila Bay , a decisive American victory over the Spanish Fleet in the Spanish – American War . After the battle , Concord supported United States Army operations in the Philippines in the Philippine – American War . For the rest of her active career , Concord patrolled off the Mexican and Alaskan coasts and served on the Yangtze Patrol . She was decommissioned in 1909 and served as a barracks ship until 1914 , and as a quarantine ship at Astoria , Oregon for the Public Health Service until 1929 , at which time she was returned to the Navy and sold . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 The Yorktown class gunboats — unofficially considered third @-@ class cruisers — were the product of a United States Navy design attempt to produce compact ships with good sea @-@ keeping abilities and , yet , able to carry a heavy battery . Concord was authorized in the 1888 fiscal year , and the contract for her construction was awarded to N. F. Palmer & Co. of Chester , Pennsylvania . The hull for Concord was sublet by Palmer to the Delaware River Iron Shipbuilding & Engine Works and built to the Navy 's Bureau of Construction and Repair design . The mechanical design was patterned after the layout for older sister ship Yorktown developed by William Cramp & Sons . 
 Concord 's keel was laid down in May 1888 , and the ship was launched on 8 March 1890 , sponsored by Minnie Darlington Coates , the daughter of Major Joseph R. T. Coates , the mayor of Chester . Among those in attendance at the launch ceremony was sculptor Daniel Chester French .

 As built , Concord was 244 feet 5 inches ( 74 @.@ 50 m ) in length and 36 feet ( 11 m ) abeam . Her steel hull had an average draft of 14 feet ( 4 m ) , which was expected to give her the ability to escape from larger ships into shallow water . At the waterline was a turtleback deck of ⅜ -inch ( 9 @.@ 5 mm ) steel that formed a watertight seal over the lower spaces . The deck had a crown at the level of the waterline and curved downwards to 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) below the waterline at the sides of the ship . Below this armored deck were twelve compartments separated by watertight bulkheads ; the spaces above were equipped with watertight doors intended to be closed during battle . 
 Above the armored deck , Concord had forecastle and poop decks with an open gun deck that spanned the length of the ship between them . The conning tower was located forward on the forecastle deck and was oval @-@ shaped to deflect shot . It was outfitted with a steam @-@ powered steering wheel , a telegraph , and speaking tubes ; it was protected by 2 inches ( 51 mm ) of steel armor plate . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 Concord was powered by two triple @-@ expansion steam engines which each drove one of the pair of 10 @.@ 5 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 2 m ) , three @-@ bladed screw propellers . The cylinders of each engine were 22 , 31 , and 51 inches ( 56 , 79 , and 130 cm ) in diameter and had a 30 @-@ inch ( 76 cm ) stroke . Each engine was rated at 3 @,@ 400 indicated horsepower ( 2 @,@ 500 kW ) and together were designed to move the ship at 16 knots ( 30 km / h ) , though the ship exceeded that in her trials . 
 The engines , situated in separate watertight compartments , were each fed by a pair of coal @-@ fired boilers . Each boiler was horizontally mounted and was 9 feet 6 inches ( 2 @.@ 90 m ) in diameter and 17 feet 6 inches ( 5 @.@ 33 m ) in length with a total grate area of 220 square inches ( 1 @,@ 400 cm2 ) . Concord 's coal bunkers could carry up to 400 long tons ( 410 t ) of the fuel , and were shielded from " shot and shell " . At a near top @-@ speed of 16 knots , the ship could cover 2 @,@ 800 nautical miles ( 5 @,@ 200 km ) in 6 ½ days ; at the more economical speed of 8 knots ( 15 km / h ) she could cruise 12 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 22 @,@ 000 km ) over 62 days . 
 To supplement her steam power plant , Concord was built with three masts that were schooner @-@ rigged . She had a total sail area of 6 @,@ 300 square feet ( 590 m2 ) . The steam and sail combination was expected to allow Concord to remain at sea for months at a time during wartime . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 Concord 's main battery consisted of six 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) / 30 caliber Mark 3 guns , with each gun weighing in excess of 11 @,@ 000 pounds ( 5 @,@ 000 kg ) . Two were mounted on the forecastle deck , two on the poop deck , and the other pair amidships on the gun deck . The two guns on the gun deck were mounted 10 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) above the waterline , while the other four were 18 feet ( 5 @.@ 5 m ) above . The guns fired 105 @-@ pound ( 48 kg ) armor @-@ piercing projectiles with a propellant charge weighing 18 @.@ 8 pounds ( 8 @.@ 5 kg ) at 1 @,@ 950 feet per second ( 590 m / s ) . At an elevation of 30 @.@ 2 ° , the guns had a range of 18 @,@ 000 yards ( 16 @,@ 000 m ) . Each gun was shielded with steel plating 3 inches ( 76 mm ) thick . 
 Concord 's secondary battery consisted of two 6 @-@ pounder ( 57 mm ( 2 @.@ 24 in ) ) guns , two 3 @-@ pounder ( 47 mm ( 1 @.@ 85 in ) ) guns , and two 1 @-@ pounder ( 37 mm ( 1 @.@ 46 in ) ) guns . All were based on designs of the French arms company Hotchkiss . According to a 1902 Bureau of Ordnance publication , an armor @-@ piercing round fired from a 6 @-@ pounder gun could penetrate 2 inches ( 51 mm ) of armor at a distance of 1 @,@ 000 yards ( 910 m ) .

 USS Concord ( PG @-@ 3 ) was commissioned on 14 February 1891 under the command of Commander O. A. <unk> . Concord operated on the coast of New England , and sailed from New York City on 17 November 1891 on a cruise to the West Indies and South America with her squadron , then arrived at New Orleans , Louisiana , on 27 April 1892 and cruised up the Mississippi River as far as Cairo , Illinois , visiting various ports en route . 
 Returning to New York on 13 June 1892 , Concord made another cruise to the West Indies late that year , and arrived back at Norfolk , Virginia , on 5 December . She participated in International Naval Review held at Norfolk and New York in March and April 1893 , and in June sailed from Norfolk for the Far East , calling at the Azores , Gibraltar , Malta , Port Said , Bangkok , and Saigon before arriving at Hong Kong on 30 October . She cruised on the Asiatic Station until 29 May 1894 when she arrived at Unalaska . She cruised on sealing patrol in the North Pacific to carry out the provisions of the treaty between the United States and United Kingdom , which empowered Concord to seize any vessel violating the laws protecting valuable fur seals . She gathered hydrographic information to correct Bering Sea charts and conduct scientific observations of the fur seals . 
 Concord returned to the Asiatic Station in September 1894 and continued to serve in the Far East until returning to San Francisco on 3 May 1896 . She was placed out of commission for repairs between 27 May 1896 and 22 May 1897 . After a cruise to Alaskan waters 1 July – 29 November , she sailed from Mare Island 8 January 1898 for the Asiatic Station . With the declaration of war between Spain and the United States in April , Concord joined Admiral George Dewey 's squadron at <unk> Bay near Hong Kong on the 24th and sailed for the Philippines . On 1 May , Concord participated in the Battle of Manila Bay that resulted in American control of the Philippines . 
 Concord resumed her patrol on station in August 1898 , but returned to the Philippines on 19 December to assist in putting down the insurrection . Her duty consisted of patrolling the coast to restrict insurgent movements and shipping ; bombarding various strongholds ; and aiding United States Army operations . Except for a voyage to Guam in March 1900 to deliver stores , and a brief voyage to Hong Kong for repairs , Concord remained in Philippine waters until June 1901 , when she sailed by way of Alaskan waters to San Francisco , arriving 28 September 1901 . She cruised with the Fleet in Mexican waters , then went out of commission on 26 February 1902 at Mare Island . 
 Recommissioned on 15 June 1903 Concord operated along the North American coast from Alaska to Panama and to Hawaii and Alaska until decommissioned at Bremerton , Washington , on 25 August 1904 . Concord was commissioned again on 16 September 1905 and sailed from Bremerton on 24 December 1905 for operations in the Philippines . Remaining there until March 1906 , Concord sailed to China . Until 1908 she remained in the Far East serving at times on the Yangtze Patrol and as station ship at Shanghai and Canton . 
 Concord served as station ship at Guam from 2 January to 10 September 1909 , then sailed to Puget Sound Navy Yard where she arrived on 11 October . She was decommissioned for the final time on 4 November 1909 , and assigned as barracks ship for the Washington Naval Militia at Seattle . She was transferred to the Public Health Service of the Treasury Department on 15 June 1914 and served as a stationary quarantine barge at Astoria , Oregon . Returned to naval custody on 19 March 1929 , she was sold on 28 June 1929 . 
 In August 1915 two of the Concord 's six @-@ inch guns were placed in the War Garden of Woodland Park , Seattle , WA . The Seattle Times of 15 August stated : " Two six @-@ inch guns from the United States cruiser Concord which saw active service at the battle of Manila , yesterday afternoon were brought to Seattle from Bremerton under the direction of the United Spanish War Veterans , to be mounted in Woodland Park in the near future . W. S. F. Quick , chairman of the board of managers of the United Spanish War Veterans Club of Seattle , yesterday signed a receipt for government property valued at $ 18 @,@ 000 , which gives the local veterans practical possession of the pieces from now on . The two guns when mounted will be known as Battery Dewey . " These guns are today near the Woodland Park Zoo in the Phinney Ridge neighborhood of Seattle . 
 = Alan Shearer = 
 Alan Shearer , CBE , DL ( / <unk> / ; born 13 August 1970 ) is a retired English footballer . He played as a striker in the top level of English league football for Southampton , Blackburn Rovers , Newcastle United and for the England national team . He is Newcastle 's and the Premier League 's record goalscorer . He was named Football Writers ' Association Player of the Year in 1994 and won the PFA Player of the Year award in 1995 . In 1996 , he was third in the FIFA World Player of the Year awards . 
 Shearer scored 283 league goals in his career , including a record 260 in the Premier League ( of which 58 were penalties ) with a record 11 Premier League hat @-@ tricks , and a total of 422 in all competitions including international at all levels . Until his retirement from international football 2000 he appeared 63 times for his country and scored 30 goals . Shearer had a goals to game ratio of 0 @.@ 667 throughout his career . 
 Since retiring as a player in 2006 , Shearer has worked as a television pundit for the BBC . In 2009 , he briefly left his BBC role to become Newcastle United 's manager in the last eight games of their 2008 – 09 season , in an unsuccessful attempt to save them from relegation . Shearer is a Commander of the Order of the British Empire ( CBE ) , a Deputy Lieutenant of Northumberland , a Freeman of Newcastle upon Tyne and an honorary Doctor of Civil Law of Northumbria and Newcastle Universities . 
 = = Early years = = 
 Shearer was born in Gosforth , Newcastle in 1970 to working @-@ class parents Alan and Anne Shearer . His father , a sheet @-@ metal worker , encouraged a keen Shearer to play football in his youth , and the young player continued with the sport as he progressed through school . He was educated at Gosforth Central Middle School and Gosforth High School . Growing up playing on the streets of his hometown , he originally played in midfield because " it meant [ he ] could get more involved in the games . " Shearer captained his school team and helped a Newcastle City Schools team win a seven @-@ a @-@ side tournament at St James ' Park , before joining the amateur Wallsend Boys Club as a teenager . It was while playing for the Wallsend club that he was spotted by Southampton 's scout , Jack Hixon , which resulted in Shearer spending his summers training with the club 's youth team , a time he would later refer to as " the making of me " . Shearer had successful trials for First Division clubs West Bromwich Albion , Manchester City and Newcastle United , before being offered a youth contract with Southampton in April 1986 . 
 = = Club career = = 
 = = = Southampton ( 1986 – 1992 ) = = = 
 Shearer was promoted to the first team after spending two years with the youth squad . He made his professional debut for Southampton on 26 March 1988 , coming on as a substitute in a First Division fixture at Chelsea , before prompting national headlines in his full debut at The Dell two weeks later . He scored a hat @-@ trick , helping the team to a 4 – 2 victory against Arsenal , thus becoming the youngest player – at 17 years , 240 days – to score a hat @-@ trick in the top division , breaking Jimmy Greaves ' 30 @-@ year – old record . Shearer ended the 1987 – 88 season with three goals in five games , and was rewarded with his first professional contract . 
 Despite this auspicious start to his career , Shearer was only eased into the first team gradually and made just ten goalless appearances for the club the following season . Throughout his career Shearer was recognised for his strength , which , during his time at Southampton , enabled him to retain the ball and provide opportunities for team mates . Playing as a lone striker between wide men , Rod Wallace and Matt Le Tissier , Shearer scored three goals in 26 appearances in the 1989 – 90 season , and in the next , four goals in 36 games . His performances in the centre of the Saints attack were soon recognised by the fans , who voted him their Player of the Year for 1991 . 
 In the middle of 1991 , Shearer was a member of the England national under @-@ 21 football squad in the Toulon Tournament in Toulon , France . Shearer was the star of the tournament where he scored seven goals in four games . It was during the 1991 – 92 season that Shearer rose to national prominence . 13 goals in 41 appearances for the Saints led to an England call @-@ up ; he scored on his debut , and was strongly linked in the press with a summer move to Manchester United . A possible move for Shearer was being mentioned in the media during late autumn of 1991 , but he rejected talk of a transfer ( Leeds United were also linked to Shearer ) and vowed to see out the season with Southampton , resisting the temptation of a possible transfer to the two clubs who headed the title race for most of the season . Speculation of a transfer to Liverpool , who finished the season as FA Cup winners , also came to nothing . 
 During the middle of 1992 , Southampton 's manager , Ian Branfoot , became " the most popular manager in English football " , as he took telephone calls from clubs " trying to bargain with players they don 't want plus cash " . Although Branfoot accepted that a sale was inevitable , he claimed that " whatever happens , we are in the driving seat " . In July 1992 , Shearer was sold to Blackburn Rovers for a fee of £ 3 @.@ 6 million , with David Speedie reluctantly moving to The Dell as part of the deal . Despite Branfoot 's claim to be " in the driving seat " , Saints failed to include a " sell @-@ on clause " in the contract . Shearer , less than a month off his 22nd birthday , was the most expensive player in British football . In his four years in the Southampton first team , Shearer made a total of 158 appearances in all competitions , scoring 43 goals . 
 = = = Blackburn Rovers ( 1992 – 1996 ) = = = 
 Despite making just one goalless appearance as England failed to progress past the Euro 1992 group stages , Shearer was soon subject to an English transfer record @-@ breaking £ <unk> bid from Blackburn Rovers . Although there was also interest from Manchester United manager Alex Ferguson , Blackburn benefactor Jack Walker 's millions were enough to prise the striker from the Saints , and Shearer moved north to Ewood Park in the middle of 1992 . 
 His first season with Blackburn was mixed – he missed half of it through injury after snapping his right anterior cruciate ligament in a match against Leeds United in December 1992 , but scored a prolific 16 goals in the 21 games in which he did feature . Shearer also became a regular in the England team this season and scored his second international goal ; it came in a 4 – 0 1994 FIFA World Cup qualifier win over Turkey in November . The season ended sourly , however , as Shearer was forced to miss January through to May due to injury and England 's World Cup qualification chances were hit by a run of poor form . 
 Returning to fitness for the 1993 – 94 season , he scored 31 goals from 40 games as Blackburn finished runners @-@ up in the Premier League . His performances for the club led to him being named the Football Writers ' Association Footballer of the Year for that season . On the international scene , England had failed to qualify for the 1994 World Cup finals , but Shearer added three more goals to his international tally before embarking on his most successful domestic season as a player to date . 
 The arrival of Chris Sutton for the 1994 – 95 season established a strong attacking partnership at Blackburn . Shearer 's league @-@ record 34 goals , coupled with Sutton 's 15 , helped the Lancashire club take the Premier League title from arch rivals Manchester United on the final day of the season , and the duo gained the nickname " the SAS " ( Shearer And Sutton ) . After being asked by the press how he planned to celebrate winning the title , Shearer replied , by " <unk> the fence " . Shearer also had his first taste of European football in the UEFA Cup that season , and scored in the second leg as Blackburn went out in the first round , losing to Trelleborgs FF of Sweden . His efforts for the club led to Shearer being awarded the PFA Players ' Player of the Year for 1995 . 
 Although the club could not retain the title the following year , Shearer again ended the ( now 38 @-@ game ) season as Premier League top scorer , with 31 goals in 35 games , as Blackburn finished seventh in the league . The previous season 's first @-@ place finish also saw the club enter the Champions League . Shearer 's only goal in six full Champions League games was a penalty in a 4 – 1 victory against Rosenborg BK in the final fixture and Blackburn finished third in their group , failing to progress to the next stage . 
 He passed the 100 @-@ goal milestone for Blackburn in all competitions on 23 September 1995 , scoring a hat @-@ trick in their 5 – 1 home win over Coventry City in the Premier League . On 30 December , he scored his 100th Premier League goal for the club in a 2 – 1 home win over Tottenham Hotspur . His final tally for the club was 112 goals in the Premier League and 130 in all competitions . His final goals for the club came on 17 April 1996 , when he scored twice in a 3 – 2 home league win over Wimbledon . 
 Shearer 's international strike rate had also dried up , with no goals in the twelve matches leading up to Euro 96 . He missed the final three games of the season for his club due to injury , but recovered in time to play in England 's UEFA European Championship campaign . 
 = = = Newcastle United ( 1996 – 2006 ) = = = 
 After Euro 96 , Manchester United again sought to sign Shearer , and attempted to enter the battle for his signature . However Manchester United chairman Martin Edwards stated that Blackburn Rovers refused to let Shearer go to Old Trafford . Ultimately Shearer joined his boyhood club and Manchester United 's title rivals Newcastle United . 
 On 30 July 1996 , for a world transfer record @-@ breaking £ 15 million ( equivalent to £ 25 @.@ 39 million today ) Shearer joined his hometown club and league runners @-@ up Newcastle United , managed by his hero Keegan . Shearer made his league debut away at Everton , on 17 August 1996 , and maintained his form during the rest of the season , finishing as Premier League top @-@ scorer for the third consecutive season with 25 goals in 31 Premier League games , as well as winning another PFA Player of the Year accolade , despite a groin injury forcing him to miss seven matches . Perhaps his best performance of the season came on 2 February 1997 when Newcastle went into the final 15 minutes of the game 3 – 1 down at home to Leicester City in the league , only for Shearer to win them the game 4 – 3 by scoring a late hat @-@ trick . 
 However , the league title still eluded the club , who finished second in the league for a consecutive year , with Keegan resigning mid @-@ way through the season . 
 Another injury problem ; this time an ankle ligament injury sustained in a pre @-@ season match at Goodison Park , restricted Shearer to just two goals in 17 games in the 1997 – 98 season . His injury was reflected in the club 's form , and Newcastle finished just 13th in the Premier League . However , United ( now managed by Shearer 's old boss at Blackburn , Kenny Dalglish ) had a good run in the FA Cup ; Shearer scored the winning goal in a semi @-@ final victory over Sheffield United as the team reached the final . The team were unable to get on the scoresheet at Wembley , and lost the game 2 – 0 to Arsenal . 
 An incident during a game against Leicester City in the league saw Shearer charged with misconduct by the FA , with media sources claiming that video footage showed him intentionally kicking Neil Lennon in the head following a challenge . The referee of the game took no action against Shearer , and he was then cleared of all charges by the FA , with Lennon giving evidence in the player 's defence . Former Football Association chief Graham Kelly , who brought the charges against the player , later claimed in his autobiography that Shearer had threatened to withdraw himself from the 1998 World Cup squad if the charges were upheld ; a claim strenuously denied by Shearer . 
 An almost injury @-@ free season helped Shearer improve on his previous year 's tally in 1998 – 99 , the striker converting 14 goals in 30 league games and replacing Rob Lee as Newcastle captain , but Newcastle finished 13th again , with Ruud Gullit having replaced Kenny Dalglish just after the season got underway . He also helped Newcastle to a second consecutive FA Cup final and qualification for the following season 's UEFA Cup , scoring twice in the semi @-@ final against Tottenham Hotspur , but they once again lost ; this time 2 – 0 to treble @-@ chasing Manchester United . 
 On the opening day of the 1999 – 2000 season , Shearer received the first red card of his career in his 100th appearance for Newcastle . After dropping Shearer to the bench in a Tyne @-@ Wear derby loss against Sunderland , the unpopular Gullit resigned to be replaced by the 66 @-@ year @-@ old Bobby Robson . Despite Gullit giving Shearer the captain 's armband , reports of a rift between club captain and manager were rife , Gullit 's decision to drop Shearer proved deeply unpopular with fans and his departure capped a dismal start to the season . The animosity between Shearer and Gullit was later confirmed by the latter , who reported telling the striker that he was " ... the most overrated player I have ever seen . " Ironically , Robson had tried to sign Shearer for Barcelona in 1997 , making a bid of £ <unk> which would have seen Shearer break the world 's transfer fee record for the second time in 12 months . However , then Newcastle manager Kenny Dalglish rejected the offer . 
 In Robson 's first match in charge , Shearer scored five goals in an 8 – 0 defeat of Sheffield Wednesday . With Robson in charge , the team moved away from the relegation zone , finishing in mid @-@ table and reached the FA Cup semi @-@ finals , but a third consecutive final was beyond them as they were beaten by Chelsea . Shearer missed only one league game and notched up 23 goals . 
 Shearer suffered an injury @-@ hit and frustrating season in 2000 – 01 , having retired from international football after the UEFA Euro 2000 tournament to focus on club football . He managed only five goals in 19 games in the league . 2001 – 02 was much better though ; Shearer bagged 23 goals in 37 league games as Newcastle finished fourth — their highest standing since 1997 — meaning they would qualify for the following season 's Champions League competition . One of the most memorable incidents of the season saw Roy Keane sent off after a confrontation with Shearer during Newcastle 's 4 – 3 win over the Red Devils in September 2001 . Shearer also saw red for the second time in his career this season , after allegedly elbowing an opposition player in a match against Charlton Athletic . The card was subsequently rescinded by referee Andy D 'Urso after reviewing video replays after the game . 
 The 2002 – 03 season saw Shearer and Newcastle make their return to the UEFA Champions League . Newcastle lost their first three matches in the opening group stage , but Shearer 's goal against Dynamo Kyiv , coupled with further wins against Juventus and Feyenoord saw the club progress to the second group stage . Shearer 's Champions League hat @-@ trick against Bayer Leverkusen and a brace against Internazionale in the second group stage helped him reach a total of seven Champions League goals , along with his 17 in 35 games in the league , and a total of 25 for the season as the team again improved to finish in third place in the Premier League . 
 After this , Newcastle would have one more chance to progress in the Champions League in early 2003 , but Shearer was one of those who failed to score as the team were eliminated in a penalty shootout by Partizan Belgrade in the third qualifying round . United progressed well in that season 's UEFA Cup and Shearer 's six goals helped the club reach the semi @-@ finals , where they were beaten by eventual runners up Olympique de Marseille . Domestically he also had a good season , with 22 goals in 37 appearances , however could not prevent the club dropping out of the Champions League places to finish in fifth , qualifying once again for the UEFA Cup . 
 Announcing that this would be his final season before retirement , Shearer 's form in 2004 – 05 was patchy ; alongside new signing Patrick Kluivert , he scored only seven goals in his 28 games as the club finished the season in 14th place . The club fared better in the cup competitions , however , eventually losing out to Sporting CP in the UEFA Cup quarter @-@ finals and Manchester United in the FA Cup semi @-@ finals . Shearer scored a hat @-@ trick in the first round win against Hapoel Bnei Sakhnin , and ended the season with a haul of 11 European goals , in addition to his one goal in domestic cups . 
 The middle of 2005 saw Shearer reverse his decision to retire after persuasion from manager Graeme Souness . He decided to continue playing in a player @-@ coach capacity until the end of the following season. and he returned for one more season in 2005 – 06 . This last season saw him break Jackie Milburn 's 49 @-@ year @-@ old record of 200 goals for Newcastle United ( not including his 38 World War II Wartime League goals ) when he netted his 201st strike in a home Premier League fixture against Portsmouth on 4 February 2006 , becoming the club 's highest @-@ ever league and cup competition goalscorer with 206 goals altogether . On 17 April 2006 , with three games remaining in his final season as a player , Shearer suffered a tear to the medial collateral ligament in his left knee after a collision during the 4 – 1 win at Sunderland in which he scored his 206th goal in what was his 395th appearance for the club . The injury caused him to miss those final three games , effectively bringing forward his retirement . Shearer finished his final season with 10 goals in 32 league games . 
 = = = Tribute and testimonial = = = 
 In tribute to Shearer 's contribution to Newcastle United over more than ten years , the club erected a large banner of Shearer on the outside of the cantilever superstructure of the Gallowgate End of St James ' Park . The banner measured 25 metres ( 82 ft ) high by 32 metres ( 105 ft ) wide , covering almost half of the Gallowgate End , aptly placed above the club bar , <unk> bar , opened in his honour in 2005 . The banner depicted Shearer as the " Gallowgate Giant " , with one arm aloft in his signature goal celebration , with the message " Thanks for 10 great years " , and was featured in the media coverage reflecting on his career at the club , with the banner being displayed from 19 April 2006 until 11 May 2006 , the day of his testimonial match . The banner could be seen across the city and as far away as Gateshead across the River Tyne , standing taller than the iconic local landmark , the Angel of the North . 
 Shearer was awarded a testimonial match by the club , against Scottish @-@ side Celtic . All proceeds of the match went to charitable causes . Because of the injury he sustained three games earlier at Sunderland , Shearer was unable to play in the whole match ; however he kicked @-@ off the game and came off the bench to score a penalty , winning the game 3 – 2 . The match was a sell @-@ out , and saw Shearer perform a lap of honour at the end with his family , with his young son notably covering his ears due to the volume of noise produced by the crowd in tribute . 
 = = International career = = 
 Shearer 's international career began in 1990 when he was handed a callup to the England under @-@ 21 squad under Dave Sexton . During his time with the squad , he scored 13 times in 11 games ; a record return which is still unbeaten . The striker 's goals at this level , coupled with his club form , meant he was soon promoted to the senior squad by coach Graham Taylor . Marking his debut in the 2 – 0 win against France in February 1992 with a goal , he made his only appearance for the England B team a month later . Due to replace Gary Lineker , who retired from international action after UEFA Euro 1992 , in the England attack , Shearer played only intermittently in the qualifying campaign for the 1994 FIFA World Cup due to injury and the team failed to reach the competition finals . 
 UEFA Euro 1996 was a more positive experience for both Shearer and England . With England not required to qualify as hosts , Shearer had not scored in 12 games in the 21 months prior , and even his overall goalscoring record for England did not look too impressive so far ; five goals in 23 games . 
 However , he found the net in the 22nd minute of the first game , against Switzerland . Scoring once in the following game against Scotland and twice in a 4 – 1 win over the Netherlands , Shearer helped England to progress to the next stage in front of their own fans in Wembley . 
 In the quarter @-@ finals , England were outplayed by Spain but got through to a penalty shootout after a goalless draw . Shearer scored the first England penalty , while the Spaniards failed to score from two of theirs , sending England into the semi @-@ final against Germany . Shearer headed England into the lead after three minutes , but the Germans quickly equalised and the match went to penalties again . This time , Germany won from the spot ; although Shearer scored , his team @-@ mate Gareth Southgate missed his kick and England were eliminated . Shearer 's five goals made him the competition 's top scorer , and together with team mates David Seaman and Steve McManaman , was listed in the official UEFA team of the tournament . 
 The new England manager Glenn Hoddle appointed Shearer captain for the 1998 FIFA World Cup qualifier against Moldova on 1 September 1996 , and the player held onto the captaincy after scoring once in that match and twice in the following game against Poland . He scored a total of five goals in England 's successful qualification campaign for the World Cup ; adding strikes against Georgia and away to Poland to his tally . Shearer was sidelined for much of the 1997 – 98 season , but recovered to play in the World Cup finals . With Michael Owen replacing Teddy Sheringham as Shearer 's strike partner , Shearer 's return saw him score England 's first goal of the tournament , in a 2 – 0 win over Tunisia , his only goal in the three group matches . England faced long @-@ time rivals Argentina in the second round . Shearer scored a first @-@ half equaliser from the penalty @-@ spot before David Beckham was sent off early in the second half . In the final minutes of the game Sol Campbell headed in what could have been the winning goal only for the referee to disallow it due to Shearer having elbowed goalkeeper Carlos Roa . The scores tied 2 – 2 , the game went to penalties . Shearer scored again , but England were eliminated after David Batty 's shot was saved by the Argentina goalkeeper . This defeat ended England 's participation in what was to be Shearer 's only World Cup tournament . 
 In September 1999 , Shearer scored his only England hat @-@ trick in a UEFA Euro 2000 qualifier against Luxembourg . This helped England reach a play @-@ off against Scotland ; England won the game over two legs and in doing so qualified for the European Championships . By now , Shearer was approaching his 30th birthday , and he announced that he intended to retire from international football after the Euro 2000 tournament . 
 Shearer did not score in England 's opening 3 – 2 defeat against Portugal , but did so as England defeated Germany 1 – 0 in Charleroi , ensuring that England beat their European neighbours for the first time since the 1966 World Cup Final . To remain in the tournament , England only required a draw against Romania in the final group match , and Shearer scored a penalty as England went in at half @-@ time 2 – 1 up , but Romania ultimately won 3 – 2 . England 's tournament was over , and so was Shearer 's international career . From his 63 caps , he captained the team 34 times and scored thirty goals ; joint @-@ fifth in the England all @-@ time goalscorers list with Nat Lofthouse and Tom Finney . Shearer remained in international retirement despite speculation of a return during the 2002 World Cup and 2004 European Championship campaigns , and further declined an offer to be assistant manager to Steve McClaren after the 2006 World Cup – a position ultimately filled by Terry Venables . 
 = = Style of play = = 
 As a player , Shearer was often styled as a classic English centre @-@ forward , owing to his strength , physical stature , heading ability and strong shot , which enabled him to be highly prolific goalscorer . Of his 206 Newcastle goals , 49 were scored with his head . Earlier in his career , especially at Southampton , Shearer played a more creative role : providing chances for fellow strikers , and making runs into space , owing to his early development as a midfielder . Later on in his career , Shearer played a more forward role ; his age meant that he lost much of the pace which served him on the south coast . Able to hold the ball up well , he also functioned as a target man , providing balls for other players . Although his strength allowed him to hold on to the ball , his playing style sometimes brought him criticism – most commonly that his play was too physical , and that he used his elbows too aggressively . It was this which contributed to both of his sendings off , although one was later rescinded on appeal . As well as the two red cards , Shearer received 59 yellow cards during his career . 
 Shearer was noted as a proficient penalty taker for both club and country , and he scored 45 times from the spot for Newcastle , where he was the first @-@ choice taker . He also scored five goals from free @-@ kicks for the north @-@ east club .

 On his retirement as a player Shearer responded to speculation of an immediate move into coaching that he would take some personal time off to " enjoy life " for the next couple of years . He was also quoted as saying that he would eventually like to move into management , " when the time was right " however as of March 2009 he was yet to start the UEFA Pro Licence course , which is required to be permitted to manage a team in the Premier League and European competition . 
 Reflecting his desire for personal time off to " enjoy life " , in July 2006 he turned down a coaching role with England , citing his BBC commitments and desire to be away from the pressure of a job within football . Despite this , Shearer was often linked in the media with managerial or coaching positions at his three former clubs . 
 Shearer took a brief role in the dugout for his final three games under Glenn Roeder . Shearer had rejected offers of coaching or assistant roles at Newcastle under both the returning Kevin Keegan in February 2008 and Joe Kinnear in November 2008 . Shearer had previously had talks about , but never been offered , a full @-@ time manager 's role at Newcastle until his appointment on 1 April 2009 . 
 = = = Newcastle United = = = 
 In a surprise move , late on 1 April 2009 , it was announced that Shearer would become the manager of his former club Newcastle United for the remaining eight games of the season , taking over from head coach Chris Hughton who was in temporary charge while the permanent manager Joe Kinnear recovered from heart surgery , having taken ill on 7 February . Shearer stated " It 's a club I love and I don 't want them to go down . I 'll do everything I can to stop that . " 
 Shearer was unveiled at a press conference the following day by club managing director Derek Llambias . In explaining his acceptance of a managerial role at Newcastle at this time , Shearer stated that he would not have done this for any other club in this position , including his two other previous Premier League clubs . Amid persistent questioning regarding the permanency of the appointment , Llambias announced that Shearer was to be manager for the remaining eight games , and after his recovery , Joe Kinnear would return as manager after the end of the season . Shearer confirmed that the BBC had agreed to giving him an 8 @-@ week sabbatical from his Match of the Day role . Llambias also confirmed Dennis Wise had left his executive role at the club and the club had no plans to appoint a replacement , with Shearer stating that " the people that have moved , were moving on anyways , that had nothing to do with me " . Wise 's presence had previously been speculated as being a blockage to any possible appointment of a manager . Shearer accepted the surprise offer on the Monday on the condition that he could bring in Iain Dowie as his assistant . Shearer also brought in Paul Ferris to oversee club medical , physio and dietary matters . Ferris had previously worked with Shearer in his playing days , and had been at the club for 13 years prior to an earlier departure under then manager Glenn Roeder . 
 His first match in charge ended in a 2 – 0 defeat against Chelsea at St. James ' Park . On 11 April , Newcastle earned their first point under Shearer with a 1 – 1 draw with Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium with Andy Carroll scoring a late equalising goal . After a defeat to Tottenham Hotspur and a draw against Portsmouth , his first win for Newcastle came in a 3 – 1 victory over Middlesbrough that lifted Newcastle from the relegation zone . 
 On the eve of the final day of the season on 24 May , where all fixtures are played simultaneously , Newcastle faced the prospect of being relegated to the Championship , along with Hull City , Middlesbrough and Sunderland , which would end their 16 @-@ year unbroken spell in the Premier League . After losing 1 – 0 at Aston Villa with Damien Duff scoring an own goal , Newcastle were relegated with local rivals Middlesbrough , joining West Bromwich Albion whose relegation had been confirmed in previous weeks , while Sunderland and Hull City survived . Shearer 's eight games yielded only five points out of a possible twenty @-@ four . 
 Shearer did not get the manager 's job on permanent basis . Chris Hughton stepped up from the coaching staff to take charge of the quest to get Newcastle back into the Premier League , which was achieved at the first attempt as Newcastle finished top of the Championship in 2009 – 10 . 
 Cardiff City 
 On 14 June 2011 , BBC Sport Wales reported the Shearer had held talks with Championship club Cardiff City over the vacant manager job . Shearer commented the next day that , " unfortunately , those talks were unsuccessful on this occasion . "

 Shearer is married to <unk> , whom he met whilst a Southampton player . The couple lived locally with her parents during Shearer 's second year at the south coast club , and were married on 8 June 1991 at St. James ' Church in the city . In contrast to the portrayal of some <unk> ( wives and girlfriends ) of later players by the media , <unk> is described by Shearer as a quiet and reserved person , not comfortable in the spotlight her husband 's fame sometimes brought . The couple have three children . Shearer cited not wanting to uproot his family as a key reason for remaining in England during his career , having had the chance to move to Juventus or Barcelona when leaving Blackburn . Shearer 's family accompanied him onto the pitch following the striker 's testimonial in May 2006 as he performed a lap of honour at St. James ' Park .

Deputies must live within seven miles of the county boundaries , and retain their appointment until age 75 . The Duchess said of the appointment that " You could not find a more iconic person than Alan , not just for what he has done in football but for all the extra work he tirelessly does for charity and communities . I am delighted he has accepted the role of Deputy Lieutenant because he is a real role model . I have promised him he is not going to have to do too much , but even if it is just one occasion a year he is the perfect choice "

 Former Newcastle chairman Freddy Shepherd announced that , after Shearer finished the 2005 – 06 season as Newcastle 's caretaker assistant manager , he would become the club 's " Sporting Ambassador " for 2006 – 07 . However , in September 2008 it was reported that Shearer was removed from this largely honorary position by the club 's owner Mike Ashley despite protests from players such as Steven Taylor and Damien Duff , due to Shearer 's criticism of the way in which the club was being run in the wake of the departure of Kevin Keegan . These reports were denied by the club . 
 Shearer features in EA Sports ' FIFA video game series ; he was included in the FIFA 15 Ultimate Team Legends .

 Nidhogg is a side @-@ scrolling two @-@ player fighting video game by Mark " Messhof " Essen . Players duel with swords in a pixelated environment . The game was commissioned for the New York University Game Center 's annual multiplayer show , and was revised and demoed at private events over the next four years before its final release . It won Indiecade 2013 's Game Design award and the 2011 Independent Games Festival 's Nuovo award . It was released for Microsoft Windows on January 13 , 2014 , and later ported to OS X , PlayStation 4 , and PlayStation Vita . Critics praised the feel of the gameplay and its balance , but considered the single @-@ player mode to be unsatisfying . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Nidhogg is a fast @-@ paced two @-@ player dueling game where two players sword fight in a side @-@ scrolling environment . Players can run , jump , slide , throw their swords , and fistfight . The player @-@ character 's sword can be held at three different heights : low , medium , and high , and changing the sword 's position to hit the opponent 's sword will disarm the opponent . Players can also dive kick , wall jump , climb ledges , and crawl . The player continually pushes towards one side of the screen , such that they are permitted a few seconds to run towards their opponent 's side while their opponent respawns after dying . The player to reach the end of their opponent 's side first wins and is eaten by the mythological Norse serpent Níðhöggr . Nidhogg has four different levels and single @-@ player , local multiplayer , and online multiplayer two @-@ player modes . The game also has a tournament mode and game variants including " boomerang swords " . It can be played via a shared keyboard , and its art style has a pixelated aesthetic similar to games of the 1980s , with vivid colors and simple graphics . 
 = = Development = = 
 The game was made by indie developer Mark " Messhof " Essen over the course of four years . It was commissioned for the New York University Game Center 's first No Quarter annual multiplayer show . It was first exhibited in April 2010 , known as Raging Hadron , and was delayed as Messhof planned a formal release . It was later renamed Nidhogg , after the mythological Norse serpent Níðhöggr , who appears in @-@ game . Messhof worked as the game 's only programmer and his time was divided between development and his other freelance and personal projects , graduate school , and a job teaching at University of Southern California . The game languished until Kristy <unk> made Messhof into an indie studio , joining as a co @-@ founder and working in a business development role . She led the search for the game 's musician . Their list of desired styles always included Daedelus , who they were able to contact through a mutual friend who attended high school with the musician . Daedelus designed some of the procedural elements that trigger the music sequences . Messhof described their process as wanting to " enhance the action " while letting players control the game 's tension . He felt lucky to have Daedelus as his composer . Messhof also asked a former student to help him complete the game 's netcode , which he deemed to be " totally essential " for the game 's future as an eSport . He read about " programming and fighting game structure " over the course of development , which he credited as important towards the game 's progress . It was his first attempt at networked multiplayer . 
 The core concept did not change over the course of development , though the other content did . Messhof limited the game 's exposure during this time as he wanted the game to be respected in the fighting game genre and wanted to make sure it was ready first . Messhof himself , however , did not have much experience in this genre . He said that he " spent a lot of time " on the gameplay 's feel and designed it to play slowly , where players wait for their opponent to move first , similar to Bushido Blade . He also spent time adding <unk> and cartwheels while improving the melee attacks and spectator experience . Some moves , such as a Yoshi @-@ style " ground pound " and the Karate Kid crane kick , were attempted and removed . In testing , he would observe players and their strategies before attempting to write an artificial intelligence to use similar strategies . Messhof considers the single @-@ player to be training for the online multiplayer , and the online multiplayer training for live matches . He described his process as making " the most fun game " to play with his friends . 
 Gamasutra 's Mike Rose wrote that the game became " the equivalent of a video game fable " for its appearance at video game shows but lack of public release . It won several awards within a year of its first showing and appeared at " hyper @-@ local indie group " <unk> such as the Hand Eye Society of Toronto and <unk> <unk> . A playable demo of the game was displayed at the 2013 Evolution Championship Series , with upgrades from previous demos of the game . The next year , the game was selected for the July 2014 Evolution Championship Series fighting game tournament 's Indie Showcase . Messhof said that the game works best in live , public settings . Nidhogg was released on January 13 , 2014 , for Microsoft Windows via Steam . The release includes online competition and an eight @-@ person tournament mode . Ports were later released for OS X on May 19 , 2014 , and for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation Vita on October 14 , 2014 . The Fencer later went on to appear as a playable character in the indie fighting game <unk> .

 Nidhogg received " generally favorable " reviews , according to video game review score aggregator Metacritic . It won Indiecade 2013 's Game Design award and the 2011 Independent Games Festival 's Nuovo Award , where it was also nominated for Excellence in Design and the Seumas McNally Grand Prize . It was IGN 's January 2014 Game of the Month , and Rock , Paper , Shotgun awarded the game their first physical trophy . Reviewers praised the feel of the gameplay and its balance , and thought the single @-@ player mode to be unsatisfying . Some critics found technical issues with the online multiplayer code , while others only had issues finding other players . 
 Brandon Boyer of Venus Patrol marked the game as part of a " multiplayer renaissance " alongside TowerFall and Samurai Gunn . Polygon 's Russ Frushtick described the game as a tug @-@ of @-@ war closer to the National Football League than to Street Fighter . He commended the game 's originality . Kyle Hilliard of Game Informer did not think the pixelated graphics were sufficiently " distinct " from similar games . He praised the soundtrack but wanted more tracks . 
 Eurogamer 's Quintin Smith praised the game 's balance , writing that " every single fight is hold @-@ your @-@ breath tense " , that even the shortest fights " take on an air of majesty " , and that kills feel fair . He described the game as multiplayer " theatre " for the impact the game has on those watching and playing it . Rock , Paper , Shotgun 's Alec Meer described the game as a combination of " precision and reckless abandon " . IGN 's Keza MacDonald called it the " most exhilarating competitive game [ she had ] played in years " . Edge put the game alongside Street Fighter II , Super Smash Bros. , and GoldenEye 007 as games " written into history indelibly for their competitive multiplayer " . The game later inspired indie games such as TowerFall and Samurai Gunn . Sean Hollister of The Verge described Nidhogg as " perfect " .

" In Los Angeles he was a founder of the Los Angeles Medical Society . He was a strong proponent of the new University of Southern California , and became its second President and the founding Dean of its School of Medicine . The Los Angeles Public Library was one of his major interests . 
 His real estate interests in California flourished , and he was an early environmentalist as well as promoter of the new metropolis . He believed deeply in Los Angeles becoming a major city with a seaport . The city would use water from across local mountains , and would recreate Lake Cahuilla . 
 He was a founder of the Church of the Nazarene in Los Angeles , as well as a Methodist pastor . He published many books , mainly on his views about California and its history , but only Race Life of the Aryan Peoples was commercially published . 
 He died at 96 , having seen Los Angeles become a major city and seaport . One of the " most conspicuous Southern Californians of his generation " , Widney was a cultural leader in Los Angeles for nearly seventy years .

 Joseph Pomeroy Widney was born December 26 , 1841 in Piqua , Ohio . The third son of John Wilson Widney and Arabella Maclay Widney , Widney was a nephew of Robert Samuel Maclay , and Charles Maclay . His father died of pneumonia at the age of 42 , when Widney was 15 . 
 After graduating from Piqua High School , he entered Miami University at Oxford , Ohio where , for five months , he studied Latin , Greek , and the classics . In 1907 , he received an honorary Doctor of Laws ( LL.D. ) degree for his Race Life of the Aryan Peoples . 
 In 1861 he enlisted in the Union Army in the Civil War ( Ohio Volunteers ) . He served as a medical corpsman on ships on the Ohio and Mississippi rivers . He was discharged in 1862 due to physical and nervous collapse . 
 With the encouragement of his two older brothers and his uncle , Charles Maclay , in California , Widney sailed to San Francisco via Panama , arriving in November 1862 . He travelled throughout California , visited missions and lived with the Spanish @-@ speaking inhabitants .

 In 1868 , he was discharged and moved to Los Angeles . He began his medical practice on October 8 , 1868 , sharing offices with Dr. John Strother Griffin ( 1816 – 1898 ) . General William Tecumseh Sherman and Mexican <unk> Tiburcio Vasquez were among his patients . 
 Before the " Anti @-@ <unk> Law " enacted in 1876 , doctors were not licensed . Medical practitioners would advertise their medical skills . On January 31 , 1871 , Dr Widney helped found the Los Angeles County Medical Association , the oldest such association in California . 
 The founders wanted to establish medical schools and publications , and raise medical standards Widney advocated aid to " the sickly poor " as a facet of public health and civic philanthropy .

 While at Drum Barracks and in Arizona , Widney became interested in climatology and conservation . He was chairman of the Los Angeles Meteorological committee for several years . Widney credited white settlement with improvements in the Southern California climate , including less variation in temperature , milder winds , and increased rainfall . He was concerned about water conservation , and warned what is now called smog , identifying it as a concern in 1938 , well before it gained official recognition in Los Angeles . 
 Widney sought the preservation of three great forest areas for future generations . 
 In January 1873 , Widney suggested the Colorado Desert be flooded to re @-@ establish Lake Cahuilla . 
 Horace Bell criticized the proposal in Reminiscences of a Ranger . 
 In his 1935 book , The Three Americas , Widney said that Atlantis was in the area where the Bahamas are located . He thought it was a semi @-@ tropical island , inhabited by peoples from the Americas rather than from Europe . He also believed that there was a submerged lost continent in the South Pacific Ocean .

 Widney saw the potential of Los Angeles on his first visit in January 1867 while posted to Drum Barracks . His brother , Robert Maclay Widney ( 1838 – 1929 ) , had arrived in Los Angeles in 1868 , and was a lawyer , and later judge , as well as the city 's first real estate agent . Robert Widney was also the publisher of The Real Estate Advertiser . Joseph Widney invested in real estate in the Los Angeles area , which made him financially independent , and allowed him to retire from the practice of medicine at 55 . In 1900 , the Los Angeles Times called him " an extensive property owner in this city " . At one time he owned the Widney Block on First Street , another Widney Block at Sixth and Broadway , and a property at the corner of Ninth and Santee streets , where he erected the Nazarene Methodist Episcopal Church . He also owned a building at 445 – 447 Aliso Street , where the first college of medicine for the University of Southern California was located from 1885 to 1896 . 
 His investment in land started early . Between April 29 , 1869 and August 28 , 1871 , he bought thirty @-@ four lots in Wilmington near the San Pedro harbor area and another 60 acres ( 240 @,@ 000 m2 ) near the San Gabriel Mission ( Rand 28 ) . He owned the parcel of land where the Los Angeles City Hall now stands , as well as much of Mt . Washington , Los Angeles , California , where his last home ( a Victorian mansion at <unk> Marmion Way ) stood . 
 During the Los Angeles boom in 1885 , Widney bought 35 @,@ 000 acres ( 142 km2 ) of land ( 75 miles ( 121 km ) northeast of Los Angeles ) comprising the relatively undeveloped township of Hesperia , California . Widney formed the Hesperia Land and Water Company to create a town . Horace Bell , in his On the Old West Coast , a personal reflection on that period , critiqued the boomers , as a " speculative conspiracy against all that was honest . " No houses were built in " <unk> . " 
 The Los Angeles Times of June 2 , 1887 said that Widney had purchased a hotel and several bath houses in the town of Iron @-@ Sulphur Springs , once known as Fulton Wells and now as Santa Fe Springs , fifteen miles ( 24 km ) east of downtown Los Angeles . In 1886 the springs were purchased by the Santa Fe Railroad , which renamed the town after itself . 
 Widney said , " We may look lovingly back on log cabin days , but the looking back must be done over a multi @-@ lane highway , not along a cow track " . He supported the development of Los Angeles even at the age of 95 . In 1937 he wrote " A Plan for the Development of Los Angeles as a Great World Health Center . " To develop Los Angeles , Widney proposed roads and tunnels to cross the Sierra Madre Mountains , linking the city and the interior desert . According to Carl Rand , Widney postulated : 
 The whole future of the city lies within our own hands . Los Angeles Harbor ( which ought to have been larger and deeper ) ; the great Desert City which may be ; and the Colorado River water system ; these are the three factors which will settle the future of the City of Los Angeles . And the time to strike is now ! 
 Jaher lists Widney as among those Los Angeles entrepreneurs who were the " most avid civic boosters ... [ who ] made sanguine by their triumphs , they expect urban growth to bring further gains ... [ who ] predicted that the city would become a great metropolis " . Widney envisioned Los Angeles " developing into the health capital of the world , a <unk> of holistic health culture " . 
 He was a member of the Los Angeles Chamber of Commerce from October 1888 . His first two books promoted California . In California of the South ( 1888 ) , described by David Fine as " one of the earliest booster tracts " Widney and Walter Lindley wrote : " The health @-@ seeker who , after suffering in both mind and body , after vainly trying the cold climate of Minnesota and the warm climate of Florida , after visiting Mentone , Cannes , and Nice , after traveling to Cuba and Algiers , and noticing that he is losing ounce upon ounce of flesh , and his cheeks have grown more sunken , his appetite more capricious , his breath more hurried , that his temperature is no longer normal , ... turns with a gleam of hope toward the Occident " — by which they meant Southern California . Many people followed that gleam and found it something more than hope " .

 Widney helped define the railroad , maritime and commercial policy of Southern California . He and Robert were entrepreneurial professionals . They were " effective lobbyists for the Southern Pacific [ railroad ] and for harbor improvements " and were " active in transport enterprises and in the development of the San Pedro harbor " . 
 In 1871 , Widney wanted Los Angeles to have a harbor , and with Phineas Banning successfully lobbied the United States Congress for funding for the harbor at San Pedro , California ( the Port of Los Angeles ) . He was chairman of the Los Angeles Citizens ' Committee on the Wilmington Harbor . He successfully opposed the attempt of the railroad interests of Collis Potter Huntington and his partners from claiming the state tidelands of the harbor for their own purposes , ensuring these lands remained in public hands . 
 Widney supported dividing the state of California and establishing the commonwealth of Southern California . He was regarded as " one of the ablest and most enthusiastic advocates of the new ' California of the South ' " . For many years Widney advocated the division of the state of California into at least two states , in order to maximize its representation in the U.S. Senate . He indicated in 1880 that " the topography , geography , climatic and commercial laws all work for the separation of California into two distinct civil organizations " . In 1888 , Widney said that " two distinct peoples are growing up in the state , and the time is rapidly drawing near when the separation which the working of natural laws is making in the people must become a separation of civil laws as well " . 
 In his book The Three Americas ( 1935 ) , Widney suggested that the United States , Canada , the United Kingdom , Australia , New Zealand , and South Africa form an Anglo @-@ Saxon federation with freedom of migration and a common citizenship . 
 While Republican in general politics , he was " an earnest worker in the cause of temperance " . In an 1886 Los Angeles Times op @-@ ed piece Widney suggested that the liquor question – the restriction of its manufacture and sale – should not only become the subject of a Republican party platform plank but should be the issue around which the party rebuilt itself . He was interested in the progress of prohibition , and served as head of the city 's nonpartisan anti @-@ saloon league . 
 Widney is regarded as " the outstanding early educator of Los Angeles " . 
 He was involved in the University of Southern California from its conception in 1879 , and served as a member of the Board of Trustees of USC from 1880 to 1895 . 
 He was heavily responsible for the creation of the USC College of Medicine in 1885 at the beginning of a three @-@ year " boom " cycle in Los Angeles , and served as founding dean , a responsibility he accepted for the next eleven years until his resignation on September 22 , 1896 . According to Michael Carter , " the University Catalogue for the academic year 1884 – 85 declared that applicants to the medical school , as to the rest of USC , would not be denied admission because of ' race , color , religion or sex . ' " 
 After the death of USC founding president Marion McKinley Bovard on December 30 , 1891 , the Board of Trustees elected Widney as the second president . After he " recognized a call of the Lord " , he accepted the presidency at a difficult time in the history of the young institution , which had only twenty @-@ five undergraduate students with a focus was on providing secondary education . 
 The College of Liberal Arts was eighteen thousand dollars in debt . He first set up a separate governing board for the College of Liberal Arts , both to refinance the debt and of tying that branch of the institution more closely to California Methodism . He raised $ 15 @,@ 000 , giving his own personal security to back up the loans , saving USC from bankruptcy . The Southern California Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church increased its support for USC in 1893 . The Conference " enthusiastically adopted Widney 's new financial program for the institution . Two of the church 's most distinguished and trusted leaders , Widney and Phineas F. Bresee , were at the helm . By the time of the annual conference of 1894 , the university had passed through its financial crisis , and Widney 's principal work was done " . In the spring of 1895 , Widney resigned after " four years of intensive <unk> service to the university as its president " . He announced his intention to spend a year studying in the East . The board finally accepted the resignation , after their benefactor had turned aside repeated requests that he reconsider his decision . 
 In addition to his responsibilities at USC , Widney served several years as a member and president of the Los Angeles Board of Education . 
 In October 1894 at the dedication of the Peniel Hall , Widney announced his intention to organize a Training Institute , in which Bible and practical nursing were to be the principal studies .

 Widney was raised in the Greene Street Methodist Episcopal Church in Piqua , Ohio . His uncle , Robert Samuel Maclay , was the first Methodist missionary to China , and an early Methodist missionary to Japan and Korea . 
 In the Los Angeles First Methodist Episcopal Church , the <unk> were members of the " District Aid Committee , " an organization devoted to securing better support for underpaid pastors . 
 He supported the Los Angeles City Mission ( the Peniel Mission ) , founded in 1886 as the Los Angeles Mission and was non @-@ denominational and nonsectarian . 
 Bresee and Widney wanted a church for the poor . They announced a service for October 6 , 1895 , in Red Men 's Hall near the Peniel Mission . On October 30 , 1895 , Bresee and Widney organised the Church of the Nazarene . Widney suggested the name of the new church . 
 Widney returned to the Methodist church as a pastor and was appointed to the church 's City Mission of Los Angeles ( formally organized in 1908 ) , where he ministered to thousands over the next several years . 
 In 1899 , he was the pastor of the Nazarene Methodist Episcopal Church . Growth of the congregation led to the building of a 500 @-@ seat building . He paid the full cost of construction and ministered without compensation . The new building was dedicated on June 3 , 1900 . In 1903 this church was renamed the Beth @-@ El Methodist Episcopal Church . Widney resigned from the Methodist Episcopal church in 1911 . 
 Widney was influenced by the teachings of preacher David Swing and Thomas Starr King , a broad @-@ minded , religiously inclusive Unitarian minister . Widney described King as " one of the few great and broad @-@ minded spirits of the church " ( <unk> , <unk> . ) [ 18 ] . 
 = = Racial beliefs = = 
 Widney lamented the decline in influence and power of the original Hispanic population of California . Widney said , " you could visit the hospitals and almshouses in the late ' eighties and look in vain for the Mexican or the Spaniard . " 
 Widney in his 1876 History indicates : " In the spring of 1850 , probably three or four colored persons were in the city . In 1875 , they numbered 175 souls , many of whom hold good city property acquired by industry . They are farmers , mechanics , or some other useful occupation , and remarkable for good habits " . 
 African @-@ American activist W. E. B. Du Bois used Widney 's Race Life of the Aryan Peoples to support his own view of the significance of the contributions of blacks to the development of modern civilization . Widney wrote " They [ the Negroes ] once occupied a much wider territory and wielded a vastly greater influence upon earth than they do now . " 
 In The Three Americas ( 1935 ) , Widney suggested that the United States buy British Guiana from the United Kingdom and give it to the African Americans as reparations for slavery .

 Widney attributed his longevity to living simply and keeping busy . At age 94 , Widney advocated " no liquor , no tobacco , no drugs . I 'm not a fanatic on liquor , but to me it is a medicine . I keep it around and take it when I need it . But there is no excuse whatever for tobacco or drugs " . He recommended at least eight hours sleep each night and short naps throughout the day . 
 He died at 10 : 50 am on July 4 , 1938 in his home in Highland Park , Los Angeles , California , aged 96 . After services held in his home , he was buried at the Evergreen Cemetery at Boyle Heights , Los Angeles , California on July 6 , 1938 . 
 In March 1939 the new Crippled Children 's High School was renamed the Dr. Joseph Pomeroy Widney High School . This school is for those aged 13 to 22 with special educational needs . The Widney Hall Alumni House at the University of Southern California ) Widney Hall , the university 's original building , was declared a Los Angeles Historic @-@ Cultural Monument ( No. 70 ) on December 16 , 1970 . The University of Southern California honors its distinguished graduates by presenting the Widney Alumni Award . His portrait was painted by American artist <unk> Mae <unk> , and a bust of Widney was sculpted by Emil <unk> .

 = Battle of the Netherlands = 
 The Battle of the Netherlands ( Dutch : Slag om Nederland ) was part of Case Yellow ( German : Fall Gelb ) , the German invasion of the Low Countries ( Belgium , Luxembourg , and the Netherlands ) and France during World War II . 
 The battle lasted from 10 May 1940 until the main Dutch forces surrendered on the 14th . Dutch troops in the province of Zealand continued to resist the Wehrmacht until 17 May when Germany completed its occupation of the whole nation . 
 The Battle of the Netherlands saw one of the first major uses of paratroopers to occupy crucial targets prior to ground troops reaching the area . The German Luftwaffe utilised paratroopers in the capture of several major airfields in the Netherlands in and around key cities such as Rotterdam and The Hague in order to quickly overrun the nation and immobilise Dutch forces . 
 The battle ended soon after the devastating bombing of Rotterdam by the German Luftwaffe and the subsequent threat by the Germans to bomb other large Dutch cities if Dutch forces refused to surrender . The Dutch General Staff knew it could not stop the bombers and surrendered in order to prevent other cities from suffering the same fate . The Netherlands remained under German occupation until 1945 , when the last Dutch territory was liberated . 
 = = Background = = 
 Britain and France declared war on Germany in 1939 , following the German invasion of Poland , but no major land operations occurred in Western Europe during the period known as the Phoney War in the winter of 1939 – 1940 . During this time , the British and French built up their forces in expectation of a long war , and the Germans completed their conquest of Poland . On 9 October , Adolf Hitler ordered plans to be made for an invasion of the Low Countries , to use them as a base against Great Britain and to pre @-@ empt a similar attack by the Allied forces , which could threaten the vital Ruhr Area . 
 The Dutch were ill @-@ prepared to resist such an invasion . When Hitler came to power , the Dutch had begun to re @-@ arm , but more slowly than France or Belgium ; only in 1936 did the defence budget start to be gradually increased . Successive Dutch governments tended to avoid openly identifying Germany as an acute military threat . Partly this was caused by a wish not to antagonise a vital trade partner , even to the point of repressing criticism of Nazi policies ; partly it was made inevitable by a policy of strict budgetary limits with which the conservative Dutch governments tried in vain to fight the Great Depression , which hit Dutch society particularly hard . Hendrikus Colijn , prime minister between 1933 and 1939 , was personally convinced Germany would not violate Dutch neutrality ; senior officers made no effort to mobilise public opinion in favour of improving military defence . 
 International tensions grew in the late 1930s . Crises were caused by the German occupation of the Rhineland in 1936 ; the Anschluss and Sudeten crisis of 1938 ; and the German occupation of Bohemia and Moravia and the Italian invasion of Albania in the spring of 1939 . These events forced the Dutch government to exercise greater vigilance , but they limited their reaction as much as they could . The most important measure was a partial mobilisation of 100 @,@ 000 men in April 1939 . 
 After the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 and the ensuing outbreak of the Second World War , the Netherlands hoped to remain neutral , as they had done during the First World War 25 years earlier . To ensure this neutrality , the Dutch army was mobilised from 24 August and entrenched . Large sums ( almost 900 million guilders ) were spent on defence . It proved very difficult to obtain new matériel in wartime , however , especially as the Dutch had ordered some of their new equipment from Germany , which deliberately delayed deliveries . Moreover , a considerable part of the funds were intended for the Dutch East Indies ( now Indonesia ) , much of it related to a plan to build three battlecruisers . 
 The strategic position of the Low Countries , located between France and Germany on the uncovered flanks of their fortification lines , made the area a logical route for an offensive by either side . In a 20 January 1940 radio speech , Winston Churchill tried to convince them not to wait for an inevitable German attack , but to join the Anglo @-@ French Entente . Both the Belgians and Dutch refused , even though the German attack plans had fallen into Belgian hands after a German aircraft crash in January 1940 in what became known as the Mechelen Incident . 
 The French supreme command considered violating the neutrality of the Low Countries if they had not joined the Anglo @-@ French coalition before the planned large Entente offensive in the summer of 1941 , but the French Cabinet , fearing a negative public reaction , vetoed the idea . Kept into consideration was a plan to invade if Germany attacked the Netherlands alone , necessitating an Entente advance through Belgium , or if the Netherlands assisted the enemy by tolerating a German advance into Belgium through the southern part of their territory , both possibilities discussed as part of the <unk> Hollande . The Dutch government never officially formulated a policy on how to act in case of either contingency ; the majority of ministers preferred to resist an attack , a minority and Queen Wilhelmina of the Netherlands refused to become a German ally whatever the circumstances . The Dutch tried on several occasions to act as an intermediary to reach a negotiated peace settlement between the Entente and Germany . 
 After the German invasion of Norway and Denmark , followed by a warning by the new Japanese naval attaché Captain Tadashi <unk> that a German attack on the Netherlands was certain , it became clear to the Dutch military that staying out of the conflict might prove impossible . They started to fully prepare for war , both mentally and physically . Dutch border troops were put on greater alert . Reports of the presumed actions of a Fifth Column in Scandinavia caused widespread fears that the Netherlands too had been infiltrated by German agents assisted by traitors . Countermeasures were taken against a possible assault on airfields and ports . On 19 April a state of emergency was declared . However , most civilians still cherished the illusion that their country might be spared , an attitude that after the war has been described as a state of denial . The Dutch hoped that the restrained policy of the Entente and Central Powers during the First World War might be repeated and tried to avoid the attention of the Great Powers and a war in which they feared a loss of human life comparable to that of the previous conflict . On 10 April Britain and France repeated their request that the Dutch enter the war on their side , but were again refused .

 In the Netherlands , all the objective conditions were present for a successful defence : a dense population , wealthy , young , disciplined and well @-@ educated ; a geography favouring the defender ; and a strong technological and industrial base including an armaments industry . However , these had not been exploited : while the Wehrmacht at the time still had many shortcomings in equipment and training , the Dutch army in comparison was like David compared to Goliath . The myth of the general German equipment advantage over the opposing armies in the Battle of France was in fact a reality in the case of the Battle of the Netherlands . On the one hand there was the modern German army with tanks and dive bombers ( such as the Junkers Ju 87 Stuka ) and on the other hand the Dutch army , whose armoured forces comprised only 39 armoured cars and five tankettes , and an air force for a large part consisting of biplanes . The Dutch government 's attitude towards war was reflected in the state of the country 's armed forces , which had not significantly expanded their equipment since before the First World War , and were inadequately armed even by the standards of 1918 . During the 1920s , an economic recession lasting from 1920 until 1927 and the general détente in international relations caused a limitation of the defence budget . In that decade , only 1 @.@ 5 million guilders per annum was spent on equipment . Both in 1931 and 1933 , commissions appointed to economise even further failed , because they concluded that the acceptable minimum had been reached and advised that a spending increase was urgently needed . Only in February 1936 was a bill passed creating a special 53 @.@ 4 million guilder defence fund . 
 The lack of a trained manpower base , a large professional organisation or a sufficient matériel reserve precluded a swift expansion of Dutch forces . There was just enough artillery to equip the larger units : eight infantry divisions ( combined in four Army Corps ) , one Light ( i.e. motorised ) Division and two independent brigades ( Brigade A and Brigade B ) , each with the strength of half a division or five battalions . All other infantry combat unit troops were raised as light infantry battalions that were dispersed all over the territory to delay enemy movement . They made use of many pillboxes , about two thousand in number , but in lines without any depth . Modern large fortresses like the Belgian stronghold of Eben Emael were nonexistent ; the only modern fortification complex was that at Kornwerderzand , guarding the <unk> . Total Dutch forces equalled 48 regiments of infantry as well as 22 infantry battalions for strategic border defence . In comparison , Belgium , despite a smaller and more aged male population , fielded 22 full divisions and the equivalent of 30 divisions when smaller units were included . 
 After September 1939 , desperate efforts were made to improve the situation , but with very little result . Germany , for obvious reasons , delayed its deliveries ; France was hesitant to equip an army that would not unequivocally take its side . The one abundant source of readily available weaponry , the Soviet Union , was inaccessible because the Dutch , contrary to most other nations , did not recognise the communist regime . An attempt in 1940 to procure Soviet armour captured by Finland failed . 
 On 10 May , the most conspicuous deficiency of the Dutch Army lay in its shortage of armour . Whereas the other major participants all had a considerable armoured force , the Netherlands had not been able to obtain the minimum of 146 modern tanks ( 110 light , 36 medium ) they had already considered necessary in 1937 . A single Renault FT tank , for which just one driver had been trained and which had the sole task of testing antitank obstacles , had remained the only example of its kind and was no longer in service by 1940 . There were two squadrons of armoured cars , each with a dozen Landsverk M36 or M38 vehicles ; another dozen DAF M39 cars were in the process of being taken into service , some still having to be fitted with their main armament . A single platoon of five Carden @-@ Loyd Mark VI tankettes used by the Artillery completed the list of Dutch armour . 
 The Dutch Artillery had available a total of 676 howitzers and field guns : 310 Krupp 75 mm field guns , partly produced in licence ; 52 105 mm Bofors howitzers , the only really modern pieces ; 144 obsolete Krupp 125 mm guns ; 40 150 mm <unk> 's ; 72 Krupp 150 mm L / 24 howitzers and 28 Vickers 152 mm L / 15 howitzers . As antitank @-@ guns 386 <unk> 47 mm L / 39s were available , which were effective weapons but too few in number , being only at a third of the planned strength ; another three hundred antiquated 6 Veld ( 57 mm ) and 8 Staal ( 84 mm ) field guns performed the same role for the covering forces . Only eight of the 120 modern 105 mm pieces ordered from Germany had been delivered at the time of the invasion . Most artillery was horse @-@ drawn . 
 The Dutch Infantry used about 2 @,@ 200 7 @.@ 92 mm Schwarzlose <unk> machine guns , partly licence produced , and eight hundred Vickers machine guns . Many of these were fitted in the pillboxes ; each battalion had a heavy machine gun company of twelve . The Dutch infantry squads were equipped with an organic light machine gun , the <unk> Lewis machine gun of which about eight thousand were available . This weapon was prone to jamming and not very suitable for offensive operations . Most Dutch infantry were equipped with the Dutch <unk> rifle , a variant of the <unk> <unk> . This weapon had been in service with the Dutch military for over 40 years and its obsolescence had become obvious , but the Dutch military did not have the money to replace it . There were but six 80 mm mortars for each regiment . This lack of firepower impaired the fighting performance of the Dutch infantry . 
 Despite the Netherlands being the seat of Philips , one of Europe 's largest producers of radio equipment , the Dutch army mostly used telephone connections ; only the Artillery had been equipped with the modest number of 225 radio sets . 
 = = = Dutch Air Forces = = = 
 The Dutch air force , which was not an independent arm of the Dutch armed forces , but part of the Army , on 10 May operated a fleet of 155 aircraft : 28 Fokker <unk> twin @-@ engine destroyers ; 31 Fokker <unk> and seven Fokker <unk> fighters ; ten twin @-@ engined Fokker T.V , fifteen Fokker <unk> and 35 Fokker C.V light bombers , twelve Douglas DB @-@ 8 dive bombers ( used as fighters ) and seventeen Koolhoven FK @-@ 51 reconnaissance aircraft — thus 74 of the 155 aircraft were biplanes . Of these aircraft 125 were operational . Of the remainder the air force school used three Fokker <unk> , six Fokker <unk> , a single Fokker <unk> , a single Fokker T.V and seven Fokker C.V , along with several training airplanes . Another forty operational aircraft served with the marine air service along with about an equal number of reserve and training craft . The production potential of the Dutch military aircraft industry , consisting of Fokker and Koolhoven , was not fully exploited due to budget limitations . 
 = = = = Training and readiness = = = = 
 Not only was the Dutch Army poorly equipped , it was also poorly trained . There had especially been little experience gained in the handling of larger units above the battalion level . From 1932 until 1936 , the Dutch Army did not hold summer field manoeuvres in order to conserve military funding . Also , the individual soldier lacked many necessary skills . Before the war only a minority of young men eligible to serve in the military had actually been conscripted . Until 1938 , those who were enlisted only served for 24 weeks , just enough to receive basic infantry training . That same year , service time was increased to eleven months . The low quality of conscripts was not compensated by a large body of professional military personnel . In 1940 there were only 1206 professional officers present ; It had been hoped that when war threatened , these deficiencies could be quickly remedied but following the mobilisation of all Dutch forces on 28 August 1939 ( bringing Army strength to about 280 @,@ 000 men ) readiness only slowly improved : most available time was spent constructing defences . During this period , munition shortages limited live fire training , while unit cohesion remained low . By its own standards the Dutch Army in May 1940 was unfit for battle . It simply could not stage a major offensive , let alone execute manoeuvre warfare . 
 German generals and tacticians ( along with Hitler himself ) had an equally low opinion of the Dutch military and expected that the core region of Holland proper could be conquered in about three to five days .

 = = = = Structural elements = = = = 
 In the 17th century , the Dutch Republic had devised an effective defensive system called the Holland Water Line , which could protect all major cities in the west by flooding part of the countryside . In the early 19th century this line was shifted somewhat to the east , beyond Utrecht , and later modernised with fortresses . This new position was called the New Holland Water Line . The line was reinforced with new pillboxes in 1940 as the fortifications were outdated . The line was located at the extreme eastern edge of the area lying below sea level . This allowed the ground before the fortifications to be easily inundated with a few feet of water , too shallow for boats , but deep enough to turn the soil into an impassable quagmire . The area west of the New Holland Water Line was called Fortress Holland ( Dutch : Vesting Holland ; German : Festung Holland ) , the eastern flank of which was also covered by Lake IJssel and the southern flank protected by the lower course of three broad parallel rivers : two effluents of the Rhine , and the Meuse ( or Maas ) . It functioned as a National Redoubt , which was expected to hold out a prolonged period of time , in the most optimistic predictions as much as three months without any allied assistance , even though the size of the attacking German force was strongly overestimated . Before the war the intention was to fall back to this position almost immediately , after a concentration phase ( the so @-@ called Case Blue ) in the <unk> <unk> , inspired by the hope that Germany would only travel through the southern provinces on its way to Belgium and leave Holland proper untouched . In 1939 it was understood such an attitude posed an invitation to invasion and made it impossible to negotiate with the Entente about a common defence . Proposals by German diplomats that the Dutch government would secretly assent to an advance into the country were rejected . 
 From September 1939 a more easterly Main Defence Line ( MDL ) was constructed . This second main defensive position had a northern part formed by the <unk> ( Grebbe line ) , located at the foothills of the <unk> <unk> , an Ice Age moraine between Lake IJssel and the Lower Rhine . It was dug on instigation of the commander of the Field Army Lieutenant @-@ General Jan Joseph Godfried baron van Voorst tot Voorst . This line was extended by a southern part : the Peel @-@ <unk> ( Peel @-@ Raam Position ) , located between the river Maas and the Belgian border along the Peel Marshes and the Raam rivulet , as ordered by the Dutch Commander in Chief , General Izaak H. Reijnders . In the south the intention was to delay the Germans as much as possible to cover a French advance . Fourth and Second Army Corps were positioned at the Grebbe Line ; Third Army Corps were stationed at the Peel @-@ Raam Position with the Light Division behind it to cover its southern flank . Brigade A and B were positioned between the Lower Rhine and the Maas . First Army Corps was a strategic reserve in the Fortress Holland , the southern perimeter of which was manned by another ten battalions and the eastern by six battalions . All these lines were reinforced by pillboxes . 
 = = = = Positioning of troops = = = = 
 In front of this Main Defence Line was the IJssel @-@ <unk> , a covering line along the rivers IJssel and Maas , connected by positions in the <unk> , again with pillboxes and lightly occupied by a screen of fourteen " border battalions " . Late in 1939 General Van Voorst tot Voorst , reviving plans he had already worked out in 1937 , proposed to make use of the excellent defensive opportunities these rivers offered . He proposed a shift to a more mobile strategy by fighting a delaying battle at the plausible crossing sites near Arnhem and Gennep to force the German divisions to spend much of their offensive power before they had reached the MDL , and ideally even defeat them . This was deemed too risky by the Dutch government and General Reijnders . The latter wanted the army to first offer heavy resistance at the Grebbe Line and Peel Raam Position , and then fall back to the Fortress Holland . This also was considered too dangerous by the government , especially in light of German air supremacy , and had the disadvantage of having to fully prepare two lines . Reijnders had already been denied full military authority in the defence zones ; the conflict about strategy further undermined his political position . On 5 February 1940 he was forced to offer his resignation because of these disagreements with his superiors . He was replaced by General Henry G. Winkelman who decided that in the north the Grebbe Line would be the main defence line where the decisive battle was to be waged , partly because it would there be easier to break out with a counteroffensive if the conditions were favourable . However , he took no comparable decision regarding the Peel @-@ Raam Position . 
 During the Phoney War the Netherlands officially adhered to a policy of strict neutrality . In secret , the Dutch military command , partly acting on its own accord , negotiated with both Belgium and France via the Dutch military attaché in Paris , Lieutenant @-@ Colonel David van Voorst <unk> to coordinate a common defence to a German invasion . This failed because of insurmountable differences of opinion about the question of which strategy to follow . 
 = = = = Coordinating with Belgium = = = = 
 Given its obvious strategic importance , Belgium , though in principle neutral , had already made quite detailed arrangements for coordination with Entente troops . This made it difficult for the Dutch to have these plans changed again to suit their wishes . The Dutch desired the Belgians to connect their defences to the Peel @-@ Raam Position , that Reijnders refused to abandon without a fight . He did not approve of a plan by Van Voorst tot Voorst to occupy a so @-@ called " Orange Position " on the much shorter line ' s @-@ Hertogenbosch – Tilburg , to form a continuous front with the Belgian lines near Turnhout as proposed by Belgian General Raoul van Overstraeten . 
 When Winkelman took over command , he intensified the negotiations , proposing on 21 February that Belgium would man a connecting line with the Peel Raam Position along the Belgian part of the Zuid @-@ Willemsvaart . The Belgians refused to do this unless the Dutch reinforced their presence in Limburg ; the Dutch had no forces available with which to fulfill this request . Repeated Belgian requests to reconsider the Orange Position were refused by Winkelman . Therefore , the Belgians decided to withdraw , in the event of an invasion , all their troops to their main defence line , the Albert Canal . This created a dangerous gap forty kilometres wide . The French were invited to fill it . Now the French Commander in Chief General Maurice Gamelin was more than interested in including the Dutch in his continuous front as , like Major @-@ General Bernard Montgomery four years later , he hoped to circle around the Westwall when the Entente launched its planned 1941 offensive . But he did not dare to stretch his supply lines that far unless the Belgians and Dutch would take the allied side before the German attack . When both nations refused , Gamelin made it clear that he would occupy a connecting position near Breda . The Dutch did not fortify this area . In secret , Winkelman decided on 30 March to abandon the Peel @-@ Raam Position immediately at the onset of a German attack and withdraw his Third Army Corps to the Linge to cover the southern flank of the Grebbe Line , leaving only a covering force behind . This Waal @-@ Linge Position was to be reinforced with pillboxes ; the budget for such structures was increased with a hundred million guilders . 
 After the German attack on Denmark and Norway in April 1940 , when the Germans used large numbers of airborne troops , the Dutch command became worried about the possibility they too could become the victim of such a strategic assault . To repulse an attack , five infantry battalions were positioned at the main ports and airbases , such as The Hague airfield of Ypenburg and the Rotterdam airfield of Waalhaven . These were reinforced by additional AA @-@ guns , two tankettes and twelve of the 24 operational armoured cars . These specially directed measures were accompanied by more general ones : the Dutch had posted no less than 32 hospital ships throughout the country and fifteen trains to help make troop movements easier . 
 = = = French strategy = = = 
 In addition to the Dutch Army and the German 18th Army , a third force , not all that much smaller than either , would operate on Dutch soil : the French 7th Army . It had its own objectives within the larger French strategy , and French planning had long considered the possibility of operations in Dutch territory . The coastal regions of Zealand and Holland were difficult to negotiate because of their many waterways . However , both the French and the Germans saw the possibility of a surprise flanking attack in this region . For the Germans this would have the advantage of bypassing the Antwerp @-@ Namur line . The Zealand Isles were considered to be strategically critical , as they are just opposite the Thames estuary , so their capture would pose a special menace to the safety of England . 
 Rapid forces , whether for an offensive or defensive purpose , were needed to deny vital locations to the enemy . Long before the Germans did , the French had contemplated using airborne troops to achieve speedy attacks . As early as 1936 the French had commissioned the design of light airborne tanks , but these plans had been abandoned in 1940 , as they possessed no cargo planes large enough to carry them . A naval division and an infantry division were earmarked to depart for Zealand to block the Western Scheldt against a German crossing . These would send forward forces over the Scheldt estuary into the Isles , supplied by overseas shipping . 
 French Commander in Chief General Maurice Gamelin feared the Dutch would be tempted into a quick capitulation or even an acceptance of German protection . He therefore reassigned the former French strategic reserve , the 7th Army , to operate in front of Antwerp to cover the river 's eastern approaches in order to maintain a connection with the Fortress Holland further to the north and preserve an allied left flank beyond the Rhine . The force assigned to this task consisted of the 16th Army Corps , comprising the 9th Motorised Infantry Division ( also possessing some tracked armoured vehicles ) and the 4th Infantry Division ; and the 1st Army Corps , consisting of the 25th Motorised Infantry Division and the 21st Infantry Division . This army was later reinforced by the 1st Mechanised Light Division , an armoured division of the French Cavalry and a first class powerful unit . Together with the two divisions in Zealand , seven French divisions were dedicated to the operation . 
 Although the French troops would have a higher proportion of motorised units than their German adversaries , in view of the respective distances to be covered , they could not hope to reach their assigned sector advancing in battle deployment before the enemy did . Their only prospect of beating the Germans to it lay in employing rail transport . This implied they would be vulnerable in the concentration phase , building up their forces near Breda . They needed the Dutch troops in the Peel @-@ Raam Position to delay the Germans for a few extra days to allow a French deployment and entrenchment , but French rapid forces also would provide a security screen . These consisted of the reconnaissance units of the armoured and motorised divisions , equipped with the relatively well @-@ armed Panhard 178 armoured car . These would be concentrated into two task forces named after their commander : the Groupe <unk> and the Groupe <unk> . 
 = = = German strategy and forces = = = 
 During the many changes in the operational plans for Fall Gelb the idea of leaving the Fortress Holland alone , just as the Dutch hoped for , was at times considered . The first version of 19 October 1939 suggested the possibility of a full occupation if conditions were favourable . In the version of 29 October it was proposed to limit the transgression to a line south of Venlo . In the Holland @-@ Weisung ( Holland Directive ) of 15 November it was decided to conquer the entire south , but in the north to advance no further than the Grebbe Line , and to occupy the Frisian Isles . Hermann Göring insisted on a full conquest as he needed the Dutch airfields against Britain ; also he was afraid the Entente might reinforce Fortress Holland after a partial defeat and use the airfields to bomb German cities and troops . Another rationale for complete conquest was that as the fall of France itself could hardly be taken for granted , it was for political reasons seen as desirable to obtain a Dutch capitulation , because a defeat might well bring less hostile governments to power in Britain and France . A swift defeat would also free troops for other front sectors . 
 Though it was thus on 17 January 1940 decided to conquer the whole of the Netherlands , few units could be made available for this task . The main effort of Fall Gelb would be made in the centre , between Namur and Sedan , France . The attack at central Belgium was only a feint ; and the attack at Fortress Holland only a side show of this feint . Although both the 6th and 18th Army were deployed at the Dutch border , the first , much larger , force would move south of Venlo to Belgium , leaving just the 18th Army under General Georg von Küchler to defeat the Dutch main force . Of all German armies to take part in the operation this was by far the weakest . It contained only four regular infantry divisions ( the 207th , 227th , 254th and 256th Infantry Division ) , assisted by three reserve divisions ( 208th , 225th , and 526th Infantry Division ) that would not take part in the fighting . Six of these divisions were " Third Wave " units only raised in August 1939 from territorial Landwehr units . They had few professional officers and little fighting experience apart from those who were World War I veterans . Like the Dutch Army , most soldiers ( 88 % ) were insufficiently trained . The seventh division was the 526th Infantry Division , a pure security unit without serious combat training . The German divisions , with a nominal strength of 17 @,@ 807 men , were fifty percent larger than their Dutch counterparts and possessed twice their effective firepower , but even so the necessary numerical superiority for a successful offensive was simply lacking . 
 To remedy this , assorted odds and ends were used to reinforce 18th Army . The first of these was the only German cavalry division , aptly named 1st Kavalleriedivision . The mounted troops of this unit , accompanied by some infantry , were to occupy the weakly defended provinces east of the river IJssel and then try to cross the <unk> ( Enclosure Dike ) . A simultaneous landing in Holland near <unk> was to be attempted , using barges to be captured in the small port of <unk> . As both efforts were unlikely to succeed , the mass of regular divisions was reinforced by the SS @-@ <unk> ( including SS @-@ <unk> Der Führer , Deutschland and Germania ) and Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler , which would serve as assault infantry to breach the Dutch fortified positions . Still this added only 11 ⁄ 3 division to the equation . 
 To ensure a victory the Germans resorted to unconventional means . The Germans had trained two airborne / airlanding assault divisions . The first of these , the 7 . Flieger @-@ Division , consisted of paratroopers ; the second , the 22nd <unk> @-@ Infanteriedivision , of airborne infantry . Initially the plan was that the main German assault was to take place in Flanders , and it was expected these troops would be used for a crossing attempt over the river Scheldt near Ghent . This operation was cancelled , so it was decided to use them to obtain an easy victory in the Netherlands . The airborne troops would on the first day attempt to secure the airfields around the Dutch seat of government , The Hague , and then capture that government , together with the Dutch High Command and Queen Wilhelmina . German officers actually took lessons on how to address royalty on such occasions . The plan , Fall Festung , had been developed by Hitler personally , embellishing an earlier idea to let an envoy offer " armed protection of the Dutch neutrality " , that is , to become a German protectorate . In the event this did not bring forth the desired immediate collapse , the bridges at Rotterdam , Dordrecht and Moerdijk would simultaneously be secured to allow a mechanised force to relieve the airborne troops from the south . This force was to be the German 9th Panzer Division . This was the only German armoured division having just two tank battalions , one understrength , in its single tank regiment ; the total number of tanks in the unit was 141 . The intention was that it should exploit a breach in the Dutch lines created by the 254th and 256th Infantry Division , and join up with them , forming the XXVI . Armeekorps , on the Gennep – ' s @-@ Hertogenbosch axis . At the same time an offensive would be staged against the Grebbe Line in the east by the 207th and 227th Infantry Division , united to form X. Armeekorps , to engage the main bulk of the Dutch Field Army . The expectation was that in spite of the lack of numerical superiority , they would force the Dutch back to the east front of the Fortress Holland or beyond . If the Dutch did not capitulate on the first day , the Eighteenth Army expected to enter the Fortress Holland on the third day from the south and thereby ensure victory ; there was no strict timetable for the total destruction of the Dutch forces . A peculiar aspect of the command structure was that the airborne attack was solely a Luftwaffe operation ; the airborne forces would initially not be under operational command of the German Army . The attack on Rotterdam was ultimately to be an Army operation and considered by it as the <unk> ( focal point ) of the campaign in the Netherlands ; 18th Army saw the air landings as primarily subservient to the XXVI . Armeekorps advance . 
 Of all operations of Fall Gelb this one most strongly embodied the concept of a Blitzkrieg as the term was then understood : a <unk> <unk> or strategic assault . Also , like Fall Gelb as a whole , it involved a high risk strategy . 
 = = The Oster affair = = 
 The German population and troops generally disliked the idea of violating Dutch neutrality . The German propaganda therefore justified the invasion as a reaction to a supposed Entente attempt to occupy the Low Countries , similar to the justification used by the German Empire to invade Belgium in World War I. Some German officers had an aversion against the Nazi regime and were also uneasy about the invasion . One of them , Colonel Hans Oster , an Abwehr ( German military intelligence ) officer , began in March 1939 to pass along information to his friend , the Dutch military attaché in Berlin Major <unk> J. Sas . This information included the attack date of Fall Gelb . Sas informed the Allies via other military attachés . However , both the Dutch government and other nations became insensitive to the series of false alarms , as the date would be changed many times , because the attack was postponed to wait for favourable weather conditions . Sas ' correct prediction of the date of the attack on Denmark and Norway went largely unheeded . Though he indicated a German armoured division would try to attack the Fortress Holland from North Brabant and that there was a plan to capture the Queen , the Dutch defensive strategy was not adapted and it was not understood these were elements of a larger scheme . On 4 May Sas again warned that an attack was imminent ; this time it coincided with a warning from Pope Pius XII . When in the evening of 9 May Oster again phoned his friend saying just " Tomorrow , at dawn " , the Dutch troops were put on alert . Oster was a leading figure of the German resistance from 1938 to 1943 , and was one of those hanged after the 20 July 1944 bomb plot to assassinate Hitler .

 = = = 10 May = = = 
 On the morning of 10 May 1940 the Dutch awoke to the sound of aircraft engines roaring in the sky . Germany had commenced operation Fall Gelb and attacked the Netherlands , Belgium , France and Luxembourg , in the case of the Low Countries without a declaration of war given before hostilities ; France was already at war . 
 In the night the Luftwaffe violated Dutch airspace . One wing , Kampfgeschwader 4 ( KG 4 ) , traversed it and then disappeared to the west , giving the Dutch the illusion that the operation was directed at England . But above the North Sea it turned to the east again to stage a surprise attack on the Dutch airfields , together with the other wings . Led by Oberst ( Colonel ) Martin Fiebig , KG 4 hit the naval airfield at De <unk> , destroying 35 aircraft , most of them trainers . Fiebig himself was shot down and spent five days as a Dutch prisoner of war . KG 4 also hit Amsterdam @-@ Schiphol , where the Dutch lost a third of their medium bombers , and The Hague airfields where I. / KG 4 destroyed half of the 21 defending fighters to assist Kampfgeschwader 30 ( KG 30 ) and Kampfgeschwader 54 ( KG 54 ) in attacks upon ports and communications . KG 4 lost 11 Heinkel He 111 bombers in total on 10 May and three Junkers Ju 88s ; KG 30 and 54 another nine bombers . Jagdgeschwader 26 ( JG 26 ) and Zerstörergeschwader 26 ( ZG 26 ) shot down 25 Dutch aircraft in aerial combat for a loss of nine fighters , with Albert Kesselring 's Luftflotte 2 in total claiming 41 . The Dutch were left with just 70 aircraft by the end of the day . They claimed most of the German aircraft destroyed on 10 May . Spread out over Dutch territory , they continued to engage the Luftwaffe where possible , claiming 13 victories over German fighter aircraft by 14 May . 
 Immediately after the bombardments , between 04 : 30 and 05 : 00 local time , paratroopers were landed near the airfields . Dutch anti @-@ aircraft batteries shot down numerous Ju 52 transport planes of the Luftwaffe 's <unk> . German Ju 52 losses in the entire battle amounted to about 250 , representing 50 % of the fleet 's strength . 
 The attack on The Hague ended in operational failure . The paratroopers were unable to capture the main airfield at Ypenburg in time for the airborne infantry to land safely in their Junkers . Though one armoured car had been damaged by a bomb , the other five <unk> , assisted by machine gun emplacements , destroyed the eighteen Junkers of the first two waves , killing many occupants . When the airstrip was blocked by wrecks the remaining waves aborted the landing and tried to find alternatives , often putting down their teams in meadows or on the beach , thus dispersing the troops . The small auxiliary airfield of <unk> was only lightly defended , and fell at once to German attack . The airfield of Valkenburg was likewise quickly occupied , the morale of the defenders shaken by the bombardment . However , the landing strip was still under construction and the ground water level had not yet been lowered : planes landing there sank away in the soft soil . None of the airfields were thus capable of receiving substantial reinforcements . In the end the paratroopers occupied Ypenburg but failed to advance into The Hague , their route blocked by hastily assembled Dutch troops . Early in the afternoon they were dispersed by fire from three Dutch artillery batteries . Dutch batteries likewise drove away the German occupants from the other two fields , the remnant airborne troops taking refuge in nearby villages and mansions . 
 The attack on Rotterdam was much more successful . Twelve Heinkel He 59 seaplanes , crowded with two platoons of troops , landed in the heart of the city and unloaded assault teams that conquered the Willemsbrug , a bridge over the Nieuwe Maas , to occupy a bridgehead . At the same time the military airfield of Waalhaven , positioned south of the city on the island of IJsselmonde , was attacked by airborne forces . Here an infantry battalion was stationed , but so close to the airfield that the paratroopers landed near its positions . A confused fight followed . The first wave of Junkers suffered no losses and the transports continued to land . In the end the Dutch defenders were overwhelmed . The German troops , steadily growing in numbers , began to move to the east to occupy IJsselmonde and eventually made contact with the paratroopers tasked with occupying the vital bridge at Dordrecht . Although the Royal Netherlands Navy intervened — the torpedo boats Z5 and TM 51 attacked the Willemsbrug and later the destroyer HNLMS Van Galen sailed up the Nieuwe <unk> to bombard the airfield at short range — this only resulted in the Van Galen foundering after being bombed . A plan to commit the gunboats HNLMS Flores and HNLMS Johan Maurits van Nassau was therefore abandoned . At the Island of Dordrecht the Dordrecht bridge was captured but in the city itself the garrison held out . The long Moerdijk bridges over the broad Hollands Diep estuary connecting the island to North Brabant province were captured and a bridgehead fortified on the southern side . 
 The Germans , executing a plan approved by Hitler , — though not contrived by him personally — tried to capture the IJssel and Maas bridges intact , using commando teams of Brandenburgers that began to infiltrate over the Dutch border ahead of the main advance , with some troops arriving on the evening of 9 May . During the night of 10 May they approached the bridges : several teams had a few men dressed as Dutch military police pretending to bring in a group of German prisoners , to fool the Dutch detonation teams . Some of these " military policemen " were real Dutchmen , members of the Nationaal @-@ <unk> Beweging , the Dutch Nazi party . Most of these attempts failed and the bridges were blown , on two occasions with Brandenburgers and all . The main exception was the Gennep railway bridge . Immediately an armoured train crossed it followed by a troop train , both driving right through the Peel @-@ Raam Position at Mill and unloading an infantry battalion behind the defence line . 
 The Dutch released reports of German soldiers in disguise to the international news agencies . This caused a fifth column scare , especially in Belgium and France . However , unlike the situation later on in those two countries , in the Netherlands there was no mass exodus of civilian refugees , clogging the roads . Generally German soldiers behaved in a civilised manner towards the Dutch population , forming neat queues at the shops to buy goods rationed in Germany , such as chocolate . 
 After the generally failed assaults on the bridges , the German divisions began crossing attempts over the rivers IJssel and Maas . The first waves typically were destroyed , due to insufficient preparatory fire on the pillboxes . At most places a secondary bombardment destroyed the pillboxes and the infantry divisions crossed the river after building pontoon bridges ; but at some , as Venlo , the attempt was aborted . At Arnhem , Leibstandarte Der Fuehrer led the assault and that day advanced to the Grebbe Line , followed by 207 . Infanteriedivision . 
 Even before the armoured train arrived , 3rd Army Corps had already been planned to be withdrawn from behind the Peel @-@ Raam Position , taking with it all the artillery apart from 36 8 Staal pieces . Each of its six regiments was to leave a battalion behind to serve as a covering force , together with fourteen " border battalions " . The group was called the " Peel Division " . This withdrawal was originally planned for the first night after the invasion , under cover of darkness , but due to the rapid German advance an immediate retreat was ordered at 06 : 45 , to avoid 3rd Army Corps becoming entangled with enemy troops . The corps joined " Brigade G " , six battalions already occupying the Waal @-@ Linge line , and was thus brought up to strength again . It would see no further fighting . 
 The Light Division , based at <unk> , was the only manoeuvre force the Dutch Army possessed . Its planned withdrawal had been similarly executed a day early . Its regiments had <unk> over the Maas and Waal bridges and then turned left through the Alblasserwaard when it was decided in the afternoon to let it counterattack the German airborne landing on IJsselmonde . It reached the Noord , the river separating the Alblasserwaard from IJsselmonde , in the evening . There they discovered that the sector near the only bridge , built in 1939 , was not strongly occupied by the airborne troops , as the Germans simply had not known of its existence because of outdated maps . It was decided to postpone a crossing until the next day , to gather sufficient forces . No attempt was made to establish a bridgehead . 
 Meanwhile , on the evening of the 10th , around 22 : 00 , French reconnaissance elements using Panhard 178 armoured cars had started to arrive at the Dutch border , forming a vanguard for the French 1st Mechanised Light Division . This division operated , with the 25e DIM on its left , on the northern flank of the French 7th Army ; its mission was to ensure contact between the Vesting Holland and Antwerp . Attempts to coordinate the French advance with Colonel Leonard Johannes Schmidt , the military commander of the Dutch troops on Noord @-@ Brabant , were largely unsuccessful as , apart from the fact he could not be reached that day , Dutch defences there were already collapsing . At Mill , 256 . Infanteriedivision at first could not exploit the opportunity offered by having a battalion in the back of the defenders because it failed to locate it . When a first attack by forward elements had been repulsed , a full assault at the Main Defense Line was initially postponed to the next day because most artillery had not yet passed the single pontoon bridge over the Meuse , which had caused a traffic jam after having been damaged by an incident . In the early evening in a sudden change of plans it was decided to attack even though artillery support was absent apart from one 105 mm battery . An unrequested Stuka attack that also happened to hit the Mill sector just prior to the advance routed some Dutch defenders , creating a weak section in the line from which the Dutch troops were dislodged . Though the Germans were slow to exploit the breakthrough , Colonel Schmidt at 20 : 30 ordered the Peel @-@ Raam Position to be abandoned and his troops to fall back to the west improvising a new line at the Zuid @-@ Willemsvaart canal . 
 In the North , by the end of the day , 1 . Kavalleriedivision had reached the line <unk> – Groningen , delayed by logistical problems and Dutch demolition teams blowing up 236 bridges . Dutch troop strength in that area was weak . 
 In the extreme south , the six border battalions in the province of Limburg only slightly delayed the advance of the German Sixth Army ; before noon the area had been overrun and the strategic city of Maastricht had surrendered , opening the way for the German feint offensive into Central Belgium . The Germans however , failed to capture the main bridge intact , forcing them to delay the crossing by the 4th Panzer Division until the next day . 
 = = = 11 May = = = 
 On 11 May the Dutch commander General Winkelman was faced with two priorities . First of all he wanted to eliminate the German airborne troops . Though the strategic assault had failed , he feared a further enemy build @-@ up via Waalhaven and saw the German possession of the Moerdijk bridges as a serious impediment to the movement of allied reinforcements to the Fortress Holland . The second priority was closely related to the first : enabling the French army to build up a strong defensive line in North Brabant , to connect the Fortress Holland with the Allied main force in Belgium . As he had withdrawn most of his troops from the area , Winkelman had only limited means available to influence this process , largely leaving this task to local commanders . 
 In both respects , little was achieved this day . The planned counterattack by the Light Division against the airborne troops on IJsselmonde failed . In the nick of time the bridge over the river Noord had been prepared for defence by the German paratroopers , and it proved impossible to force it . Several attempts to cross the river by boats only managed to establish some isolated bridgeheads , and at 10 : 15 , the Light Division was given permission to break off the crossing at this point and ordered to shift its axis of attack by reinforcing the Dutch troops on the Island of Dordrecht , where it arrived that night . After having cleared the Island of Dordrecht of enemy troops the division was to advance into IJsselmonde over the Dordrecht bridge in order to reach Rotterdam . 
 Earlier during the day , two attempts were made by Dutch battalions to carry out an attack against the western flank of the German perimeter . The first battalion , withdrawn from the Belgian border , partly crossed the Oude Maas at two points ( Oud @-@ <unk> and <unk> ) and tried to storm the bridge at <unk> into IJsselmonde ; the second battalion , taken from the Fortress Holland forces positioned at the Hoekse Waard , had already crossed the <unk> Kil into the Island of Dordrecht the previous day , using the ferry at <unk> and now tried to expand its bridgehead . Although its crossings were successful , the advance of the first battalion was executed only hesitantly ; the troops were surprised by German counterattacks and dispersed . The second battalion was likewise surprised with many men being taken prisoner . In the afternoon a French reconnaissance unit , the 5e Groupe de Reconnaissance de Division d 'Infanterie , with the assistance of another Dutch border battalion attempted an attack on the southern Moerdijk bridgehead , but the armoured cars of 6e Cuirassiers with which it was reinforced were heavily bombed by German Stukas and had to retreat . 
 In Rotterdam , though reinforced by an infantry regiment , the Dutch failed to completely dislodge the German airborne troops from their bridgehead on the northern bank of the Maas . Despite permission by General Kurt Student , the German commander in Rotterdam refused to evacuate this bridgehead and the few German defenders held fast in a single office building , protected by a canal in front of them and covered by fire from the south bank . The two remaining Dutch bombers failed to destroy the Willemsbrug . The German forces involved in the attack of the previous day on The Hague also held out , none of the attempts to eliminate the isolated groups of in total about 1600 paratroopers and airlanded forces met with success . 
 In North Brabant , the situation swiftly deteriorated . The French commanders of the 7th Army had expected that Dutch resistance at the Meuse and the Peel @-@ Raam Position , by a force about five divisions strong , would have gained them at least four days to build up a defensive line near Breda . They were unpleasantly surprised to learn that the best three divisions had been moved to the north and that the remaining forces were already in full retreat . The withdrawal of the Peel Division from the Peel @-@ Raam Position to the Zuid @-@ Willemsvaart , a canal some 10 to 30 kilometres ( 6 @.@ 2 to 18 @.@ 6 mi ) to the west , meant leaving behind their well @-@ entrenched positions and the little artillery available in exchange for a totally unprepared line . Moreover , the eastern bank of the canal was higher than the western bank , providing excellent cover for the attackers . Finally , the order to withdraw never reached the troops at Mill ; this caused one sector of the canal , near <unk> , to be left undefended ; as this sector contained a bridge which was not demolished , the Germans were effortlessly able to cross the canal around 13 : 00 . A second crossing at Erp , against opposition , led to a general collapse of the line . By the end of the 11th , the Germans had crossed the Zuid @-@ Willemsvaart at most places and the Peel Division had largely disintegrated . Plans by Colonel Schmidt to concentrate his forces on the line <unk> ' s @-@ Hertogenbosch thus came to nothing . As the French refused to advance further to the northeast than Tilburg , apart from some reconnoitering armoured cars that went as far as <unk> , this created a dangerous gap . Winkelman , sensitive to the general Dutch weakness in the region , requested the British government to send an Army Corps to reinforce allied positions in the area and bomb Waalhaven airfield . 
 All the efforts in the south were made on the assumption the Grebbe Line would be able to beat off attacks on its own ; its reserves had even been partly shifted to the counterattack against the airborne forces . However , there were some indications that a problem was developing in this sector . Motorised elements of SS Standarte " Der Fuehrer " , preceding 207 . Infanteriedivision , had reached the southernmost part of the Grebbe Line , in front of the Grebbeberg , on the evening of the 10th . This Main Defense Line sector had no inundations in front of it and had therefore been chosen as the main attack axis of the division . It was protected by a line of outposts ( <unk> ) , manned by two companies of infantry . At about half past three in the morning of the 11th , German artillery started shelling the outposts , followed at dawn by an attack by two battalions of Der Fuehrer . As the German shelling had cut the telephone lines , no artillery support could be requested by the Dutch defenders . Defence was further hampered by the fact that the terrain had not yet been cleared of vegetation , which offered good cover for the attackers . At noon a breakthrough was accomplished at the extreme north of the outpost line and the Dutch positions were then slowly rolled up from behind . The outnumbered and <unk> armed companies resisted as well as they could , but by evening , all outposts were in German hands . The commander of 2nd Army Corps , Major @-@ General Jacob <unk> , failed to react adequately . He did not realise that motorised SS troops had been involved in the attack , and thought that the outposts had been surrendered to a small probing German force through the cowardice of the defenders . He ordered a night counterattack by the single reserve battalion of 4th Division . This attack was abandoned ; on its approach the battalion was fired upon by Dutch troops manning the main line that had not been notified of its approach , leading to much confusion , and an engineer bridge necessary to cross the Grift rivulet failed to be brought forward in time . However , heavy preparatory Dutch artillery fire had the unintended effect of causing the Germans to abandon their plans for a night attack . 
 Meanwhile , in the North , 1 . Kavalleriedivision advanced through the province of Friesland towards the final Dutch fall @-@ back line , the <unk> , reaching <unk> in the evening . Most Dutch troops had been evacuated from the north over the Enclosure Dike . 
 = = = 12 May = = = 
 On the morning of 12 May General Winkelman remained moderately optimistic . He still assumed a firm defence line could eventually be established in North Brabant with the help of the French and expected good progress could be made in eliminating the airborne forces , while not being aware of any special danger to the Grebbe Line . During the day his hopes would be dashed . 
 In the two previous days , 9 . Panzerdivision had seen little action . It crossed the Meuse in the early morning of 11 May and during that day was unable to advance quickly over roads that were congested by supply trains of the infantry divisions . The armoured division was under orders to link up with the airborne troops as soon as the Peel @-@ Raam Position had been breached by the infantry forces . As the entire Dutch front had dissolved , the conditions were favourable for such an attempt . In this it would not be hindered by the French forces . Because the German 6th Army was threatening its right flank and there was no time to prepare a defence line , Gamelin ordered the 7th Army to withdraw its left flank . 2e Brigade Légère Mécanique , part of <unk> Division Légère Mécanique , that had arrived at Tilburg , retreated to the south . Also the 25e Division d 'Infanterie <unk> at Breda , progressed no further to the north than the river Mark . As the initial order to occupy the Geertruidenberg sector had not been followed upon , the route to the Moerdijk bridges would not be blocked and the German armoured division would not be engaged by its stronger French mechanised counterpart . The reconnaissance elements of the 9th Panzer Division effectively exploited this opportunity : at dawn they surprised north of Tilburg , near Loon op Zand , Colonel Schmidt and took him prisoner . The Dutch troops in the province hereby lost all unified command . Shortly after noon the German armoured cars had penetrated thirty kilometres more to the west and made contact with the southern Moerdijk bridgehead , cutting off the Fortress Holland from the Allied main force ; at 16 : 45 they had reached the bridges themselves . The northern part of that force would not long remain in the region : at 13 : 35 Gamelin ordered a complete withdrawal to Antwerp of all French troops in North @-@ Brabant , who would now limit themselves to rear @-@ guard actions . 
 The Light Division tried to systematically reconquer the Island of Dordrecht by advancing on a broad front , using four battalions with little artillery support . On its left flank , where there was almost no enemy presence , the advance went according to plan . The battalion on the right flank however , ran into an attacking German force of battalion strength that had been ordered by General Student to circle around the outskirts of the city to relieve the pressure being placed on his troops holding the Dort bridges . In confused street fighting the German troops were successful in blocking the battalion ; the other Dutch units then halted their advance around noon . Though higher command soon ordered a better concentration of forces instead of some mopping @-@ up action , due to a lack of clear lines of command , no subsequent attack materialised that day . 
 In Rotterdam and around The Hague again little was done against the paratroopers . Most Dutch commanders , still afraid of a presumed Fifth Column , limited themselves to security measures ; they had been ordered not to stage any attacks above company level . 
 While the situation in the south was becoming critical , in the east the Germans made a first successful effort in dislodging the Dutch defenders on the Grebbeberg . After preparatory artillery bombardment in the morning , at around noon a battalion of Der Fuehrer attacked an eight hundred metres wide sector of the main line , occupied by a Dutch company . Exploiting the many dead angles in the Dutch field of fire , it soon breached the Dutch positions , which had little depth . A second German battalion then expanded the breach to the north . Dutch artillery , though equal in strength to the German , failed to bring sufficient fire on the enemy concentration of infantry , largely limiting itself to interdiction . Eight hundred metres to the west was a Stop Line , a continuous trench system from which the defenders were supposed to wage an active defence , staging local counterattacks . However , due to a lack of numbers , training , and heavy weapons the attacks failed against the well @-@ trained SS troops . By the evening the Germans had brought the heavily forested area between the two lines under their control . Spotting a weak point , one of the SS battalion commanders , Obersturmbannführer Hilmar Wäckerle , suddenly attacked with a hastily assembled force of about company strength . In a , for this battle , rare instance of infiltration tactics he broke through the Stop Line , quickly advancing 1 @.@ 6 km ( 1 mi ) to the west until being halted by a fall @-@ back line along the Rhenen railroad . The breakthrough caused a panic among the defenders , who largely abandoned the Stop Line at this point ; but as Wäckerle had had no time to coordinate his action with other units , it was not further exploited . Order was restored at the Stop Line and the SS company became isolated and surrounded . The earlier general German advance later caused the main line to be abandoned for over 3 @.@ 2 km ( 2 mi ) to the north because the troops there feared an attack from behind . 
 It had been well understood by the Dutch that the forces occupying the Grebbe Line would not be sufficiently strong to repel all attacks by themselves ; they were intended to delay an offensive long enough for reserves to reinforce them . Due to the failure the previous day to understand that the German main assault was imminent however , these reserves would not arrive in time to intervene in the fight at the defence zone between the two trench systems . This was all the more serious as the Stop Line had no depth and lacked large shelters to accommodate enough troops to stage a strong frontal counterattack . In the late evening it was decided to execute a flank attack from the north the next day . 
 In the North , the <unk> Position formed a bridgehead at the eastern end of the Enclosure Dike ; it had a long perimeter of about nine kilometres to envelop enough land to receive a large number of retreating troops without making them too vulnerable to air attack . On 12 May units with a combined strength of only two battalions were still present , so the line was weakly held . This was exploited by the first German unit to arrive , the single bicycle battalion of 1 . Kavalleriedivision . At noon it quickly penetrated the line in a concentrated attack , forcing the defenders to withdraw to the Enclosure Dike . For some the German advance cut off their escape route by land ; they sailed away from the small port of <unk> , taking the last remaining vessels on the eastern side of Lake IJssel . This denied the Germans any craft for a crossing attempt , which plan was now abandoned . 
 In the afternoon General Winkelman received information about armoured forces advancing in the <unk> region , on the road between ' s @-@ Hertogenbosch and the Moerdijk bridges . He still fostered hopes that those forces were French , but the announcement by Radio Bremen at 23 : 00 that German tanks had linked up with the paratroopers ended those hopes . At last he began to understand the essence of the German strategy . He ordered the artillery batteries in the Hoekse Waard to try to destroy the Moerdijk bridges and sent a special engineering team to Rotterdam to blow up the Willemsbrug . Pessimistic about the general situation at this point , he also ordered the vast strategic oil reserves of Royal Dutch Shell at <unk> to be set on fire . Having been informed by Winkelman of his concerns earlier in the afternoon , the Dutch government asked Winston Churchill for three British divisions to turn the tide . The new prime minister answered that he simply did not have any reserves ; however , three British torpedo boats were sent to Lake IJssel . Also , 2nd Welsh Guard battalion was prepared to be sent to Hook of Holland though it would not arrive in time . 
 Contrary to Winkelman , the German command was very satisfied with the day 's events . It had been feared that the third day of the operation might become a " crisis day " , the XXVI Armeekorps having to overcome near Breda the resistance of several French divisions . The Germans had also been concerned that they may face some Belgian or even British divisions . Therefore , von Bock had before the invasion requested to be reinforced in this effort by another Army Corps . When this had been denied by chief of staff Franz Halder , he had arranged the formation of an extra Army Corps headquarters to direct the complex strategic situation of simultaneously fighting the Allies and advancing into the Fortress Holland over the Moerdijk bridges . As on 12 May no actual crisis seemed to materialise , with the French retreating and Belgian and British forces being completely absent , von Bock decided that XXVI Armeekorps would be responsible for pursuing the French south towards Antwerp , while some forces would be directed by the new headquarters , <unk> XXXIX under command of Generalleutnant Rudolf Schmidt , to advance north with 254 . Infanteriedivision , most of 9 . Panzerdivision , and SS Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler . 
 = = = 13 May = = = 
 In the early morning of 13 May General Winkelman advised the Dutch government that he considered the general situation to be critical . On land the Dutch had been cut off from the Allied front and it had become clear no major Allied landings were to be expected to reinforce the Fortress Holland by sea ; without such support there was no prospect of a prolonged successful resistance . German tanks might quickly pass through Rotterdam ; Winkelman had already ordered all available antitank @-@ guns to be placed in a perimeter around The Hague , to protect the seat of government . However , an immediate collapse of the Dutch defences might still be prevented if the planned counterattacks could seal off the southern front near Dordrecht and restore the eastern line at the Grebbeberg . Therefore , the cabinet decided to continue the fight for the time being , giving the general the mandate to surrender the Army when he saw fit and the instruction to avoid unnecessary sacrifices . Nevertheless , it was also deemed essential that Queen Wilhelmina was to be brought to safety ; she departed around noon from Hoek van Holland , where a British Irish Guards battalion was present , on HMS Hereward , a British destroyer , and when sea mines made it too dangerous to try to reach Zealand , she went to England . The previous evening , the Queen 's only child and heir presumptive Princess Juliana , together with her husband Prince Bernhard of Lippe @-@ Biesterfeld and their children , had departed from IJmuiden on HMS Codrington for Harwich . Arrangements for the departure had already been made before the invasion . As the Queen constitutionally was part of the government , her departure confronted the cabinet with the choice whether to follow her or remain . After heated discussions it was decided to leave also : the ministers sailed at 19 : 20 from Hoek van Holland on HMS Windsor to form a government in exile in London , having conferred all governmental authority over the homeland to Winkelman . Three Dutch merchant ships , escorted by British warships , transferred government bullion and diamond stocks to the United Kingdom . 
 While two tank companies of 9 . Panzerdivision remained with XXVI Armeekorps to pursue the withdrawing French , the other four began to cross the Moerdijk traffic bridge at 05 : 20 . Two staff companies with tanks also went to the northern side . The Dutch made some attempts to indirectly block the advance of the German armour . At around 06 : 00 the last operational medium bomber , a Fokker T. V , dropped two bombs on the bridge ; one hit a bridge pillar but failed to explode ; the bomber was shot down . Dutch batteries in the Hoekse Waard , despite dive bomber attacks , tried to destroy the bridge by artillery fire , but the massive structure was only slightly damaged . Attempts to inundate the Island of Dordrecht failed , as the inlet sluices could not be opened — and were too small anyway . 
 The Light Division tried to cut the German corridor by advancing to the west and linking up with a small ferry bridgehead over the <unk> Kil . However , two of the four battalions available were inefficiently deployed in a failed effort to recapture the suburbs of Dordrecht ; when the other two battalions approached the main road , they were met head on by a few dozen German tanks . The vanguard of the Dutch troops , not having been informed of their presence , mistook the red air recognition cloths strapped on top of the German armour for orange flags French vehicles might use to indicate their friendly intentions — orange being seen by the Dutch as their national colour — and ran towards the vehicles to welcome them , only understanding their error when they were gunned down . The battalions , subsequently hit by a Stuka bombardment , fled to the east ; a catastrophe was prevented by 47mm and 75 mm batteries halting with direct AP fire the assault of the German tanks . The left wing of the Light Division despite the heavy losses then completed an ordered withdrawal to the Alblasserwaard at around 13 : 00 . In the early afternoon eight tanks reduced the ferry bridgehead . A tank company also tried to capture the old inner city of Dordrecht without infantry support , audaciously breaching barricades , but was ordered to retreat after heavy street fighting in which at least two Panzerkampfwagen IIs were destroyed and three tanks heavily damaged . All Dutch troops were withdrawn from the island in the night . 
 German armoured forces advanced north over the Dordrecht bridge into IJsselmonde island . Three tanks , two PzKpfw . IIs and a Panzerkampfwagen III of the staff platoon of the 1st Tank Battalion , stormed the <unk> bridge into the Hoekse Waard , but all of them were lost to a single 47 mm antitank @-@ gun . Though the Germans did not follow up their attack , this area too was abandoned by the Dutch troops . 
 In Rotterdam a last attempt was made to blow up the Willemsbrug . The commander of the 2nd Battalion Irish Guards in Hoek van Holland , 32 km ( 20 mi ) to the west , refused to participate in the attempt as being outside the scope of his orders . Two Dutch companies , mainly composed of Dutch marines , stormed the bridgehead . The bridge was reached and the remaining fifty German defenders in the building in front of it were on the point of surrender when after hours of fighting the attack was abandoned because of heavy flanking fire from the other side of the river . 
 In the North , the commander of 1 . Kavalleriedivision , Major General Kurt Feldt , faced the unenviable task of having to advance over the Enclosure Dike because of a lack of ships . This dam was blocked by the Kornwerderzand Position , which protected a major sluice complex regulating the water level of Lake IJssel , which had to be sufficiently high to allow many Fortress Holland inundations to be maintained . The main fortifications contained 47 mm antitank @-@ guns . Long channel piers projected in front of and behind the sluices , on both the right and left ; on these pillboxes had been built which could place a heavy enfilading fire on the dam , which did not provide the slightest cover for any attacker . On 13 May the position was reinforced by a 20 mm anti aircraft battery . It had been Feldt 's intention to first destroy the position by a battery of siege mortars , but the train transporting it had been blocked on 10 May by a blown railway bridge at Winschoten . Several air attacks on 13 May had little effect ; in the late afternoon five bicycle sections tried to approach the main bunker complex under cover of an artillery bombardment , but soon fled after being fired upon ; the first was pinned down and could only retreat under cover of darkness , leaving behind some dead . 
 In the East the Germans tried to overcome the resistance in the Grebbe Line by also deploying the other division of X. AK , 227 . Infanteriedivision . It had to break through a second attack axis near <unk> , where a dry approach route had been discovered through the inundations . The line was in this area defended by the Dutch 2nd Infantry Division . Two German regiments were to attack simultaneously , in adjacent sectors . However , when the regiment on the right , 366 . Infanterieregiment , had already reached the start position for the attack , the regiment on the left , 412 . Infanterieregiment , became delayed by flanking fire from Dutch outposts , the position of which had not been correctly determined . It allowed itself to get involved in fragmented firefights ; though eventually also the reserve regiment was brought forward , little progress was made against the outpost line . Meanwhile , the waiting 366 . Infanterieregiment was pounded by concentrated Dutch artillery fire and had to withdraw , resulting in a complete failure of the attack by 227 Infanteriedivision . 
 On the extreme south of the Grebbe Line , the Grebbeberg , the Germans were now deploying three SS battalions including support troops and three fresh infantry battalions of <unk> ; two of <unk> laid in immediate reserve . During the evening and night of 12 – 13 May the Dutch had assembled in this sector about a dozen battalions . These forces consisted of the reserve battalions of several army corps , divisions and brigades , and the independent Brigade B , which had been freed when the Main Defence Line in the Land van Maas en Waal had been abandoned as part of the withdrawal of III Army Corps from North Brabant . However , not all of these units would be concentrated into a single effort for a counterattack to retake the main line . Some battalions had been fed immediately into the battle at the Stop Line and others were kept in reserve , mainly behind the fall @-@ back line near the Rhenen railroad . Furthermore , most battalions were a quarter below strength . Four were to be used , under command of Brigade B , for the flanking attack from the north . This attack was delayed for several hours ; when it finally started late in the morning of 13 May , it ran right into a comparable advance by two battalions of Der Fuehrer . This brigade , unaware of Dutch intentions , had shifted its attack axis to the north to roll up the Grebbe Line from behind . A confused encounter fight followed in which the vanguard of the Dutch troops , poorly supported by their artillery , began to give way at around 12 : 30 to the encroaching SS troops . Soon this resulted in a general withdrawal of the brigade , which turned into a rout when the Grebbeberg area was after 13 : 30 bombed by 27 Ju 87 Stukas . 
 Meanwhile , 207 . Infanteriedivision was for the first time committed to battle at the Grebbeberg itself when two battalions of its 322 . Infanterieregiment attacked the Stop Line . The first wave of German attackers was largely beaten off with serious losses , but a second wave managed to fragment the trench line , which then was taken after heavy fighting . The regiment subsequently proceeded to mop up the area to the west , delayed by resistance by several Dutch command posts . However , it withdrew in the late afternoon , just as the SS battalions further north , to avoid a preparatory artillery bombardment , shifted to a more western position . After redeployment the Germans intended to renew their attack in order to take the Rhenen fall @-@ back line and the village of Achterberg . However , these preparations would prove to be superfluous : the Dutch had already disappeared . 
 The same Stuka bombardment that made Brigade B rout also broke the morale of the reserves at Rhenen . In the morning these troops had already shown severe discipline problems , with units disintegrating and leaving the battlefield because of German interdiction fire . In the late afternoon most of 4th Infantry Division was fleeing westwards . The Germans had expected that the Dutch would attempt to plug any gaps in the line and indeed it had been planned to shift to the north two regiments of the Dutch 3rd Army Corps for this purpose . But Dutch command now suffered such a loss of control that any thoughts to re @-@ establish a continuous front had to be abandoned . A 8 km ( 5 @.@ 0 mi ) wide gap had appeared in the defences . Fearing that otherwise they would be encircled , at 20 : 30 Van Voorst tot Voorst ordered the three Army Corps to immediately abandon both the Grebbe Line and the Waal @-@ Linge Position and to retreat during the night to the East Front of Fortress Holland at the New Holland Water Line . The Germans however , did not at once exploit their success ; only around 21 : 00 had it become apparent to them that the gap even existed , when the renewed advance had met no enemy resistance . 
 = = = 14 May = = = 
 Despite his pessimism expressed to the Dutch government and the mandate he had been given to surrender the Army , General Winkelman awaited the outcome of events , avoiding actually capitulating until it was absolutely necessary . In this he was perhaps motivated by a desire to engage the opposing German troops for as long as possible , to assist the Allied war effort . In the early morning of 14 May , though the situation remained critical , a certain calm was evident in the Dutch Headquarters . 
 In the North , a German artillery bombardment of the Kornwerderzand Position began at 09 : 00 . However , the German batteries were forced to move away after being surprised by counterfire from the 15 <unk> aft cannon of Hr. Ms. Johan Maurits van Nassau that had sailed into the Wadden Sea . Feldt now decided to land on the coast of North @-@ Holland . A few barges were found ; only after the capitulation however , was the crossing actually executed . During this operation one barge foundered and the remainder lost their way . Fears for such a landing had caused Winkelman on 12 May to order the occupation of an improvised " Amsterdam Position " along the North Sea Canal , but only weak forces were available . 
 In the East , under cover of ground fog the field army successfully withdrew from the Grebbe Line to the East Front without being bombed as had been feared , and disengaged from the gradually pursuing enemy troops . The new position had some severe drawbacks : the inundations were mostly not yet ready and the earthworks and berms needed because trenches would be flooded in the peat soil had not yet been constructed , so defences had to be improvised to accommodate the much larger number of troops . 
 On IJsselmonde the German forces prepared to cross the Maas in Rotterdam , which was defended by about eight Dutch battalions . Crossings would be attempted in two sectors . The main attack would take place in the centre of the city , with the German 9th Panzer Division advancing over the Willemsbrug . Then SS Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler would cross to operate on its immediate left and east of Rotterdam a battalion of the 16th Infantry Regiment of 22 . <unk> would cross on boats . These auxiliary attacks might prevent a concentration of Dutch forces , blocking the 9th Panzer Division 's advance through a densely built up urban area intersected by canals . In view of these conditions and the limited means available , there was a major emphasis on air support . Already on 13 May , von Küchler , fearing that the British might reinforce the Fortress Holland , had instructed Schmidt : " Resistance in Rotterdam should be broken with all means , if necessary threaten with and carry out the annihilation [ <unk> ] of the city " . In this he was to be supported by the highest command level as Hitler would state in Führer @-@ Weisung Nr. 11 ( Führer @-@ Directive N ° 11 ) : " On the northern wing the power of the Army of Holland to resist has proven stronger than had been assumed . Political as well as military grounds demand to quickly break this resistance . ( ... ) Furthermore the speedy conquest of the Fortress Holland is to be facilitated through a deliberate weakening of the [ air ] power operated by Sixth Army " . Kampfgeschwader 54 , using Heinkel He 111 bombers , was therefore shifted from Sixth to Eighteenth Army . 
 Generals Kurt Student and Schmidt desired a limited air attack to temporarily paralyse the defences , allowing the tanks to break out of the bridgehead ; severe urban destruction was to be avoided as it would only hamper their advance . However , Luftwaffe commander Hermann Göring , worried about the fate of his surrounded airborne troops , hoped to force an immediate Dutch national capitulation by a much more extensive bombardment . His head of operations , General Otto Hoffmann von Waldau , described this option as a " radical solution " [ <unk> ] . Despite misgivings by Albert Kesselring about its scope and necessity , at 11 : 45 ninety Heinkels took off for a carpet bombing of the inner city of Rotterdam . 
 At 09 : 00 a German messenger crossed the Willemsbrug to bring an ultimatum from Schmidt to Colonel Pieter Scharroo , the Dutch commander of Rotterdam , demanding a capitulation of the city ; if a positive answer had not been received within two hours the " severest means of annihilation " would be employed . However , Scharroo did not receive the message until 10 : 30 . Not feeling inclined to surrender regardless , he asked Winkelman for orders ; the latter , hearing that the document had not been signed nor contained the name of the sender , instructed him to send a Dutch envoy to clarify matters and gain time . At 12 : 15 a Dutch captain handed this request to von Choltitz . On the return of the German envoy at 12 : 00 , Schmidt had already sent a radio message that the bombardment had to be postponed because negotiations had started . Just after the Dutch envoy had received a second ultimatum , now signed by Schmidt and with a new expiry time of 16 : 20 , around 13 : 20 two formations of Heinkels arrived , not having received any recall orders . This was later explained by the Germans as a result of their having already pulled in their tow aerials . Schmidt ordered red flares to be fired to signal that the bombardment was to be broken off , but only the squadron making the bomb run from the southwest abandoned its attack , after their first three planes had dropped their bombs . The other 54 Heinkels , having approached from the east , continued to drop their share of the grand total of 1308 bombs , destroying the inner city and killing 814 civilians . The ensuing fires destroyed about 24 @,@ 000 houses , making almost 80 @,@ 000 inhabitants homeless . At 15 : 50 Scharroo capitulated to Schmidt in person . Meanwhile , Göring had ordered a second bombardment of the city — a group of Heinkels had already left — to be carried out unless a message was received that the whole of Rotterdam was occupied . When Schmidt heard of the order , he hastily sent an uncoded message at 17 : 15 claiming the city was taken , although this had yet to take place . The bombers were recalled just in time . 
 = = The surrender of the Dutch Army = = 
 Winkelman at first intended to continue the fight , even though Rotterdam had capitulated and German forces from there might now advance into the heart of the Fortress Holland . The possibility of terror bombings was considered before the invasion and had not been seen as grounds for immediate capitulation ; provisions had been made for the continuation of effective government even after widespread urban destruction . The perimeter around The Hague might still ward off an armoured attack and the New Holland Water Line had some defensive capability ; though it could be attacked from behind , it would take the Germans some time to deploy their forces in the difficult polder landscape . However , he soon received a message from Colonel Cuno Eduard Willem baron van Voorst tot Voorst , the commander of the city of Utrecht , that the Germans demanded its surrender ; leaflets were dropped by propaganda planes announcing that only unconditional surrender could " spare it the fate of Warsaw " . Winkelman concluded that it apparently had become the German policy to devastate any city offering any resistance ; in view of his mandate to avoid unnecessary suffering and the hopelessness of the Dutch military position he decided to surrender . All higher @-@ level army units were informed at 16 : 50 by Telex of his decision and ordered to first destroy their weapons and then offer their surrender to the nearest German units . At 17 : 20 the German envoy in The Hague was informed . At around 19 : 00 Winkelman gave a radio speech informing the Dutch people . This was also how the German command became aware the Dutch had surrendered ; the Dutch troops had generally disengaged from the enemy and had not yet made contact . The Dutch surrender implied that in principle a cease @-@ fire should be observed by both parties . 
 Winkelman acted both in his capacity of commander of the Dutch Army and of highest executive power of the homeland . This created a somewhat ambiguous situation . On the morning of 14 May the commander of the Royal Dutch Navy , Vice @-@ Admiral Johannes <unk> , had left the country to continue the fight ; Dutch naval vessels were generally not included in the surrender . Eight ships and four unfinished hulks had already departed , some smaller vessels were sunk off , and nine others sailed for England in the evening of 14 May . The Hr. Ms. Johan Maurits van Nassau was sunk by German bombers while crossing . The commander of the main Dutch naval port of Den Helder , Rear @-@ Admiral Hoyte <unk> , concluded that his base , with a naval garrison of 10 @,@ 000 , its own air service , and extensive land defences , should continue to resist also . Only with some difficulty did Winkelman convince him to obey the surrender order . Large parts of the Dutch Army were also reluctant to believe or accept the surrender , especially those units that hardly had seen any fighting , such as 3rd and 4th Army Corps and Brigade A. 
 At 05 : 00 on 15 May a German messenger reached The Hague , inviting Winkelman to <unk> for a meeting with von Küchler to negotiate the articles of a written capitulation document . Both quickly agreed on most conditions , Winkelman declaring to have surrendered army , naval and air forces . When von Küchler demanded that pilots still fighting for the allies should be treated as francs @-@ <unk> — seen by the Germans as guerilla fighters outside the laws of war — Winkelman 's refusal made it clear to the Germans that only the armed forces in the homeland , with the exception of Zealand , would capitulate , not the country itself . On other points a swift agreement was reached and the document was signed at 10 : 15 . 
 = = The fighting in Zealand = = 
 The province of Zealand was exempt from the surrender ; fighting continued there in a common allied effort with French troops . The Dutch forces in the province comprised eight full battalions of army and naval troops . They were commanded by Rear @-@ Admiral Hendrik Jan van der Stad , who , being a naval officer , had been directly subordinated to Winkelman . The area was under naval command because of the predominance of the naval port of Flushing on the island of Walcheren which controlled the access to Antwerp via the Western Scheldt . The northern islands of the province were almost undefended apart from some platoons . The defence of Zeeuws @-@ Vlaanderen , the Dutch part of Flanders , was largely left to the Allies . The main Dutch army forces would be thus concentrated in Zuid @-@ Beveland , the peninsula east of Walcheren , to deny the enemy this approach route to Vlissingen . Zuid @-@ Beveland was connected to the coast of North Brabant by an isthmus ; at its eastern and most narrow end the Bath Position had been prepared , occupied by an infantry battalion ; this was mainly intended as a collecting line for possible Dutch troops retreating from the east . At its western end was the longer Zanddijk Position , occupied by three battalions . 
 After three French <unk> had arrived on 10 May , motorised units that would subsequently depart for North Brabant , from 11 May the area was reinforced by two French infantry divisions : the <unk> Division d 'Infanterie , a B @-@ class division , and the newly formed naval 68e Division d 'Infanterie . Part of their equipment was brought by ship through Flushing harbour . Most troops of these divisions would remain south of the Western Scheldt in Zeeuws @-@ Vlaanderen , where two of the eight Dutch battalions were also present , as were two border companies . Only two French regiments were sent to the northern bank . On 13 May the Dutch troops were placed under French operational command and 68e Division d 'Infanterie was transferred to the 7th Army . The cooperation between the two allies left much to be desired and was plagued by poor communications , misunderstandings and differences regarding strategy . The Dutch considered the Bath and Zanddijk Positions to be very defensible because of the open polder landscape and extensive inundations . However , the French commander General Pierre @-@ Servais Durand was not convinced of their value and positioned his troops at more conspicuous obstacles . On the evening of 13 May one regiment , the <unk> of 68e Division d 'Infanterie , occupied the Canal through Zuid @-@ Beveland and the other , the <unk> of 60 Division d 'Infanterie , took a position at the <unk> straights separating the island of Walcheren from Zuid @-@ Beveland , even though there was not sufficient time for adequate entrenchment . This prevented an effective concentration of Allied forces , allowing the Germans , despite a numerical inferiority , to defeat them piecemeal . 
 On 14 May the Germans had occupied almost all of North Brabant . SS @-@ Standarte Deutschland , quickly advancing to the Western Scheldt , reached the Bath Position . This cut off the retreat of <unk> Groupe de Reconnaissance de Division d 'Infanterie , which was subsequently destroyed defending Bergen @-@ op @-@ Zoom . The morale of the defenders of the Bath Position , already shaken by stories from Dutch troops fleeing to the west , was severely undermined by the news that Winkelman had surrendered ; many concluded that it was useless that Zealand kept resisting as the last remaining province . A first preparatory artillery bombardment on the position in the evening of 14 May caused the commanding officers to desert their troops , who then also fled . 
 In the morning of 15 May SS @-@ Standarte Deutschland approached the Zanddijk Position . A first attack around 08 : 00 on outposts of the northern sector was easily repulsed , as the Germans had to advance over a narrow dike through the inundations , despite supporting air strikes by dive bombers . However , the bombardment caused the battalions in the main positions to flee , and the entire line had to be abandoned around 14 : 00 despite the southern part being supported by the French torpedo boat L <unk> . 
 On 16 May SS @-@ Standarte Deutschland , several kilometres to the west of the Zanddijk Position , approached the Canal through Zuid @-@ Beveland , where the French <unk> Régiment d ’ Infanterie was present , only partly dug in and now reinforced by the three retreated Dutch battalions . An aerial bombardment that morning routed the defenders before the ground attack had even started ; the first German crossings around 11 : 00 led to a complete collapse .

 While the commanders of the remaining Dutch troops on South @-@ Beveland refused direct commands by their superior to threaten the German flank , on 17 May a night attack at 03 : 00 across the <unk> failed . The Germans now demanded the capitulation of the island ; when this was refused they bombed <unk> and Flushing . Middelburg , the province 's capital city , was heavily shelled by artillery , its inner city partially burning down . The heavy bombardment demoralised the largely French defenders and the Germans managed to establish a bridgehead around noon . The few Dutch troops present on Walcheren , about three companies , ceased their resistance . In the evening the encroaching Germans threatened to overrun the French forces that had fled into Flushing , but a gallant delaying action led by brigade @-@ general Marcel <unk> in person , in which he was killed , allowed most troops to be evacuated over the Western Scheldt . 
 After North @-@ Beveland had surrendered on 18 May , Zeeuws @-@ Vlaanderen was the last remaining unoccupied Dutch homeland territory .

 = Siward , Earl of Northumbria = 
 Siward or Sigurd ( / <unk> / or more recently / <unk> / ; Old English : <unk> ) was an important earl of 11th @-@ century northern England . The Old Norse nickname Digri and its Latin translation Grossus ( " the stout " ) are given to him by near @-@ contemporary texts . Siward was probably of Scandinavian origin , perhaps a relative of Earl Ulf , and emerged as a powerful regional strongman in England during the reign of Cnut ( " Canute the Great " , 1016 – 1035 ) . Cnut was a Scandinavian ruler who conquered England in the 1010s , and Siward was one of the many Scandinavians who came to England in the aftermath of that conquest . Siward subsequently rose to become sub @-@ ruler of most of northern England . From 1033 at the latest Siward was in control of southern Northumbria , that is , present @-@ day Yorkshire , governing as earl on Cnut 's behalf . 
 He entrenched his position in northern England by marrying Ælfflæd , the daughter of Ealdred , Earl of Bamburgh . After killing Ealdred 's successor Eadulf in 1041 , Siward gained control of all Northumbria . He exerted his power in support of Cnut 's successors , kings Harthacnut and Edward , assisting them with vital military aid and counsel . He probably gained control of the middle shires of Northampton and Huntingdon by the 1050s , and there is some evidence that he spread Northumbrian control into Cumberland . In the early 1050s Earl Siward turned against the Scottish ruler Mac Bethad mac Findlaích ( " Macbeth " ) . Despite the death of his son Osbjorn , Siward defeated Mac Bethad in battle in 1054 . More than half a millennium later the Scotland adventure earned him a place in William Shakespeare 's Macbeth . Siward died in 1055 , leaving one son , Waltheof , who would eventually succeed to Northumbria . St Olave 's church in York and nearby Heslington Hill are associated with Siward . 
 = = Background = = 
 Siward 's career in northern England spanned the reigns of four different monarchs . It began during the reign of Cnut , and lasted through those of Harold Harefoot and Harthacnut into the early years of Edward the Confessor . Most important was the reign of Cnut , in which so many new political figures rose to power that some historians think it comparable to the Norman conquest five decades later . These " new men " were military figures , usually with weak hereditary links to the West Saxon royal house that Cnut had deposed . As Cnut ruled several Scandinavian kingdoms in addition to England , power at the highest level was delegated to such strongmen . In England , it fell to a handful of newly promoted " ealdormen " or " earls " , who ruled a shire or group of shires on behalf of the king . Siward was , in the words of historian Robin Fleming , " the third man in Cnut 's new triumvirate of earls " , the other two being Godwine , Earl of Wessex and Leofwine , Earl of Mercia . 
 Northern England in the 11th @-@ century was a region quite distinct from the rest of the country . The former kingdom of Northumbria stretched from the Humber and Mersey estuaries , northward to the Firth of Forth , where , passing the western Kingdom of Strathclyde , it met the Kingdom of Alba ( Scotland ) . Northumbria had been united with the West Saxon English kingdom only in the 950s , by King Eadred , and subsequent control was exerted through the agency of at least two ealdormen , one to the north and one to the south of the River Tees . The former is associated with the stronghold of Bamburgh , while the latter is associated with the great Roman city of York . It was a politically fragmented region . The western part , from Lancashire to Cumberland , was heavily settled by Norse @-@ Gaels , while in the rest of Northumbria English and Anglo @-@ Scandinavian regional magnates — thegns , holds and high @-@ reeves — exercised a considerable degree of independence from the ealdormen . One such example was the magnate Thurbrand , a hold in Yorkshire , probably based in Holderness , whose family were frequently at odds with the ruling earls at Bamburgh . 
 = = Ancestry = = 
 Historians generally claim Siward to be of Scandinavian origin , a conclusion supported by the Vita <unk> Regis , which states that Siward was " [ called ] Digri in the Danish tongue " ( Danica lingua <unk> ) . Legendary material incorporated in the Vita et <unk> Waldevi <unk> ( or simply Vita Waldevi ) , the hagiographic biography of Siward 's son Waltheof , states that Siward was the son of a Scandinavian earl named Bjorn and provides a genealogy claiming that he was the descendant of a polar bear , a commonplace piece of Germanic folklore . 
 Historian Timothy Bolton has recently argued that the similarities between these genealogies is evidence of a shared family tradition between the descendants of Siward and Thorgil Sprakling . Bolton hypothesized that Siward 's alleged father Bjorn was probably a historical figure , a brother of Thorgil Sprakling . Siward would then have been first cousin to Earl Ulf , the earl of Denmark who married Cnut 's sister <unk> and founded the dynasty of Danish monarchs that eventually succeeded Cnut 's . Bolton argued that the Sprakling family had only recently risen to prominence in Scandinavia , and so Siward 's career in England was another indication of that family 's success in Scandinavian politics . 
 The Vita Waldevi provides further legendary detail of Siward 's journey from Scandinavia to England . According to the Vita , Siward passed through Orkney , killing a dragon there before moving on to Northumbria . There he encountered another dragon , before meeting an Oðinn @-@ like old man on a hill , who handed him a raven banner and instructed him to proceed to London to receive the patronage of the king of England . 
 = = Career under Cnut , Harold and Harthacnut = = 
 The exact date and context of Siward 's arrival in England are unknown , though the Vita Waldevi offers a legendary account . Charters dating to 1019 , 1024 , 1032 , 1033 and 1035 mention a Si [ ge ] ward Minister , " the thegn Siward " , but it is impossible to securely identify any of these names with the man who became Earl of Northumbria . The earliest certain contemporary record of Siward occurs in a charter of King Cnut to Ælfric Puttoc , Archbishop of York , in 1033 . This charter attestation can be identified as Siward the earl because he is styled dux ( " earl " ) . 
 Although it is clear that Siward was earl by 1033 , he may have attained the position somewhat earlier . His predecessor Erik of <unk> last appeared in the historical sources in 1023 , leaving a ten @-@ year gap during which Siward could have taken the position . Although William of Malmesbury asserted that Erik was driven back to Scandinavia , Scandinavian tradition firmly maintained he died in England . Historian William Kapelle believed that Erik ceased to be earl in or soon after 1023 , and that Carl son of Thurbrand was appointed hold or high @-@ reeve ( <unk> ) for the king in Yorkshire . Carl retained this position , it was argued , even after Siward was installed as earl a few years later , but from then on he acted as a deputy to the earl rather than to the king . Richard Fletcher remained agnostic on the point , although he did argue that Erik must have been dead by 1028 . Timothy Bolton , although rejecting Kapelle 's argument concerning Carl son of Thurbrand , believed Erik died c . 1023 and that the earldom may have remained vacant for a period . Bolton argued that Cnut left the earldom of Northumbria empty and appears to have paid it little attention until the last years of his reign , and another northerner Ealdred son of Uhtred rose to power in the political vacuum . 
 When Cnut died in 1035 , there were a number of rival claimants for his throne . These included his son Harthacnut , and the nobleman Harold Harefoot , as well as Alfred Ætheling and Edward ( later , King Edward the Confessor ) , the exiled sons of Æthelred the Unready . Isolated in Scandinavia , Harthacnut was unable to prevent Harold Harefoot seizing the crown for himself . Ruling England from 1035 , Harold died in 1040 just as Harthacnut was preparing an invasion . Arriving soon after Harold 's death , Harthacnut reigned in England only two years before his own death in 1042 , a death that led to the peaceful succession of Edward . Frank Barlow speculated on Siward 's political stance , guessing that during these upheavals Siward assumed " a position of benevolent or prudent neutrality " . 
 Siward is found in 1038 , as <unk> Comes ( " Earl Siward " ) , witnessing a charter of King Harthacnut to the Abbey of Bury St Edmunds . He witnessed a confirmation granted by Harthacnut to Fécamp Abbey , between 1040 and 1042 , of an earlier grant made by Cnut . In 1042 , he witnessed grants by Harthacnut to Abingdon Abbey and to Ælfwine , Bishop of Winchester . 
 Siward was , at some stage , married to Ælfflæd , daughter of Ealdred II of Bamburgh , and granddaughter of Uhtred the Bold . The Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle asserts that , in 1041 Eadulf , Earl of Bamburgh , was " betrayed " by King Harthacnut . The " betrayal " seems to have been carried out by Siward ; since when the Libellus de Exordio and other sources write about the same event , they say that Siward attacked and killed Eadulf . It was thus that Siward became earl of all Northumbria , perhaps the first person to do so since Uhtred the Bold . It is possible that Siward used Ælfflæd 's lineage to claim the earldom of Bamburgh for himself , although it is unclear whether the marriage took place before or after Siward killed Eadulf . Kapelle has pointed out that no ruler of Bamburgh after Uhtred is attested at the English royal court , which he argued " must mean they were in revolt " against the monarchy , and that Siward 's attack may therefore have been encouraged by a monarch wishing to crush a rebellious or disloyal vassal . Siward however probably had his own interests too . Killing Eadulf eliminated his main rival in the north , and the marriage associated him with the family of Uhtred the Bold , and with Uhtred 's surviving son Gospatric . 
 There may nonetheless be a connection between the murder of Eadulf and events further south . For the same year the Chronicle of John of Worcester related that , because of an attack on two of Harthacnut 's tax @-@ collectors there , Siward took part in a reprisal on the city and monastery of Worcester . Harthacnut reigned only another year , dying on 8 June 1042 . He was succeeded by the exiled English ætheling Edward . As an ætheling , a royal prince with a present or likely future claim on the throne , Edward appears to have been invited back by Harthacnut in 1041 , fortuitously smoothing over the coming change in ruler . Edward was crowned king on Easter Day , 3 April 1043 . 
 = = English affairs under Edward the Confessor = = 
 Relations between Siward and King Edward appear to have been good . Neither Siward nor any associates of Siward were punished by Edward in later years . In fact , Siward appears to have been one of Edward 's most powerful supporters . On 16 November 1043 , Siward , along with Earls Godwine of Wessex and Leofric of Mercia , marched with King Edward against Queen Emma , helping the king to deprive the queen of her huge treasury . Edward then accused Emma of treason and deposed Stigand , Bishop of Elmham from his position " because he was closest to his mother 's counsel " . 
 The Norman propagandist and historian , William of Poitiers , claimed that Siward was among those who had sworn an oath to uphold Edward the Confessor 's alleged declaration that William , Duke of Normandy ( later King William I ) , was to be his heir . Others said to have made that oath were Earls Godwine of Wessex and Leofric of Mercia , along with Stigand , who had been pardoned in 1044 , and raised to Bishop of Winchester in 1047 . If this did happen , it was probably during or a little before spring 1051 , when Robert , Archbishop of Canterbury , was journeying to Rome for his pallium . 
 In 1051 Siward , along with Earls Leofric and Ralph the Timid , mobilised forces in defence of the king against a rebellion by Earl Godwine and his sons . The Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle relates that although Siward had to call up reinforcements , King Edward was successful and Earl Godwine was temporarily exiled . Earl Godwine remained a threat in exile , and the continued " belligerent support " of Siward and Leofric was thus vital to King Edward 's safety . It was apparently , however , the reluctance of these two earls to fight Earl Godwine that contributed to Godwine 's re @-@ establishment in England in 1052 . 
 There is evidence to suggest that Siward extended his power southward , bringing the shire of Northampton into his control in the 1040s and the shire of Huntingdon in the 1050s . The evidence comes from royal writs addressed to Siward as earl in these shires . Siward 's predecessors as earl in these areas were other Scandinavians , <unk> and Bjorn son of Earl Ulf ; the former was styled " earl of the Midlanders " ( comes <unk> ) , showing that this earldom represented the earlier polity of the Middle Angles of Mercia . It was this area , rather than Northumbria , to which Siward 's descendants were most attached . 
 Likewise , it has been argued that Siward brought Cumberland , thought by some historians to have been lost to Strathclyde , back under Northumbrian lordship . The evidence comes from a document known to historians as " Gospatric 's Writ " . This is a written instruction , issued either by the future Gospatric , Earl of Northumbria or Gospatric , son of Earl Uhtred ) that was addressed to all Gospatric 's kindred and to the notables dwelling in the " all the lands that were Cumbrian " ( on <unk> þam <unk> <unk> <unk> ) ; it ordered that one Thorfinn mac Thore be free in all things ( þ <unk> mac Thore beo swa <unk> in <unk> <unk> ) in Allerdale , and that no man is to break the peace which was given by Gospatric and Earl Siward . Historians such as Charles <unk> @-@ Adams believed that such phraseology indicated that Siward conquered the region from its previous rulers , although others , like William Kapelle , believed that the region had come , were it ever lost , back into English power before Siward 's time . 
 A little can be said about Siward 's relations with the Northumbrian church , in particular with regard to his relations with Durham . As a result of Siward 's marriage to Ælfflæd , Siward gained possession of a group of estates in Teesside claimed by the bishops of Durham . Acquisition of these estates might have brought opposition from the Bishop of Durham , but Æthelric the incumbent had been expelled by the clergy of Durham in either 1045 or 1046 and , according to the Libellus de Exordio , only returned by bribing Siward . According to the Libellus , the clergy were " terrified and overwhelmed by the fearful power of the earl " and " were compelled willy nilly to be reconciled to the bishop , and to admit him into his episcopal see " . Despite this , Siward escaped censure in the writings of later Durham monks , something which suggests relations between Siward and Durham were probably good in general . 
 Siward can be found witnessing numerous charters during Edward 's reign , though not as many as the <unk> ; Siward usually comes third in lists of earls , behind Godwine and Leofric but ahead of Godwine 's sons and the other earls . He witnessed at least seven , possibly nine , extant charters in 1044 , six or seven in 1045 , two in 1046 , one in 1048 and one in 1049 . A Dux ( " earl " ) named <unk> and <unk> witnessed two charters in 1050 , and this may be Siward . There is another attestation in 1050 , and his name appears in two dubious witness lists attached to charters dating to 1052 and 1054 . Possibly Siward 's last historical appearance in English legal documents is in the agreement made — probably at Lincoln — between <unk> , Bishop of Dorchester , and Earl Leofric , dating to between 1053 and 1055 . 
 = = Expedition against the Scots = = 
 Siward is perhaps most famous for his expedition in 1054 against Macbeth , King of Scotland , an expedition that cost Siward his eldest son , Osbjorn . The origin of Siward 's conflict with the Scots is unclear . According to the Libellus de Exordio , in 1039 or 1040 , the Scottish king Donnchad mac Crínáin attacked northern Northumbria and besieged Durham . Within a year , Mac Bethad had deposed and killed Donnchad . The failed siege occurred a year before Siward attacked and killed Earl Eadulf of Bamburgh , and though no connection between the two events is clear it is likely that they were linked . 
 The Annals of Lindisfarne and Durham , written in the early 12th @-@ century , relate under the year 1046 that " Earl Siward with a great army came to Scotland , and expelled king Mac Bethad , and appointed another ; but after his departure Mac Bethad recovered his kingdom " . Historian William Kapelle thought that this was a genuine event of the 1040s , related to the Annals of Tigernach entry for 1045 that reported a " battle between the Scots " which led to the death of Crínán of Dunkeld , Donnchad 's father ; Kapelle thought that Siward had tried to place Crínán 's son and Donnchad 's brother <unk> on the Scottish throne . Another historian , Alex Woolf , argued that the Annals of Lindisfarne and Durham entry was probably referring to the invasion of Siward in 1054 , but misplaced under 1046 . 
 During the invasion of 1054 , a battle was fought somewhere in Scotland north of the Firth of Forth , a battle known variously as the " Battle of the Seven Sleepers " or the " Battle of Dunsinane " . The tradition that the battle actually took place at Dunsinane has its origins in later medieval legend . The earliest mention of Dunsinane as the location of the battle is in the early 15th @-@ century by Andrew of Wyntoun . 
 The earliest contemporary English account of the battle is found in the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle , recension D : 
 John of Worcester , using a related version of the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle , adds that Normans named Osbern Pentecost and Hugh , who had joined Mac Bethad earlier after fleeing from England , were killed in the battle . The battle is mentioned in the Irish annals too , briefly in the Annals of Tigernach and more extensively in the Annals of Ulster : 
 <unk> is unidentified , but may have been a relation of Mac Bethad 's enemy Crínán of Dunkeld , on the basis that some of Crínán 's descendants may have borne this name . 
 The purpose of Siward 's invasion is unclear , but it may be related to the identity of the " Máel Coluim " ( Malcolm ) mentioned in the sources . The early 12th @-@ century chronicle attributed to John of Worcester , probably using an earlier source , wrote that Siward defeated Mac Bethad and made " Máel Coluim , son of the king of the Cumbrians " a king ( <unk> , regis <unk> <unk> , ut rex <unk> , <unk> <unk> ) The identity of Máel Coluim and the reasons for Siward 's help are controversial . The traditional historical interpretation was that " Máel Coluim " is Máel Coluim mac Donnchada , known sometimes today as Malcolm III or Malcolm Canmore , and that Siward was attempting to oust Mac Bethad in his favour . 
 The traditional historical interpretation that " Máel Coluim " is Máel Coluim mac Donnchada derives from the Chronicle attributed to the 14th @-@ century chronicler of Scotland , John of Fordun , as well as from earlier sources such as William of Malmesbury . The latter reported that Mac Bethad was killed in the battle by Siward , but it is known that Mac Bethad outlived Siward by two years . A. A. M. Duncan argued in 2002 that , using the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle entry as their source , later writers innocently misidentified Máel Coluim " son of the king of the Cumbrians " with the later Scottish king of the same name . Duncan 's argument has been supported by several subsequent historians specialising in the era , such as Richard Oram , Dauvit Broun and Alex Woolf . It has also been suggested that Máel Coluim may have been a son of the Strathclyde British king Owen the Bald , perhaps by a daughter of Máel Coluim II , King of Scotland . 
 Duncan in fact believes that the Battle of the Seven Sleepers did not lead directly to a change of leadership in the Kingdom of Scotland . It has been suggested that the chief consequence of Siward 's expedition was not the overthrow of Mac Bethad , but the transfer of British territory — perhaps previously lying under Scottish suzerainty — to Northumbrian overlordship . Alex Woolf has posited that , in such a context , Máel Coluim might have been a discontented Cumbrian prince who had been forced to " put himself under English protection " . Evidence for Northumbrian control of Strathclyde in this period includes 11th @-@ century Northumbrian masonry found at the site of Glasgow Cathedral as well as early 12th @-@ century claims from the archbishopric of York that Archbishop Cynesige ( 1051 – 1060 ) had consecrated two Bishops of Glasgow . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 The 12th @-@ century historian , Henry of Huntingdon , in his Historia Anglorum , relates that when Siward was attacked by dysentery , fearing to die " like a cow " and wishing rather to die like a soldier , he clothed himself in armour and took to hand an axe and shield . <unk> in such a manner , Siward died . This anecdote is of doubtful historicity , and is thought to be derived from the saga devoted to Earl Siward , now lost . The Vita <unk> Regis states that Siward died at York and was buried in " the monastery of St Olaf " at <unk> , a claim confirmed by the Anglo @-@ Saxon Chronicle , John of Worcester , and the Historia Regum . 
 Material incorporated in two surviving sources is thought by some to attest to the existence of a lost saga or some other kind of literary tradition concerning Siward 's life . The first source is the Vita et Passio Waldevi , a hagiographic history of Siward 's cult @-@ inspiring son Waltheof . This text contains an account of Waltheof 's paternal origin , and in the process recounts certain adventures of his father Siward ( see boxes throughout article ) . The second major witness of the tradition is Henry of Huntingdon 's Historia Anglorum , which contains extracts of saga @-@ like material relating to Siward 's invasion of Scotland ( 1054 ) and his death ( 1055 ) . The Anglo @-@ Saxonist Frank Stenton declared that Siward was " not a statesman , but a Danish warrior of the primitive type " . Writers in the half @-@ century after his death remembered Siward as a strong ruler who brought peace and suppressed brigandage . 
 Siward died more than a decade before the death of Edward the Confessor , but despite this the Domesday Book recorded 4 manors , 3 in Yorkshire and 1 in Derbyshire , owned directly by Earl Siward in 1066 , all of them subsequently held by Hugh d 'Avranches , Earl of Chester . This land was stated to have been worth £ 212 , while his son Waltheof was said to have held £ 136 worth of land across 9 counties . Domesday records give an incomplete picture of Siward 's holdings . In total it recorded property worth £ 348 for Siward and his son , which on its own would compare poorly with the £ <unk> in value recorded to have been held by the family of the earls of Mercia . Of the latter , however , Morcar of Mercia , Earl of Northumbria on the day of King Edward 's death , possessed land worth £ 968 , while Tostig , exiled earl at the time , had land worth £ 491 ; both may have come into possession of some of Siward 's land in the course of becoming Earls of Northumbria . Moreover , the counties that would become Durham , Northumberland , Cumberland and Westmorland were largely omitted from the survey , while , besides being only very poorly documented , the lands in Yorkshire had been severely devastated and devalued during the Harrying of the North . 
 Siward is said to have built a church dedicated to St Olaf at <unk> , York . The record of his burial in this church is the only notice of a non @-@ royal lay burial inside a church in pre @-@ Norman England . Siward 's Howe , i.e. , Heslington Hill near York , was most likely named after Earl Siward , although probably because Siward held popular courts there rather than because it was his burial place . 
 One of Siward 's sons is known to have survived him , Waltheof , whose mother was Ælfflæd . Waltheof later rose to be an earl in the East Midlands before becoming Earl of Northumbria . When Waltheof rebelled against William the Conqueror , however , the act led to his execution and to his subsequent veneration as a saint at Crowland Abbey . Waltheof 's daughter married David I , King of the Scots , and through this connection Siward became one of the many ancestors of the later Scottish and British monarchs . 
 Besides Ælfflæd , Siward is known to have been married to a woman named <unk> , who died before Siward . The marriage is known from a grant she made of territory around Stamford , Lincolnshire , to Peterborough Abbey . Although no surviving children are attested , and no source states the name of Osbjorn 's mother , this marriage has nonetheless raised the possibility that Waltheof and Osbjorn were born to different mothers , and William Kapelle suggested that Siward may have originally intended Osbjorn to inherit his southern territories while Waltheof inherited those territories in the north associated with the family of his mother Ælfflæd . 
 = Ursula and Sabina Eriksson = 
 Ursula and Sabina Eriksson ( born 1967 ) are Swedish twin sisters who came to national attention in the United Kingdom in May 2008 after an apparent episode of folie à deux ( or " shared psychosis " ) , a rare psychiatric disorder in which delusional beliefs are transmitted from one individual to another , which resulted in a series of bizarre incidents on the M6 motorway and the subsequent killing of Glenn Hollinshead of Fenton , Staffordshire . There was no evidence that drugs or alcohol were involved in the incidents on the M6 or the death of Hollinshead . 
 The twins had been in Ireland before travelling to England and boarding a coach for London at Liverpool . Their odd behaviour after exiting the coach at a service station on the M6 – including not allowing the bags they were clutching to be searched – caused the driver not to allow them back on the coach . The two were later seen on the central reservation of the M6 . When Highways Agency Traffic Officers arrived to assist the women , they ran across the busy motorway . Ursula managed to dodge traffic - Sabina was first struck by a SEAT Leon . 
 Shortly after police arrived , the women again ran onto the motorway and were struck by oncoming vehicles , a Volkswagen Polo hitting Sabina and a Mercedes @-@ Benz <unk> lorry crushing Ursula 's legs . Sabina suffered a serious head injury that left her unconscious for several minutes . When Sabina regained consciousness , she refused medical aid and attacked a police officer , at which point she was arrested . Appearing calm , although a bit " odd " , as she was processed by police in Stoke @-@ on @-@ Trent , she was therefore released from custody . Shortly afterward she was taken in by Hollinshead , whom she later stabbed to death in an unprovoked attack . She was pursued running from the scene and arrested in hospital after jumping from a bridge onto a busy trunk road , later pleading guilty to manslaughter with diminished responsibility . She was sentenced to five years imprisonment and released on parole in 2011 .

 In Liverpool , at 8 : 30am on 17 May , Saturday , the twins went into St Anne Street Police Station to report concerns over Sabina 's children . At midday the pair boarded a National Express coach to London . A police report stated that the twins suddenly disembarked from the coach at Keele services , a motorway service station , as they were not feeling well . The driver of the coach , however , said he left them at Keele services after becoming suspicious of their behaviour . He noticed the twins clinging tightly to their bags and did not let them re @-@ board because they refused to let him search their bags for illegal items . The manager of the service station was informed and , also feeling suspicious of the pair , called the police . Officers arrived to talk to them but left after deeming the women harmless .

 The pair began to walk down the central reservation of the M6 motorway before attempting to cross the motorway , causing chaos to the traffic and picking up minor injuries in the attempt . Their elder brother claimed in a Swedish newspaper that his sisters were fleeing from maniacs who were chasing them . As seen on closed @-@ circuit television cameras , the police arrived to investigate and paramedics were also at the scene to treat the women . Along with the police came a small television crew who happened to be filming Motorway Cops with one of the officers . Sabina later told an officer at the police station , " We say in Sweden that an accident rarely comes alone . Usually at least one more follows – maybe two . " 
 Standing on the north direction hard shoulder of the motorway , just north of Three Mile Lane ( 52 ° 59 ' 38 @.@ 84 " N , 2 ° 18 ' 15 @.@ 44 " W ) , the police spoke to the twins when , without warning , Ursula ran into the side of an oncoming Mercedes @-@ Benz <unk> <unk> articulated lorry travelling at around 56 mph . Sabina then followed her into the road and was hit by a Volkswagen Polo travelling at high speed ; both survived . Ursula was immobilised as the lorry had crushed her legs . Sabina spent fifteen minutes unconscious . 
 The pair were treated by paramedics ; however both women resisted medical aid , fighting and screaming at the paramedics and police officers . Sabina shouted " They 're going to steal your organs " and Ursula told the policemen restraining her " I recognise you – I know you 're not real " . 
 Sabina got to her feet , whereupon a policewoman attempted to persuade her to stay on the ground and receive further medical attention . Sabina instead struck the officer and crossed the central reservation again , running into traffic on the other side of the motorway . Emergency workers and several members of the public caught up with her , restrained her and carried her to a waiting ambulance , at which point she was sedated . Ursula was also taken to hospital where she stayed for weeks . Sabina appeared less deranged and more calm and relaxed in police custody .

Leaving court she began to wander the streets of Stoke @-@ on @-@ Trent , seemingly attempting to reach her sister in hospital , carrying her possessions in a clear plastic bag given to her by police .

Sabina appeared friendly and stroked the dog as the three people struck up a conversation . Although friendly , Sabina appeared to be behaving oddly and this odd behaviour worried Molloy . Sabina asked the two men for directions to any nearby bed and breakfasts or hotels . Hollinshead took pity upon her and instead offered to take her back to his house at Duke Street , Fenton . Sabina accepted the offer and the three walked to the house , as Sabina told the men how she was trying to locate her hospitalised sister . 
 Back at the house her odd behaviour continued ; most notably she offered the men cigarettes , only to quickly snatch them out of their mouths as the men smoked them , claiming the cigarettes to be poisoned . She was also carrying multiple mobile phones , as well as a laptop . She appeared to be paranoid and constantly looked out of the windows ; this behaviour caused Molloy to assume that she had run away from an abusive partner . Shortly before midnight Molloy left the two , and Sabina stayed the night in Hollinshead 's home . 
 The next day , 20 May , Hollinshead called the local hospitals in order to locate Sabina 's sister Ursula . At 19 : 40 , Hollinshead came outside of the house to ask a neighbour , Frank Booth , for tea bags . Frank said he would get the tea bags once he had finished washing his vehicle , and Hollinshead went back to his home . One minute after returning inside he staggered back outside to the neighbour and told him " she stabbed me " , before collapsing to the ground . Sabina had stabbed him five times with a kitchen knife and Hollinshead died from his injuries . Sabina fled the premises and the neighbour dialled 999 .

 Sabina ran out of the house with a hammer , periodically hitting herself over the head with it . A passing motorist , Joshua <unk> , saw this extraordinary behaviour and decided to tackle her in an attempt to take control of the hammer . While wrestling with <unk> , Sabina took a roof tile out of her pocket and struck him on the back of the head with it , stunning him temporarily . 
 By this time paramedics had found her and gave chase . The pursuit was ended at Heron Cross when Sabina jumped from a 12 metre ( 40 ft ) high bridge onto the A50 . Having broken bones in the fall , she was taken to hospital . On 6 June 2008 she was arrested while recovering at University Hospital of North Staffordshire , and was later discharged from hospital on 11 September , at which point she was charged with murder . 
 Garry Hollinshead , brother of the man killed by Sabina , was critical of the justice system which he viewed as enabling Sabina to kill his brother . 
 " We don 't hold her responsible , the same as we wouldn 't blame a rabid dog for biting someone . She is ill and to a large degree , not responsible for her actions . But her mental disorder should have been recognized much earlier . " 
 " I do question the criminal justice system for allowing somebody like this to be let out when she is capable of committing such a crime . Her mental condition should have been properly assessed after what she did on the motorway and the experiences the police had . Her mental disorder should have been picked up prior to her being let out in to the community ... [ Glenn ] saw Eriksson in distress and was just trying to help . He wasn 't slow in coming forward to help somebody in distress . It was in his nature . He was trying to help . He would help anybody . If he saw a fight in the street and a guy was losing he would help . "

 Sabina Eriksson was charged with murder on 11 September 2008 , the same day she was discharged from hospital in a wheelchair . The trial was scheduled for February 2009 , but was adjourned after the court encountered difficulties in obtaining her medical records from Sweden . The trial was then scheduled to start on 1 September 2009 . 
 Sabina Eriksson pleaded guilty to manslaughter with diminished responsibility on 2 September 2009 . At no point during her interrogation or during the trial did she explain her actions , only replying " no comment " to extensive police questioning . Both the prosecution and defence claimed that Sabina was insane at the time of the killing , although she was sane at the time of her trial . The defence counsel in the trial claimed that Eriksson was a " secondary " sufferer of folie à deux , influenced by the presence or perceived presence of her twin sister – the " primary " sufferer . The court also heard that she had suffered from a rare psychiatric disorder which made her hear voices , but could not interpret what they said , as well as an alternative theory that she had suffered from acute polymorphic delusional disorder . 
 The plea of manslaughter on the grounds of diminished responsibility was accepted at Nottingham Crown Court on 2 September 2010 . Sabina was sentenced to five years in prison . Having already spent 439 days in custody before sentencing , this left her first eligible for release in 2011 . In prison she turned to Christianity . 
 Justice Saunders concluded that Sabina had a " low " level of culpability for her actions . 
 I understand that this sentence will seem entirely inadequate to the relatives of the deceased . However , I have sentenced on the basis that the reason for the killing was the mental illness and therefore the culpability of the defendant is low and therefore the sentence I have passed is designed to protect the public . It is not designed to reflect the grief the relatives have suffered or to measure the value of Mr Hollinshead 's life . No sentence that I could pass could do that . It is a sentence which I hope fairly measures a truly tragic event . 
 Justice Saunders also said that : 
 [ Sabina was ] suffering from delusions which she believed to be true and they dictated her behaviour . It is not one of those cases where the defendant could have done something to avoid the onset .

 Many questions were left unanswered , and Detective Superintendent Dave Garrett stated that " the reasons for the two events may never be truly known or understood but the taking of Glenn 's life was a violent and senseless act " . 
 Some called for an investigation into the way the criminal justice system handled the matter , including Peter Molloy and MP for Stoke South Robert <unk> .

 Madness in the Fast Lane is the BBC documentary , first broadcast on BBC One on 10 August 2010 , which brought the story of Sabina and Ursula Eriksson and the killing of Glen Hollinshead into the public consciousness . The footage on the M6 motorway of the two women jumping into the passing traffic had previously been broadcast on Motorway Cops , but this was the first time the rest of the story had been told .
