 = = = Critical response = = = 
 Critics responded positively to the film , in particular to Craig 's performance and credibility . During production , Craig had been subject to debate by the media and the public , as he did not appear to fit Ian Fleming 's original portrait of the character as tall , dark and suave . The Daily Telegraph compared the quality of Craig 's characterisation of Bond to Sean Connery 's and praised the script as smartly written , noting how the film departed from the series ' conventions . The Times compared Craig 's portrayal of the character to that of Timothy Dalton , and praised the action as " edgy " , with another reviewer citing in particular the action sequence involving the cranes in Madagascar . Critics Paul Arendt of BBC Films , Kim Newman of Empire , and Todd McCarthy of Variety all described Craig as the first actor to truly embody Ian Fleming 's James Bond from the original novel : ironic , brutal and cold . 
 The film was similarly well received in North America . MSNBC gave the movie a perfect 5 star rating . The film was described as taking James Bond " back to his roots " , similar to From Russia with Love , where the focus was on character and plot rather than the high @-@ tech gadgets and visual effects that were strongly criticised in Die Another Day . Rotten Tomatoes gave the movie an aggregate rating of 95 % , the highest rating for a wide @-@ release of the year . It is the fourth @-@ highest rating for a Bond film on the site behind Goldfinger which received a 96 % , From Russia with Love which received a 96 % , and Dr. No , with a 96 % score . Metacritic gave the movie a Metascore of 80 , signifying " generally favorable reviews " . Entertainment Weekly named the film as the fifth best of the series , and chose Vesper Lynd as the fourth best Bond girl in the series . Some newspaper columnists and critics were impressed enough by Craig 's performance to consider him a viable candidate for an Academy Award nomination . Roger Ebert gave the film a four out of four star rating , and wrote that " Craig makes a superb Bond ... who gives the sense of a hard man , wounded by life and his job , who nevertheless cares about people and right and wrong , " and that the film " has the answers to all my complaints about the 45 @-@ year @-@ old James Bond series , " specifically " why nobody in a Bond movie ever seems to have any real emotions . " Time Out New York 's Joshua Rothkopf called Craig " the best Bond in the franchise 's history , " citing the actor 's " crisp , hateful , Mamet @-@ worthy snarl ... This is a screwed @-@ up Bond , a rogue Bond , a bounder , a scrapper and , in the movie 's astoundingly bleak coda , an openhearted lover . " 
 Vicky Allan of the Sunday Herald noted Bond himself , and not his love interests , was sexually objectified in this film . A moment where he rises from the sea is reminiscent of Ursula Andress in Dr. No ; he feels " skewered " by Vesper Lynd 's criticism of him ; " and though it would be almost unthinkable now have a female character in a mainstream film stripped naked and threatened with genital mutilation , that is exactly what happens to Bond in [ the film ] . " So although the film backed off from past criticism of Bond girls being sex objects , " the once invincible James Bond becomes just another joint at the meat market . " This sentiment is shared by the University of Leicester 's James Chapman , author of License to Thrill , who also notes Craig 's Bond is " not yet the polished article " ; he felt his incarnation of Bond is close to Fleming 's because he is " humourless , " but is also different because " Fleming 's Bond did not enjoy killing ; Craig 's Bond seems almost to relish it . " Andrew Sarris of The New York Observer wrote that this particular Bond film is " the very first that I would seriously consider placing on my own yearly 10 @-@ best list . Furthermore , I consider Daniel Craig to be the most effective and appealing of the six actors who have played 007 , and that includes even Sean Connery . " 
 Roger Moore wrote , " Daniel Craig impressed me so greatly in his debut outing , Casino Royale , by introducing a more gritty , unrefined edge to the character that I thought Sean might just have to move over . Craig 's interpretation was like nothing we 'd seen on screen before ; Jimmy Bond was earning his stripes and making mistakes . It was intriguing to see him being castigated by M , just like a naughty schoolboy would be by his headmaster . The script showed him as a vulnerable , troubled , and flawed character . Quite the opposite to my Bond ! Craig was , and is , very much the Bond Ian Fleming had described in the books – a ruthless killing machine . It was a Bond that the public wanted . " So impressed was Moore that he chose to buy the DVD . Raymond Benson , the author of nine Bond novels , called Casino Royale " a perfect Bond film . " 
 However , the film met with mixed reactions from other critics . Rob Gonsalves of <unk> gave the film a positive review , but commented , " When you strip the 007 films down for action and ' realism , ' you lose the soul of those old beloved Bond movies – they might as well be Jason Bourne movies . " John <unk> of The Commercial Appeal said , " Who wants to see Bond learn a lesson about ego , as if he were Greg Brady in his ' Johnny Bravo ' phase ? " Anthony Lane of The New Yorker criticised the more imperfect and self @-@ aware depiction of the character , saying , " Even James Bond , in other words , wants to be 007 . " 
 Though American radio personality Michael Medved gave the film three stars out of four , describing it as " intriguing , audacious and very original ... more believable and less cartoonish , than previous 007 extravaganzas , " he commented that the " sometimes sluggish pacing will frustrate some Bond fanatics . " Similarly , a reviewer for The Sun praised the film for its darkness and Craig 's performance , but felt that " like the novel , it suffers from a lack of sharpness in the plot " and believed that it required additional editing , particularly the finale . Commentators such as Emanuel Levy concurred , feeling the ending was too long , and that the film 's terrorist villains lacked depth , although he praised Craig and gave the film a B + overall . Other reviewers responded negatively , including Tim Adams of The Observer who felt the film came off uncomfortably in an attempt to make the series grittier . 
 In December 2006 , Casino Royale was named the best film of the year by viewers of Film 2006 . The sequence with Craig sporting swimming trunks topped the sexiest male celebrity poll of The Sun , and in 2009 Del Monte Foods launched an ice <unk> moulded to resemble Craig emerging from the sea . In 2008 , Entertainment Weekly named it the 19th best film of the past 25 years .

 According to Kahn , Spears pitched him her original concept , which included all the main elements used in the final version . Spears thought of the video as a sequel to " Toxic " , as seen in her documentary Britney : For the Record , whereas Kahn approached it as " a 2008 answer " to the previous clip . He added that , " ' Toxic ' was a crystallization of her career at that time , [ ... ] There are elements and moments of that I felt could [ have been ] improved . [ ' Womanizer ' ] is a bit more fashion @-@ forward " . About how the concept of the video related to their previous work , Kahn commented that " It 's just a great girl fantasy . There are things she 's really good at , like having a really natural knack for knowing what girls want . [ ... ] It 's a much more mature sound and much more mature lyrics , and she always has the greatest ideas . She 's hyper @-@ aware of pop culture " . 
 The costumes and looks for each of the different women were chosen by Spears and Kahn . The scenes in the sauna were suggested by Kahn , as a response to the attacks Spears received over the years about her weight . He stated , " I knew that the whole world would be watching , so I wanted something in there that stated , ' This is Britney , this is why you should respect her ' " .

 " Womanizer " was also performed at the Femme Fatale Tour ( 2011 ) as the last song of the fourth act . Following " I Wanna Go " , which featured her dancing with members of the audience onstage , Spears performed " Womanizer " while surrounded by her dancers dressed as police officers . Shirley Halperin of The Hollywood Reporter stated that " [ the ] mid @-@ tempo numbers [ ... ] seemed to stall out quickly , where faster offerings like ' Womanizer , ' ' I Wanna Go ' and ' Toxic ' had the sold out crowd jumping in place and pumping their number twos in the air . " Ed Masley of The Arizona Republic called the back @-@ to @-@ back performances of " I Wanna Go " and " Womanizer " " a triumphant double shot of dance @-@ pop greatness . " Keith <unk> of Billboard said the performance " seemed a bit flat after the crowd @-@ <unk> ' I Wanna Go . ' " Spears is currently performing " Womanizer " as the second song for her Las Vegas residency , Britney : Piece of Me at The AXIS theater . She is accompanied by dancers clad in spandex outfits and masks , and walks on their backs . 
 The song was later performed in a greatest hits medley , at the 2016 Billboard Music Awards .

 = Infamous ( video game ) = 
 Infamous ( stylized as inFAMOUS ) is an action @-@ adventure video game developed by Sucker Punch Productions and published by Sony Computer Entertainment for the PlayStation 3 . The game was released in North America on May 26 , 2009 , in Europe on May 29 , 2009 , in Australia on June 4 , 2009 and in Japan on November 5 , 2009 . In Infamous , the player controls the protagonist Cole MacGrath , a bike messenger caught in the center of an explosion that devastates several city blocks of the fictional Empire City . The explosion sends the city into chaos while Cole finds himself with new electricity @-@ based super powers . Though the game 's story follows Cole using his new abilities to restore some semblance of order to Empire City , the player is given several opportunities to use these powers for good or evil purposes in the game 's Karma system . These choices ultimately affect character growth , the reaction of the City 's populace towards Cole , and finer elements of gameplay and the story . 
 Sucker Punch developed Infamous as a change of pace from their earlier Sly Cooper series of stealth @-@ based games , but using a similar comic book @-@ inspired origin story to help the player become more connected with Cole . The game 's pacing in the introduction of new super powers and ease of movement about the city by unconventional means were critical factors during development . The desolate urban atmosphere was inspired by comics such as DMZ and Batman : No Man 's Land . Amon Tobin was among the artists that helped to compile its soundtrack , which aimed to reflect the environment . 
 The game was well received by the gaming press . It was praised for many of its elements , including the implementation of Cole 's powers and climbing ability , and the game 's content and mission structure . Reviewers commented on the repetitive nature of combat and enemies , limitations of the Karma system , and technical aspects in the graphical display . Infamous was compared to and contrasted with Radical Entertainment 's Prototype , a video game released the following month which had many elements similar to Infamous , including exploration of an open world @-@ style city by a protagonist with superpowers . The game was offered by Sony as a free download as part of their ' Welcome Back ' program , after the 2011 PlayStation Network outage . A sequel , Infamous 2 , was released on June 7 , 2011 . A third game designed specifically for the PlayStation 4 , titled Infamous Second Son , was released worldwide on March 21 , 2014 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Infamous is an action @-@ adventure and open world video game where the player controls Cole and primarily interacts with the world of Empire City through Cole 's newly gained electricity @-@ based powers ; these are used for movement , offense and defense in combat , and either for better or worse in dealing with the citizens of Empire City . In order for Cole to use his powers , he must have stored electrical power , represented by a node meter on the player 's heads up display ( HUD ) . The player can recharge Cole by draining electricity from powered sources or from living beings ; recharging also restores Cole 's health , though if the player stays out of battle long enough , Cole 's health will regenerate over time . The game features seventeen different electrical powers , ranging from simple bolts that do not consume Cole 's energy to wide @-@ field lightning storms that drain most of Cole 's energy . The player can use such powers , giving the player options in certain situations . For example , the player may fire at a generator near foes to cause it to explode and cripple his opponents , then restrain them or fire at the body to kill the enemy . 
 Due to being vivified electricity , Cole is unable to use vehicles , take up weapons , or swim . Cole easily climbs buildings and other structures and can fall a great height without taking damage . Many powers are acquired over the course of the game ; once acquired the player can use experience points , awarded for specific actions , stunts and missions , to increase the power 's effectiveness . The growth of these powers is affected by Cole 's current Karma level . Starting in a neutral position , it ranges from Guardian to Champion to Hero on the Good side , and from Thug to Outlaw to Infamous on the Evil side . Certain actions , such as stopping to help injured citizens or draining their health to restore Cole 's , will affect the Karma level in either direction . Normal story missions may also alter the Karma level . During the game the player will encounter Karma Moments , when the action pauses and the player is told , through a monologue by Cole , of two actions that can be taken , always a good and bad option . For example , one scenario the player is presented with is to either pull a valve and get a spray of tar in his face ( Good ) , or force a civilian to do it for him ( Evil ) . There are also a number of paired Good / Evil side missions in the game ; completing one will lock out the other mission but will reward the player with a large amount of Karma towards their selected Karma goal . Completion of these missions helps gain access to unique super powers based on the Karma level . The player is not locked into choosing either Karma path , and may opt to play towards one extreme and later switch to the other mid @-@ game . Doing so will lock out any purchased power ( s ) in the original chosen Karma sector . In addition to altering Cole 's appearance and certain aspects of the game 's story , Karma also influences the behavior of the citizens of Empire City , they will come to help Cole in battle if his Karma is Good , but will turn on Cole and throw rocks at him if he has Bad Karma . 
 Empire City is built on three islands , and the player must work through main story missions on each island before being able to access the next one , though future missions may require the player to return to an earlier island . Each island is divided into a number of sectors , at the start of the game controlled by three different gangs , the Neon District <unk> controlled by Sasha and her Reaper Gang , the Warren District being controlled by Alden and the Dust Men Gang , and the Historic District being controlled by Kessler and the First Sons . The player can undertake a side mission in each sector , once certain main story requirements have been met , to free that sector from gang control , reducing or eliminating the presence of the gang in that sector . Other side missions may also unlock medical stations where Cole will re @-@ awaken should he die . Though Cole must travel on foot he eventually gains powers that allow him to grind along power cables and powered , elevated train rails and to hover for a short time . Scattered around the city are hundreds of ' Blast Shards ' which Cole can collect to increase the amount of electricity he can store . There are 32 ' Dead Drop ' satellite transmitters that help to reveal more of the back @-@ story in the game , all being narrated by John White , or being recordings of Kessler and his experiments .

 The game takes place in fictional Empire City ( based on New York City ) , laid across three islands : the Neon District , where many businesses and entertainment venues are located , the Warren , the slum where goods are shipped into and out of the city , and the Historic District , the smallest of the three islands . The districts are connected by bridges , and each district has its own elevated train system . At the start of the game , six blocks of the Historic District are wiped out by an explosion from a bio @-@ electrical device called the Ray Sphere . A plague develops soon afterwards , forcing the government to quarantine the region . In doing so , they block the only bridge to the mainland from the city , causing societal collapse within the isolated city . 
 = = = Characters = = = 
 The protagonist is Cole MacGrath ( voiced by Jason Cottle ) , a bike courier of Empire City who happens to be in the center of the explosion , surviving it and gaining electricity @-@ based super powers . His best friend and fellow courier , Zeke Jedediah Dunbar ( voiced by Caleb Moody ) takes initial refuge from the chaos on the streets at a rooftop pad and becomes both impressed and envious of Cole 's newfound powers . Trish Dailey ( voiced by October Moore ) is a medical student and Cole 's girlfriend at the start of the game , who rejects him after accusing him of causing her sister 's death . Shortly after the explosion , Cole meets with FBI agent Moya Jones ( voiced by <unk> Colbourne ) , who assigns him missions to complete in Empire City in hopes of finding an agent named John White ( voiced by Phil LaMarr ) who was trapped in the city while investigating a case for another agency when the quarantine was enacted and has left numerous encoded messages on satellite receivers . A rogue VJ , " The Voice of Survival " ( real name Dallas , voiced by Derrick Forget ) , manages to broadcast his conspiracy @-@ laden , panic @-@ provoking messages across the city from a TV station , as well as a legitimate reporter who tries to give the government some PR . 
 As Cole explores the city , he confronts three others with super powers like himself , including Sasha ( voiced by Jessica Straus ) , a scorned lover and former high @-@ ranked member of the First Sons , trying to earn Cole 's romance , and has the ability to use a tar @-@ like plague @-@ inducing substance to control the minds of others . She controls the Reaper gang , ex @-@ drug dealing junkies as Cole put it , of the Neon District . Alden Tate , ( also voiced by Jason Cottle ) son of Richard , the previous leader of the First Sons , and a wizened old man with powerful telekinesis abilities that leads the Dust Men gang in the Warren District under his control . They fight the First Sons , a fraternal organization founded in medieval Europe that operates in the Historic District by Kessler ( voiced by Sam A. Mowry ) , a man with many super powers , controls the First Sons , using them to seek out Cole and the Ray Sphere , the device that caused the explosion in Empire City . 
 = = = Story = = = 
 While the basic story of the game remains unchanged whether the player opts for the " Good " or " Evil " karma path , there are some story elements that change depending on the player 's choice at that time . 
 Cole is instructed by an anonymous customer to deliver a package to a location in the Historic District , and then to open it ; unbeknownst to Cole , the package contains the Ray Sphere , which activates upon opening and wipes out six city blocks . Cole manages to survive the blast and is nursed back to health by his girlfriend Trish , during which he discovers his newfound electricity powers . After stopping members of The Reapers gang from stealing food from a supply drop , the Voice of Survival reveals Cole was responsible for the explosion and the city turns against him , including Trish , whose sister was killed in the blast . Cole and Zeke try to escape the quarantine with Cole 's new powers which results in the army opening fire on them along with a crowd of escapees . Zeke escapes by jumping off the bridge into the harbor and Cole jumps into a container on the side of the bridge and inside meets Moya , a high ranking government agent , who convinces Cole to return to Empire City to seek out the Ray Sphere and her husband John in exchange for Cole and his friends ' release from quarantine . Cole proceeds to follow Moya 's orders , restoring power to the city to be able to fight off the various gangs that have taken over . As he comes to interact with Sasha , Alden , and Kessler , the leaders of each gang , he learns that Kessler displaced Alden from the leadership of the First Sons , an organized crime group , and initiated construction of the Ray Sphere , while rejecting Sasha 's attempts for romance . Cole is able to defeat Sasha and capture Alden , but during a breakout attempt by the Dust Men , Zeke 's own heroism antics allow Alden to go free , much to Cole 's irritation . Later , Cole and Zeke track down Alden , who has recovered the Ray Sphere ; Cole is able to distract Alden long enough for Zeke to recover it . However , Zeke is caught between Alden and Kessler , and realizes that he could gain superpowers himself through the Sphere and activates it , but nothing happens . Kessler knows what went wrong and offers Zeke power in exchange for assistance to fix it . Zeke agrees and departs with Kessler , taking the Ray Sphere with him . 
 Cole is finally able to track down John , but learns that John is neither from the FBI nor Moya 's husband , but instead an undercover NSA agent who assisted in the creation of the Ray Sphere . John explains that the Ray Sphere consumes the bio @-@ energy from those around it and transfers that power to the person holding it , granting them superpowers at the cost of thousands of lives . John urges Cole to help him find and destroy it . Alden goes on a killing spree while heading into the Historic District . After a long battle , Alden is defeated and jumps off the bridge . During the battle , Alden destroys huge sections of the bridge . Cut off from the Warren , Cole goes ahead into the Historic District . As they search for the Ray Sphere , Cole discovers that Kessler has kidnapped Trish along with six other doctors , and forces Cole to choose between saving her or the other doctors . Regardless of the player 's choice , Kessler has arranged for Trish to fall to her death , but is briefly revived by Cole . If the player has good Karma , Trish will be proud of Cole and profess her love , while if the player has bad Karma , she will curse his name with her dying breath . After mourning for her loss , Cole works with John to recover the Ray Sphere ; the player can then opt to either destroy it or use it to further enhance Cole 's powers ( which also gives him red and black electricity ) , but either option causes the Ray Sphere to malfunction , disintegrating John . Once the player chooses their side , they cannot change their Karma level , either being Hero rank ( Good Karma ) or Infamous ( Bad Karma ) . 
 Cole then goes to face Kessler at Ground Zero of the original explosion . As they fight , Zeke appears and tries to intervene but is tossed aside by Kessler . This scene is the last time Zeke is shown in the game . Cole eventually mortally wounds Kessler . Kessler uses his last actions to implant his memories into Cole 's mind , revealing that Kessler is a version of Cole from the future of an alternate timeline . In that timeline , Cole ( as Kessler ) and Trish were happily wed with children , but soon the appearance of an entity known as the Beast plunged their world into chaos . Kessler and Trish fled with their children rather than fight , but after years of running , the Beast eventually caught up to them and killed his family . Kessler realized the only way to stop the Beast would be to use his powers to go back in time and prepare his past self , Cole , for battle against it as it was too late to fight back in Kessler 's time . Kessler seized control of the First Sons from Alden , manipulating then shunning Sasha 's advances due to his past love for Trish , and ordered the construction of the Ray Sphere much earlier than in his timeline . Kessler was also the anonymous customer that directed Cole to use it . Kessler used Trish 's death as a means of making sure Cole could choose the impossible in the battle with the Beast . After Kessler dies from the battle , Cole declares his hatred for Kessler , and says he will be ready when the Beast arrives . 
 The ending of the game depends on the player 's Karma . If the player 's Karma is good , Empire City continues to rebuild itself , while still idolizing Cole as its savior . However , Cole realizes that he can never lead a ' normal ' life again due to the city 's dependence on him , and laments that he has " never been more alone " , citing his growing estrangement with Zeke and his severed ties with Moya . If the player 's Karma is evil , Empire City has fully slid into chaos . The sky is red , people are dying in the streets , and Cole recognizes himself as the strongest person alive . Declaring Kessler an idiot for thinking he would use his powers for the greater good , he then laughs at the idea of using them to fight The Beast . Once the storyline is finished , the player can continue to gain XP and collect Blast Shards . 
 = = Development and release = = 
 Infamous was developed by Sucker Punch Productions , with a team of 60 people working for about three years . Though they could have opted to request the necessary funds from Sony to increase the team size and finish the game in two years , producer Brian Fleming noted that Sucker Punch 's iteration @-@ based development approach worked better with a smaller team size . 
 Infamous came during the end of the development for Sly 3 : Honor Among Thieves as the team began to look towards their next game . After spending the last six years on the same stealth game genre with the Sly Cooper games , they wanted to make something that was more " brazen and loud . " However , as fans of the " comic book " motif , they decided to develop it in the direction of a superhero game , working with the idea of an origin story that would allow the player to experience the growth of the character . Fleming stated that with the slower development time , they knew they needed to develop the game for the PlayStation 3 and that the work needed to complement their previous game , akin to how Shigeru Miyamoto 's The Legend of Zelda series contrasted his earlier Mario series . They also sought a project that would allow them to become familiar with the new PlayStation 3 hardware but had enough commonalities to allow them to bring their previous work on the Sly Cooper series forward . 
 Director Nate Fox stated that much of the inspiration of the superhero story came from two DC Comics series , DMZ and Batman : No Man 's Land . Both center on a city after a large disaster . The series also inspired the crafting of the game 's grim take on the superhero genre . Fox further stated that the film Batman Begins was an inspiration for the game . However , any correlation to DC Comics ' Static Shock was unintentional . Fox considered his own personal involvement in the Seattle WTO riots of 1999 as influencing the reflection of " spending time in a lawless place " within the game . Grand Theft Auto III was also stated as an influence , in that the team could easily see themselves as superheroes in the open world of Liberty City ; similarly , Spider @-@ Man 2 was used as a model to demonstrate what it would be like to move about the city and answer random requests for help alongside regular missions . The character of Cole was created to be a " kind of an everyman " so that players could then " get into the headspace of what it would be like to be a real human being who has been granted these exceptional abilities " . The team also avoided giving Cole an alter @-@ ego or outfitting him with a costume as it would not have reasonably fit in with the character or the game 's story . 
 The story and cut scene animations were created in @-@ house . The plot was originally written by Fox , who had also written most of the Sly Cooper stories , and reviewed by Fleming . As they continued to develop the game , they rewrote pieces of the story to reflect changes in the game , making sure that the story remained enjoyable . As the game became more complex , they brought in Bill Harms , a published comic book author , who had previously written for Supreme Commander and other video games . Harms assisted with the story and in @-@ game dialog in addition to marketing materials . Fleming noted that the second half of the story underwent significant changes in the last nine months of development ; for example , when voice actor Caleb Moody voiced the lines for Zeke , he ad libbed additional lines that the team found to be enjoyable , and they reworked the story to incorporate them . The cut scenes were created in a similar format to the comics that the game was influenced by , and used to further extend the atmosphere of the superhero motif . The cut scenes were created by taking 2D art created in Corel Painter and Adobe Photoshop and placing them into artificial 3D stages built in Adobe After Effects to create a pseudo @-@ 3D effect that allowed them to play with camera placement and effects , and addition of organic elements such as dust clouds and ink spots . 
 Darren Bridges , a developer for Sucker Punch , noted that they wanted to make Infamous about " becoming a modern @-@ day superhero " , stressing the word " becoming " as the key motivator to show the growth of Cole from a simple bike messenger to someone with god @-@ like powers . This led to instilling a " sense of progress " and growth of the character in all aspects of the game including the story , the progression of the player 's powers , and the variation and difficulty in the enemies that the player faced . The team initially brainstormed on what powers that the lead character had , but selected electricity @-@ based powers for two primary reasons . First , the power translated well to a video game context , as it would be easy to conceptualize the aspects of electrical @-@ based powers in terms of video game concepts such as ranged combat . Secondly , electrical @-@ based powers could then be tied to the city that the player would explore , requiring the player to use the city 's electricity as fuel , and thus developing a " real relationship with the city " . 
 Initially , the game was more free @-@ form , allowing players to purchase new powers at any point during the game , but the developers found it difficult to create a challenging game on that basis , particularly as they could not design missions calling for specific powers that the player may not have at that time . This evolved into the scheme of presenting new powers to the player over the course of the game , with the developers created guiding rules for which powers were ultimately included in the game and when : the power had to be useful and add something unique to the game , the player would need a chance to use that power immediately after they got it , and the power would need to be enjoyable to use . The team employed frequent reviews of when these powers were introduced to the player as other gameplay elements were added to the game . Not all powers were necessarily offensive ; the " <unk> " power , allowing the player to see the psychic echo of a dead person of where they were before their death , was added as the team found there was an element of fun in tracking the echo through the crowded city . Some powers were cut from the game . One power , gained through the Evil karma path , was called " <unk> " , and would have allowed Cole to control the minds of civilians and force them to join him in battle . Although the power was " decidedly evil and very fun to watch " , the team felt it wasn 't useful to the game , though they managed to retain a hint of it in one of the Evil side missions . Though the team had tested each of the core missions individually with the powers that the player would have based on the game 's storyboard , they found that play @-@ testers , who played the missions back @-@ to @-@ back , found the game lacked a variety of combat situations . The developers revisited all the combat scenarios from this feedback to alter the combat layouts as well as adding new enemies , a step that Bridges believes the game " benefited greatly " from . The ability to use Cole 's electrical powers to ride along Empire City 's elevated train rails was a last @-@ minute addition during the last month of development based on a play @-@ tester 's suggestion . 
 Empire City was designed to marry with Cole 's new @-@ found superpowers . The city was built with a " crime ecosystem " , where petty crimes or calls for help were always occurring outside of the main story , requiring the player to decide to stop to help or not to resolve them . A portion of the team was devoted to implementing the behavior of the citizens of the city and how that behavior would change as the state of the city altered due to the player 's actions . Climbing buildings was considered to be an important aspect of the game , both as part of the superhero motif and because it was considered " fun to do " , and Sucker Punch set out to make the whole city climbable . Many details of every building have been modeled to allow the player to climb the buildings , " down to the last window frame , lighting sconce and storefront " , however , Fox noted that getting the climbing system " just right " was the most challenging aspect of development . One employee was dedicated to making sure the entire city was climbable . Fleming noted that during Infamous 's development , both Crackdown and Assassin 's Creed , two games with alternative takes on the climbing aspect , were released ; the team felt that each of the games ' climbing systems had their own strengths and weaknesses . To reflect the nature of change of the city as the player interacts with it — either restoring power or taking it away — the developers created a " deferred shading " rendering engine that would render the effects of moving and damaged light sources . 
 The Karma system in the game came about as a result of the team wanting to include the " judicious use of power " within the game . Fox commented that they wanted to lead the player along a path of doing the harder tasks believing that these actions were the right things to do . However , without the contrast of " evil " tasks that were simpler to complete , there would be no means of motivating the player to be a " selfless hero " . The team wanted to encourage players to think about the results of not only large decisions — Karma moments in the game where Cole thinks of which option to select — but also every moment @-@ to @-@ moment action , such as considering the presence of civilians in the area around a battle . They arranged for the first major use of Cole 's powers to turn the city 's inhabitants against him , to encourage players to consider both sides . In this mission , Cole is given the option to keep a drop @-@ supply of food for himself or to give it to the people ; they found that most players would give it to the people , but very shortly after this event , the population turns against Cole due to evidence linking him to the explosion , forcing the player to run or to attack them . Fox compared the Karma dichotomy to the differences in styles of Batman versus the Punisher ; the former using precision attacks to avoid harming innocents while the latter would hurt anything in his path to complete his goal . To that end , they designed the powers in the game to reflect this nature ; powers acquired with Good Karma would be more precise while Evil Karma powers were more destructive .

 The soundtrack is composed by the electronic musician Amon Tobin , composers James Dooley and Mel Wesson , and electric cellist Martin Tillman , under the direction of Sony 's music manager , Jonathan Mayer . Tobin was specifically brought on board due to his recent trend of blurring the lines between music and sound design as exhibited in his then @-@ recent album , Foley Room . Instead of using traditional instruments , the team sought to use sounds that results from objects that would be found in an urban environment and using such objects in combination with other instruments used in non @-@ traditional manners ; for example , bungee cords were strung alongside a bass drum and strummed , and wire brushes were hit against a suspended tuba . The music was divided between Tobin , who worked on the in @-@ game music , and Dooley who worked on the music for the cinematics ; the two worked together to make sure common musical themes were present in both aspects . Tillman was brought in late to the process to add the cello sounds , but the group was so impressed with his work that they remixed already @-@ completed pieces to incorporate his contribution further . Manchester music group , Working for a Nuclear Free City were commissioned by Sony to produce a song for the game . The song was penned " Silent Melody " and was used in one of the game 's promotional trailers . The soundtrack was released for digital download from the iTunes Store in May 2009 .

 The game was overall well received by game critics . Greg Miller of IGN considered the title to be " one of the best PlayStation 3 games to date " . Core to the game 's success , according to reviewers , were the basic mechanics of the game . Giant Bomb 's Brad Shoemaker considered that Sucker Punch had " nailed the basic gameplay elements " , tying all the various aspects of the game together . The mixture of Cole 's powers with the Karma elements of the game were also praised . The powers and Karma system were seen to bring difficult choices to how the player approach battles . Both sides of the Karma system were considered to be fun to play . The mission structure was considered a strong asset of the game . According to X @-@ Play 's Matt Kiel , the missions forced the player to consider the full extent of Cole 's powers through their difficulty but provided " generous " checkpoints to prevent too much frustration with the game . Reviewers cited the variation in side missions and how they related to the main story as positive aspects of the game . 
 The presentation of Empire City was also considered to be a significant factor of the success of the game . The climbing and grabbing aspect was considered well done and avoided a " frustration @-@ fest " that other games with precision jumping generally bring about , according to Miller . However , some reviewers noted that Cole 's climbing ability was too touchy , with the character grabbing onto ledges too greedily , making it difficult to fine @-@ tune jumps . In combination with Cole 's other powers , Miller cited the game as having the " most original city @-@ traversal mechanics " for an open @-@ world game . The behavior of the city 's population and how that was affected by the player 's choice in Karma was also seen as a positive , and as a constant reminder of the game 's setting . The game 's story , particularly in the second half of the game , was considered to be strong , enhanced by presentation of the cut @-@ scenes . However , the quality of these scenes was seen to negatively highlight the poor animation used for in @-@ game generated cut @-@ scenes and the quality of the voice work ; Miller considered Cole 's voice to be too gravelly for the character . 
 The initial hours of the game , before the player started to acquire some of the more potent powers , were considered to be difficult and may be off @-@ putting to some . Tom Bramwell of Eurogamer noted the remainder of the game continues to have some difficult sections , such as sections where the player must defend a moving target against a large number of foes , and considered these to be " repetitive and overlong " . Bramwell further commented that the electrical powers in the game are simply electricity @-@ based reimaginings of standard video game weapon archetypes , such as shotguns and sniper rifles , and , with this awareness , leaves the difficulty of the game up to the enemy placement during encounters . The game is also considered to be rough around the edges in technical execution , with the lack of anti @-@ aliasing and occasional " pop @-@ in " rendering , as well as drops in frame rates when there was a significant amount of action on the screen . 
 Infamous was released a few weeks before Radical Entertainment 's Prototype , a game with many similar concepts including a character finding himself with super powers , a large open @-@ world environment that can be traveled by climbing up buildings and gliding about the city , and several other comparisons . This led many game critics to compare and contrast the games . In his sarcastic Zero Punctuation review of Prototype , Ben " Yahtzee " Croshaw ( who had initially praised Infamous as " huge , creative and fun , " ) compared the two games point for point , and determined that he could not tell which was the better game , and challenged the respective studios to " produce the best image of the rival game 's main character wearing a women 's bra " as a tiebreaker . To his surprise , both development teams rose to the challenge , producing said images , and forcing Croshaw to call it a near @-@ tie , edging out in favor of Infamous , though still noted that , like their games , both images created independently were nearly equal in the assets that they included . This rivalry highlighted the advantages and disadvantages of exclusivity over a multiplatform release . Gaming analysts Jesse Divnich had this to say " Due to near identical game play and quality scores , the Infamous vs. Prototype case study presents interesting data to publishers when considering the sales bump a title could receive by choosing exclusivity over a multiplatform release . " 
 Infamous was released at the end of May , and the game sold 175 @,@ 900 copies in the United States on its opening week , recorded in May 2009 sales according to the NPD Group , and sold 192 @,@ 700 copies in the United States over the month of June 2009 , the 10th highest @-@ selling game that month . In June 2010 , Game Informer stated Infamous sold nearly two million copies . IGN awarded Infamous Best Story , and Game of the Year and Best Acting at the 2009 Golden Game Awards . Infamous was also nominated for four other Golden Game Awards , including Best PlayStation 3 Game , Best Graphics , Best Independent Game , and Studio of the Year . 
 On September 4 , 2010 , Infamous was ranked fifth in " The Top 25 PlayStation 3 Games " of IGN , stating that " when Infamous was released on PlayStation 3 in the spring of 2009 , it quickly became clear that this was unlike any sandbox game anyone had ever played " . 
 = Zaharije Ostojić = 
 Zaharije Ostojić ( Serbian Cyrillic : <unk> <unk> ; 1907 – April 1945 ) was a Montenegrin Serb military officer who served as the chief of the operational , organisational and intelligence branches of the Chetnik Supreme Command led by Draža Mihailović in Yugoslavia during World War II . He was a major in the Yugoslav Royal Air Force prior to the Axis invasion of Yugoslavia , and was involved in the coup that deposed Prince Paul of Yugoslavia on 27 March 1941 . After the coup , he escorted Prince Paul to exile in Greece , and was in Cairo at the time of the invasion in April . In September 1941 , he was landed on the Italian @-@ occupied Montenegrin coast along with a British Special Operations Executive ( SOE ) liaison officer and two companions . He escorted the SOE officer to the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia and introduced him to the Yugoslav Partisan leader Josip Broz Tito then Mihailović . Ostojić soon became Mihailović 's chief of staff , and after the German attempt to capture the Chetnik leader during Operation Mihailović in December 1941 , brought the Chetnik Supreme staff to Montenegro where they were re @-@ united with Mihailović in June 1942 . During the remainder of 1942 , Ostojić launched a counter @-@ attack against Ustaše troops of the Independent State of Croatia returning to the eastern Bosnian town of Foča where they were expected to continue their genocidal anti @-@ Serb policies . As many as 2 @,@ 000 local Muslims were subsequently killed in the town by forces under Ostojić 's command . Ostojić later oversaw large @-@ scale massacres of civilians and burning of Muslim villages in the border region between Montenegro and the Sandžak . 
 While the Chetniks were an anti @-@ Axis movement in their long @-@ range goals and did engage in marginal resistance activities for limited periods , they also carried out almost throughout the war a tactical or selective collaboration with the occupation authorities against the Partisans . The Chetnik movement adopted a policy of collaboration with the Axis powers , and engaged in cooperation to one degree or another by establishing modus vivendi or operating as auxiliary forces under Axis control . This was demonstrated in late 1942 and early 1943 , when Ostojić planned and oversaw the Chetnik involvement in the large Axis anti @-@ Partisan offensive Case White alongside Italian troops . In 1944 , he became a leader of the Chetnik forces in Herzegovina , and along with Dobroslav Jevđević was involved in attempts to come to terms with the Allied forces . In late 1944 , as the Partisans tightened their grip on the country and the Soviet Red Army captured Belgrade , he re @-@ joined Mihailović in northeastern Bosnia but they could not agree on what course of action to take . Ostojić , along with Chetnik leaders Pavle Đurišić and Petar Baćović and Chetnik ideologue Dragiša Vasić decided to move west to the area of the Ljubljana Gap in modern @-@ day Slovenia where other friendly forces were concentrating . In early April 1945 , faced with attacks by the Partisans and the Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia ( HOS ) along their route , the combined Chetnik force was defeated by HOS forces in the Battle of Lijevče Field , after which Ostojić was captured by the Ustaše in an apparent trap . According to some sources , he was killed in the Jasenovac concentration camp alongside Đurišić , Baćović and Vasić . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Zaharije Ostojić was a Montenegrin Serb , and was born in 1907 in the village of <unk> Do , near the Adriatic seaport of Bar in the Principality of Montenegro . He joined the Yugoslav Royal Air Force and prior to the outbreak of World War II had risen to the rank of major . Little else is known of Ostojić 's early life , but his sister was married to Royal Yugoslav Army Brigadier General Ljubo Novaković . 
 = = To Cairo and back = = 
 After the outbreak of World War II , the government of Regent Prince Paul of Yugoslavia declared its neutrality . Despite this , and with the aim of securing his southern flank for the pending attack on the Soviet Union , Adolf Hitler began placing heavy pressure on the Kingdom of Yugoslavia to sign the Tripartite Pact and join the Axis . After some delay , the Yugoslav government conditionally signed the Pact on 25 March 1941 . Two days later a bloodless coup d 'état deposed Prince Paul and declared 17 @-@ year @-@ old Prince Peter II of Yugoslavia of age . Ostojić was involved in the coup through his close relationship with one of the main instigators , the commander of the Yugoslav Royal Air Force Brigadier General Borivoje Mirković . Ostojić escorted Prince Paul to exile in Greece and then traveled on to Cairo . Following the subsequent German @-@ led invasion of Yugoslavia and the Yugoslav capitulation 11 days later , Ostojić remained in Cairo until he was selected to join a combined British – Yugoslav Special Operations Executive team which was to infiltrate into occupied Yugoslavia and make contact with resistance groups . The other members of the team were Captain Bill Hudson , a fellow Yugoslav Air Force officer , Major Mirko <unk> , and a radio operator . They flew from Cairo to Malta on 13 September 1941 , before being landed from the British submarine HMS Triumph on the Montenegrin coast near Petrovac between 20 and 22 September 1941 . They quickly came into contact with Montenegrin Partisans , including Milovan Đilas and <unk> Jovanović , who escorted Hudson and Ostojić to Partisan @-@ held Užice in the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia . While Hudson familiarised himself with the Partisans , Ostojić went on to Mihailović 's headquarters at Ravna Gora , but after briefing Mihailović went back to escort Hudson to Ravna Gora , arriving there on 25 October . When he first arrived at Ravna Gora , Ostojić had delivered a message to Mihailović from the War Minister of the Yugoslav government @-@ in @-@ exile , Bogoljub Ilić , assuring him of the official support of the government @-@ in @-@ exile , but stating that " a rebellion would not be tolerated " . Ostojić also told Mihailović that the communists had taken control of Montenegro . Ostojić and <unk> then assumed senior staff positions in Mihailović 's supreme command headquarters . 
 = = Move to Montenegro = = 
 After Mihailović went on the run in early December 1941 in the wake of Operation Uzice , Operation <unk> and the split with the Partisans , Ostojić maintained a small headquarters consisting mainly of the intelligence branch , which remained close to Mihailović and his small personal staff as he moved around the Rudnik mountain area during the remaining winter months of 1941 – 42 . Mihailović eventually made his way to Montenegro , where he arrived in June 1942 . Ostojić , Hudson and other officers joined him soon after , travelling through Italian @-@ held towns by truck disguised as troops of the Nedić regime . 
 In a directive letter dated 30 July 1942 , Ostojić urged all Chetnik commanders to " develop the strongest possible oral and written propaganda " . He stated that , " the people must be persuaded that the Chetniks are their only friends and that it is from them that they can expect freedom and a happy life " and instructed the Chetniks to " work day and night and maintain the spirit of the people " . He wrote , " the hour of freedom is near . Allied aid for the Chetniks is assured , and the whole world is admiring them . " In August , he launched a counterattack against Ustaše troops returning to Foča as the Italians withdrew their garrisons from the hinterland . The Chetniks feared the Ustaše were about to unleash another round of genocidal violence on the Serb population in the area . At least 2 @,@ 000 local Muslims were subsequently killed in Foča by forces under Ostojić 's command . 
 In November 1942 , Ostojić was encouraged by Mihailović to wage a campaign of terror against the Muslim population living along the borders of Montenegro and the Sandžak , and subsequently reported that Chetniks had destroyed 21 villages and killed about 1 @,@ 300 people . Between 30 November and 2 December 1942 , Ostojić represented Mihailović at the Conference of Young Chetnik Intellectuals of Montenegro at the village of Šahovići near Bijelo Polje in the Sandžak , which was also attended by Đurišić . The conference was dominated by Đurišić and its resolutions " expressed extremism and intolerance " , as well as an agenda which was focused on restoring the pre @-@ war status quo in Yugoslavia implemented in its initial stages by a Chetnik dictatorship . It also laid claim to parts of the territory of Yugoslavia 's neighbors . 
 = = Operation Weiss = = 
 A few weeks after the conference , Mihailović sent Ostojić to establish a forward headquarters in Kalinovik in south @-@ eastern Bosnia . Ostojić was to command an operation aimed at encircling and destroying Partisan forces in Bosnia , which was to utilise Chetnik units serving as Italian auxiliaries in Herzegovina and Montenegro , as well as other Chetnik units in the Lika region , northern Bosnia and northern Dalmatia . The plan was predicated on an Allied landing on the Dalmatian coast , which Mihailović believed was imminent . The outline concept was that the Chetniks would set up a corridor through the Italian occupied zone of the NDH as far as the Partisan liberated area in western Bosnia and Lika , neutralising the Italians through a combination of vague promises , encouraging them to surrender , and disarming them if necessary . The plan was finalised by early December 1942 at Mihailović 's headquarters in Montenegro , and operations were planned to commence on 5 January 1943 . However , the plan assumed that Mihailović 's forces were unified , which they were not , and also that his authority extended to many more Chetniks than it did in reality . 
 However , what transpired instead was that the Chetniks that were preparing for the " march on Bosnia " were drawn into closer collaboration with the Axis during the second phase of Case White that took place in the Neretva and Rama river valleys in late February 1943 . During this offensive , between 12 @,@ 000 and 15 @,@ 000 Chetniks fought alongside Italian forces , and in one case alongside German and Croatian troops against the Partisans . Despite the fact that the Chetniks were an anti @-@ Axis movement in their long @-@ range goals and did engage in marginal resistance activities for limited periods , their involvement in Case White is one of the most significant examples of their tactical or selective collaboration with the Axis occupation forces . In this instance , the participating Chetniks operated as legalised auxiliary forces under Italian control . Ostojić believed that it was actions such as these that would cost the Chetniks the support of the Allies , and he wrote to Mihailović that the Allies would probably have supported the Chetniks had they been more involved in fighting the occupation . Ostojić told Mihailović that his officers also held this view , and proposed that Chetnik collaboration be reconsidered . However , upon receiving Ostojić 's message , Mihailović did not even consider changing his strategy . 
 The plan that Ostojić drew up called for the Chetniks to remain south of the Neretva to avoid being outflanked by the Partisans . However , this essentially defensive strategy was rejected by Herzegovinian Chetnik commanders such as Dobroslav Jevđević and Bajo Stanišić , who wished to follow the Axis @-@ led offensive strategy . This placed Ostojić in a very difficult position , with some of his key detachment commanders following the orders of the Italians rather than his , while the Chetniks were reliant on Italian air and artillery support , particularly around Jablanica . Ostojić subsequently changed his mind and supported the Italian offensive plans , launching an attack against the Partisans retreating from Jablanica to Prozor on 27 February 1943 . The attack was indecisive and Ostojić reprimanded the detachment commanders responsible , particularly Stanišić . 
 During this phase Ostojić first asked Jevđević to obtain more supplies from the Italians , and then when they refused , threatened to declare war on them . By early March , just as the Partisans were forcing a crossing of the Neretva at Jablanica , Mihailović joined Ostojić . In a letter to one of his other Montenegrin Chetnik commanders , Mihailović stated that he was managing the whole operation through Ostojić , although Mihailović later denied that he was in charge of the operation when questioned during his trial by a Partisan court after the war . Mihailović and Ostojić realised that the large concentrations of Chetnik troops in and around Mostar and the nearby bauxite mines were likely to draw German attention , and while they were focused on this issue , the Partisans forced a crossing of the Neretva . 
 Within a week of Mihailović 's arrival the Partisans had successfully crossed the Neretva , and within another week they had forced the Chetniks to withdraw , losing Nevesinje then Kalinovik to the Partisans before the end of March . During the fighting , Chetnik commanders had been ill @-@ disciplined and had failed to cooperate , causing Ostojić to threaten them with courts martial and summary execution . Mihailović ordered Ostojić to pull the Chetniks back towards positions on the line of the Drina – Piva rivers , some 80 – 90 kilometres ( 50 – 56 mi ) southeast of Jablanica . By this point the Chetniks had suffered heavy losses , and the Partisans broke through the combined Italian – Chetnik defence line in early April . In a report dated November 1944 , Colonel S.W. " Bill " Bailey , the senior British liaison officer with the Chetniks during the war , stated that both Ostojić and Major Vojislav Lukačević had been very critical of Mihailović 's " foolhardy , though brave , tactical handling " of Chetnik forces during Case White , which had " contributed largely to the failure of operations " . However , Ostojić himself did not possess the necessary authority with his subordinate commanders , had been unable to cope with the rapidly changing situation , had adopted an unpopular and ineffective defensive strategy , and had then blamed the detachment commanders for the Chetnik failures . 
 = = 1943 – 1944 = = 
 In July 1943 , the Montenegrin Partisan leader Đilas contacted both Ostojić and Baćović to establish their willingness to work jointly against the Axis occupiers , given that a new government @-@ in @-@ exile was about to be established without Mihailović . They reported this contact to Mihailović who threatened to exclude them from his Chetnik organisation if they maintained contact with the Partisans . 
 By September 1944 , Ostojić had been promoted to lieutenant colonel , and was the Chetnik area commander in eastern Bosnia . In early September 1944 , as Mihailović had been removed as Minister of the Army , Navy and Air Force with the demise of the <unk> government @-@ in @-@ exile , Ostojić tried to make contact with Allied forces in Italy , and agreed with Lukačević to issue a proclamation to the people explaining that they were going to attack the Germans . After 12 September 1944 , when King Peter called for all in Yugoslavia to rally around Tito , he and Baćović warned Mihailović that their men were losing their will to fight the Partisans . Concerned that the Russians would hand the Chetniks over to the Partisans , he then contacted the United States Office of Strategic Services ( OSS ) liaison officer with the Chetniks , Colonel Robert H. McDowell , but was unable to arrange for the Chetniks to be placed under American command . 
 = = Retreat and death = = 
 After the fall of Belgrade on 20 October 1944 , Mihailović and a force of a few hundred of his Chetniks withdrew from Serbian territory , crossed the Drina and based themselves in the Majevica mountain area north of Tuzla in north @-@ eastern Bosnia . Ostojić , who was commanding Herzegovinian Chetniks , was joined by Đurišić and his Montenegrin Chetniks and together they withdrew towards Mihailović . 
 From the time he joined Mihailović in northeastern Bosnia , Đurišić was very critical of Mihailović 's leadership , and argued strongly for all the remaining Chetnik troops to move to the area of the Ljubljana Gap in modern @-@ day Slovenia . At this point Ostojić and Baćović were also questioning Mihailović 's plans . When Mihailović remained unconvinced , Đurišić decided to move to the Ljubljana Gap independent of Mihailović , and arranged for Dimitrije Ljotić 's forces already in the Ljubljana Gap to meet him near Bihać in western Bosnia to assist his movement . When he left Mihailović , he was joined by Chetnik ideologue Dragiša Vasić and the Chetnik detachments commanded by Ostojić and Baćović as well as a large number of refugees . 
 In order to get to Bihać , Đurišić made a safe @-@ conduct agreement with elements of the Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia ( HOS ) and with the Montenegrin separatist Sekula Drljević . The details of the agreement are not known , but it appears Đurišić , Ostojić and Baćović and their troops were meant to cross the Sava river into Slavonia where they would be aligned with Drljević as the " Montenegrin National Army " with Đurišić retaining operational command . The Chetniks however , appear to have tried to outsmart the HOS forces and Drljević by sending their sick and wounded across the river , but retaining their fit troops south of the river , after which they began moving them westwards . Harassed by both the HOS troops and Partisans , they reached the Vrbas river , which they began to cross . In the Battle of Lijevče Field , north of Banja Luka , the combined Chetnik force was badly beaten by a strong HOS force which possessed German @-@ supplied tanks . 
 Following this defeat and the defection of one of their sub @-@ units to Drljević , Đurišić was induced to negotiate directly with the leaders of the HOS forces about the further movement of the Chetniks towards the Ljubljana Gap . However , this appears to have been a trap , as he was attacked and captured by them on his way to the meeting . According to the historian Professor Jozo Tomasevich , exactly what occurred after his capture is not clear , but Baćović , Đurišić , Vasić , Ostojić were subsequently killed , along with some Serbian Orthodox priests and others . According to some sources , on 20 April , Đurišić , Baćović , Vasić and Ostojić were taken to the Stara Gradiška prison , near Jasenovac . The Ustaše gathered them in a field alongside 5 @,@ 000 other Chetnik prisoners and arranged for Drljević and his followers to select 150 Chetnik officers and non @-@ combatant intellectuals for execution . Đurišić , Baćović , Vasić and Ostojić were amongst those selected . They and the others were loaded onto boats by the Ustaše and taken across the Sava River , never to be seen again . It is reported that they were killed either in the Jasenovac concentration camp itself , or in a marsh in its vicinity . The website of the Jasenovac Memorial Site says Ostojić was killed at the camp by the Ustaše in 1945 . The location of Ostojić 's grave , if any , is unknown . Both the NDH forces and Drljević had reasons for ensnaring Đurišić . The NDH forces were motivated by the mass terror committed by Đurišić on the Muslim population in Sandžak and southeastern Bosnia while Drljević was opposed to Đurišić 's support of a union of Serbia and Montenegro which ran counter to Drljević 's separatism .

 = New Brighton Tower = 
 New Brighton Tower was a steel lattice observation tower at New Brighton in the town of Wallasey , Cheshire ( now in the Borough of Wirral , in Merseyside ) , England . It stood 567 feet ( 173 m ) high , and was the tallest building in Great Britain when it opened some time between 1898 and 1900 . Neglected during the First World War and requiring renovation the owners could not afford , dismantling of the tower began in 1919 , and the metal was sold for scrap . The building at its base , housing the Tower Ballroom , continued in use until damaged by fire in 1969 . 
 The tower was set in large grounds , which included a boating lake , a funfair , gardens , and a sports ground . The sports ground housed , at different times , a football team , an athletics track and a motorcycle speedway track . The Beatles played at the Tower Ballroom 27 times , more than at any other venue in the United Kingdom except the Cavern Club in nearby Liverpool .

 In 1830 , James Atherton purchased much of the land at Rock Point , in the north @-@ east corner of Wallasey opposite the city and docks of Liverpool . He renamed it New Brighton and organised its development as a tourist destination . In July 1896 a new group , the New Brighton Tower and Recreation Company , with a share capital of £ 300 @,@ 000 , purchased the estate of the demolished Rock Point House . Their ambition was to create an observation tower in the grounds , designed to rival the Blackpool Tower , while using the remaining grounds to create a more " elegant " atmosphere . The New Brighton Tower and Recreation Company had more than 20 acres ( 8 @.@ 1 ha ) of land available to construct the tower , which enabled them to include more attractions than at Blackpool Tower . 
 = = Construction = = 
 The company Maxwell and Tuke , who had designed Blackpool Tower buildings and Southport Winter Gardens , was responsible for overseeing and supervising the project , despite the deaths in 1893 of the company founders , James Maxwell and William Charles Tuke . The excavations and laying of the foundations for the tower were contracted to William Clapham of Stockport . The primary contractor for the tower was Andrew Handyside and Company , based in Derby . 
 The ground breaking happened on 22 June 1896 , before the formation of the new company , completion of land purchase and announcement of contracts on 26 July 1896 . The construction of the steel lattice tower started in July 1897 and was completed some time between 1898 and 1900 , 10 years after the Blackpool Tower had been finished . The grounds were opened before then for a short period in 1897 however . New Brighton Tower was the tallest building in England , standing 567 feet ( 173 m ) tall , and 621 feet ( 189 m ) above sea @-@ level . A total of 1000 tons ( 1 @,@ 016 @,@ 047 kg ) of mild or low @-@ carbon steel was used , at a cost of £ 120 @,@ 000 , in contrast to the earlier Blackpool and Eiffel towers , both constructed using wrought iron . The building below the New Brighton Tower , which was to contain the ballroom , was constructed by Peters and Sons of Rochdale . It was a four @-@ storey red @-@ brick building with arched windows and hexagonal , copper @-@ domed turrets . 
 A series of accidents during the tower 's construction resulted in the deaths of six workmen and serious injury to another . Two of the men , Jonathan Richardson and Alexander Stewart , were killed when a crane hook snapped and a girder fell and hit the scaffold platform on which they were standing , causing them to fall to the ground . A third man , John Daly , suffered serious injuries . The other four were killed in separate incidents by falling off the tower structure . A fire on the tower at 172 feet ( 52 m ) in 1898 resulted in the death of a fire @-@ fighter from the New Brighton Fire Brigade . He fell 90 feet ( 27 m ) while walking along a beam 6 @-@ inch ( 150 mm ) wide to try and extinguish the flames .

 New Brighton Tower regularly advertised itself as " the highest structure and finest place of amusement in the Kingdom " . A single entrance fee of one shilling ( or a ticket for the summer season , costing 10s 6d ) was charged for entrance into the grounds , which included the gardens , the athletic grounds , the ballroom and the theatre . An additional charge of sixpence was levied on those who wished to go to the top of the tower . There was a menagerie within the building , containing Nubian lions , Russian wolves ( which had eight cubs in 1914 ) , bears in a bear pit , monkeys , elephants , stags , leopards and other animals . There was also an aviary above the ballroom . The Tower Building also contained a shooting gallery and a billiard saloon with five tables . 
 Maxwell and Tuke clothed the entertainment buildings in hard @-@ wearing , red Ruabon brick with terracotta and stone dressings , and the plan of the buildings was octagonal , with the Tower , also built on an octagonal plan , at its centre . The roofline of the three @-@ to @-@ four @-@ storey building was dramatic , as four corners of the octagon were emphasised by tall pavilions with steeply pitched roofs topped by cupolas

 The tower had four lifts , each capable of reaching the top in 90 seconds and conveying up to 2000 people an hour . The views from the top included the Liverpool skyline , the River Mersey estuary and the River Dee . On a clear day visitors could see across the Irish Sea to the Isle of Man , along with views of the Lake District and Welsh Mountains . In its first year the tower attracted up to half a million visitors to the top . At night the tower was illuminated by fairy lights . 
 On 7 September 1909 two visitors were left stranded at the top of the tower as the final lift car of the night descended without them . The woman and twelve @-@ year @-@ old child were not noticed during the final round of inspection and so , without a way to communicate with anyone on the ground , they spent the night on the tower until 10 am the following morning . They did not appear too concerned by the ordeal and left without giving their names to officials . 
 = = = Tower Ballroom = = = 
 The ballroom had a sprung floor and dance band stage . It could accommodate more than a thousand couples dancing and had a separate area for couples to learn the dances before taking to the main floor . It was decorated in white and gold with emblems of Lancashire towns , and had balcony seating for spectators . 
 The composer Granville Bantock was enlisted as musical director in 1897 at the ballroom to provide music each weekday for six hours of ballroom dancing . To begin with , as the tower was being erected , he was in charge of a " semi @-@ military band " that played outdoors with the fear that the tower might fall upon him and his players . Bantock is quoted as saying , " The noise of the riveting of the tower while we were playing ... reminded me of the anvil music in Das Rheingold " . Bantock often played for the workmen during their lunch breaks , when they could frequently be heard saying , " play it again , <unk> <unk> " . 
 Soon , Granville had a full orchestra at his disposal , so he convinced the management committee to allow him to give classical concerts on Fridays and Sundays . He then embarked on advanced concerts of new composers , as well as his own works . As he had difficulty finding time to practice these works , Bantock used afternoon sessions , in which he was supposed to play dance music , to rehearse his classical pieces . When the classical pieces spread to the afternoon programme , the management felt it was not commercially viable to continue the concerts . After three years at the tower , Bantock was appointed Principal of the School of Music at Birmingham and Midland Institute . 
 The composer Edward Elgar conducted his Enigma Variations at the New Brighton Tower Ballroom in 1898 , the second time he performed the piece . In 1900 he conducted Tchaikovsky 's Pathétique symphony at New Brighton Tower . 
 The interior of the ballroom was completely destroyed by fire in 1956 , but it was restored in its original style and reopened two years later . 
 On 10 November 1961 , The Beatles played for an audience of 4 @,@ 000 people at the New Brighton Tower Ballroom as the headline act of a five @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half @-@ hour concert named Operation Big Beat . Rory Storm and the Hurricanes , Gerry and the Pacemakers , Remo Four and Kingsize Taylor and the Dominoes also performed at the concert . The Beatles played at the venue 27 times , commemorated in a blue plaque erected in New Brighton in 2011 . The only British venue The Beatles played at more often was the Cavern Club . Little Richard and the Rolling Stones also performed at the Tower Building . 
 = = = Tower Theatre = = = 
 On 30 May 1898 the Tower Theatre was opened , sited between the legs of the tower . Capable of accommodating an audience of 2 @,@ 500 , it was the largest theatre in England outside London . Each season at the theatre was different ; some years it would show a play or an opera , others it would focus on variety acts such as magicians , comedians and lion tamer Mademoiselle Marguerite , with her seven lions . Wrestling was hosted at the theatre as early as 1903 , and had become a weekly event by 1937 . When the Americans occupied the site during the Second World War they used the Tower Theatre to show their own roadshows to the troops . 
 = = Grounds = = 
 The tower 's grounds were enclosed by iron railings , and throughout the gardens the roads and paths were illuminated with 30 @,@ 000 red , white and green fairy lights at night . The tower 's grounds had a band stand , a dancing platform , a fountain , seal pond and tennis courts . The gardens were separated into wooded areas , rockeries and flower beds . There was a lake in the grounds , which had a 130 @-@ foot ( 40 m ) water chute and gondolas with Venetian gondoliers . There were also a number of venues providing refreshments , including a Japanese restaurant that could cater for up to 700 people , the Parisian Tea Garden , the Rock Point Castle restaurant , which could accommodate 400 people , and an Algerian café . 
 At the grounds of the tower there was a large permanent funfair , with rides including Figure of Eight , Wall Of Death , Donkey Derby , The Himalayan Switchback Railway and The Caterpillar . To give easy access from the promenade entrance to the tower , a chair lift was introduced . In 1898 – 99 an acrobat named Hardy performed for a season at the tower without a safety net and often without a balancing pole on the high wire 100 feet ( 30 m ) above the dancing platform . 
 = = = Tower Athletic Ground = = = 
 An area was set aside within the grounds for athletics , aptly named the Tower Athletic Ground . It consisted of a stadium opened in 1896 ; the hope was to provide additional entertainment for visitors to the tower in the winter months . The capacity of the grounds varied , but at one point was as high as 100 @,@ 000 , although attendances rarely , if ever , approached that figure . 
 The New Brighton Tower and Recreation Company formed a football team , New Brighton Tower F.C. , and applied for membership to the Lancashire League . The team joined at the start of the 1897 – 98 season and promptly won the league . The club then applied for election to the Football League . Although they were initially rejected , the league later decided to expand Division Two by four clubs and New Brighton Tower were accepted . They carried on playing until 1901 when the company disbanded the team as they did not gain the fan base they were hoping for and so it was no longer considered financially viable . 
 The Tower Athletic Grounds was a multi @-@ purpose stadium and ground that could be laid out for athletics field events . The field was encircled by an athletics track surrounded by a banked cycle track , which hosted the World Cycling championships in July 1922 . It was the biggest sporting and motorcycling track in the North of England . In 1933 , the athletics track was replaced for use every Saturday by motorcycle speedway racing . 
 Disaster struck the motorcycling in 1911 when T. Henshaw 's bike struck six spectators at around 50 miles per hour ( 80 km / h ) . This left Henshaw with serious fractures and one woman with a severe brain injury . In another incident on 18 May 1959 five people were injured while watching a motorcycling stunt when a 10 @-@ foot ( 3 @.@ 0 m ) wide section of stands collapsed , causing the spectators to fall 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) to the ground . 
 On 15 May 1919 a fire destroyed the grandstand . During the Second World War the United States Army took over the Tower Athletic Grounds as a storage facility for military vehicles to be used in the invasion of France . Following the war the stadium was reopened as the home ground for New Brighton A.F.C. , whose <unk> Park had been requisitioned for housing . They sold it to the Wallasey Housing Corporation in 1977 .

 In 1900 , New Brighton Tower athletic grounds boasted the UK 's first visit from a group known as The Ashanti Village , in which 100 West African men , women and children re @-@ created an Ashanti village , produced and sold their wares and performed " war tournaments , songs [ and ] fetish dances " . Although they had arrived , delays meant that they were not set up in time for Whitsun the traditional start of the summer season . As was common at fairgrounds of the time , there was a Bioscope exhibition showing the latest wartime pictures to audiences of up to 2 @,@ 000 . In the summer of 1907 there was a Hale 's Tours of the World exhibition in the tower 's grounds , consisting of short films shown in a stylised railway carriage with sound effects and movements at the appropriate times . 
 = = Closure = = 
 The tower was closed in 1914 following the outbreak of the First World War , for the duration of which the steel structure was not maintained and consequently became rusty . During the war the government made unsuccessful attempts to buy the tower for its metal . Controversy still surrounds the decision to dismantle the tower after the war ended ; some still believe the structure was safe and could have been repaired . Demolition began in 1919 and by 1921 only the ballroom remained . The metal was sold to scrap dealers . 
 On 5 April 1969 the ballroom was destroyed by fire , the cause of which is unknown . In place of the tower 's grounds , including the athletics ground and stadium , a new housing estate was built , River View Park , which has a community football pitch and swing park . 
 In 1997 Wirral Council made an unsuccessful bid for Millennium funding to build a new tower in New Brighton . 
 = Constitution of New Jersey = 
 The Constitution of the State of New Jersey is the basic governing document of the State of New Jersey . In addition to three British Royal Charters issued for East Jersey , West Jersey and united New Jersey while they were still colonies , the state has been governed by three constitutions . The first was issued on July 2 , 1776 , shortly before New Jersey ratified the United States Declaration of Independence and the second was issued in 1844 . The current document was issued in 1947 and has been amended several times . 
 The state constitution reinforces the basic rights found in the United States Constitution , but also contains several unique provisions , such as regulations governing the operation of casinos . At 26 @,@ 159 words , the document is slightly shorter than the average American state constitution ( about 28 @,@ 300 words ) . 
 = = Previous versions = = 
 Three fundamental documents had governed the territory now known as New Jersey . The first was the Concession and Agreement , which was written in 1665 by the colony 's proprietors Lord John Berkeley and Sir George Carteret , and included a provision granting religious freedom . After Berkeley and Carteret sold New Jersey to the Quakers , the colony was split into West and East Jersey . Each had its own constitution : the West Jersey Constitution ( 1681 ) and the East Jersey Constitution ( 1683 ) . The two were reunited in 1702 by Queen Anne . 
 New Jersey 's first state constitution was adopted on July 2 , 1776 . The American Revolutionary War was underway and George Washington had recently been defeated in New York , putting New Jersey in imminent danger of invasion . With Patriot and Tory factions plotting and battling each other , New Jersey was a state at war and was nearly a state at civil war . Composed in a span of five days and ratified only two days later , during this state of emergency , on July 2 , 1776 , the New Jersey State Constitution reflects the turbulence and uncertainty of the moment . Its primary objective was to provide a basic governmental framework that would preempt New Jersey 's fall into anarchy . And yet this Constitution served as the charter document for the State 's government for the next 68 years . 
 Among other provisions , it granted unmarried women and blacks who met property requirements the right to vote . It did not specify an amendment procedure and had to be replaced entirely in a constitutional convention . 
 The succeeding constitution , adopted on June 29 , 1844 , restricted suffrage to white males . It separated the government 's powers into judicial , legislative , and executive branches and granted the people ( as opposed to the legislature ) the ability to elect a governor . It also formally limited state debt , a predecessor of many contemporary " debt ceiling " clauses . The constitution was amended in 1875 , mainly to conform to the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments . Additionally , the state 's amendments required that the legislature provide for a free public school system .

 We , the people of the State of New Jersey , grateful to Almighty God for the civil and religious liberty which He hath so long permitted us to enjoy , and looking to Him for a blessing upon our endeavors to secure and transmit the same unimpaired to succeeding generations , do ordain and establish this Constitution . 
 = = = " Rights and Privileges " = = = 
 Article I , as is usual for constitutions , establishes the rights and freedoms inherent people and relevant operation of the government . The rights discussed in this Article largely mirror the Constitution of the United States . Such rights include freedom of speech , a speedy and public trial , and religious freedom . Article I also contains a Victims ' Bill of Rights . The article is a de facto enumeration of the rights of the common man ; Article I , Section I , Paragraph 21 deliberately states : 
 This Article is similar to the U.S. Constitution 's enumeration of rights . Similar to the U.S. Bill of Rights , the document also still has " holdover " rights , or rights left over from fear of Britain during the Revolutionary War . These passages still do guarantee important rights to New <unk> , but violations are not necessarily common . Such rights include : 
 = = = " Elections and Suffrage " = = = 
 Article II lays out dates for elections of the Governor , the Lieutenant Governor , and members of the New Jersey Legislature . It establishes the qualifications necessary for voting and states the right of suffrage may be removed from certain convicted criminals . The process of absentee balloting is instituted , as well as the structure of voting by people currently in military service . The New Jersey Redistricting Commission is established , and the distribution of selection of its 13 members is discussed , who are to represent the " geographic , ethnic and racial diversity " of the state . The method of appointment of New Jersey Redistricting Commission members ensures the minority party which lost the general election prior to the census will have the upper hand in redistricting the state . Along with the other 12 appointed members , there is one " independent " member , who is to not have held office within the past five years . He is chosen by the other twelve members , yet is automatically the chairman of the Commission . On the occasion that the twelve members may not reach a decision , the Commission picks two ( which assumes there are two dominant parties which have their favorites ) and sends them to the New Jersey Supreme Court . A majority of the court ( 4 of 7 ) then picks the one that " by education and occupational experience , by prior public service in government or otherwise , and by demonstrated ability to represent the best interest of the people of this State . " 
 = = = " Distribution of the Powers of Government " = = = 
 The sole content of Article III is the statement regarding separation of powers . The three branches ( executive , judicial , and legislative ) are created and defined . No individual can be affiliated with more than one unless the Constitution explicitly allows it . Before the constitution was amended , a vacancy in the Governor of New Jersey would be filled by the president of the New Jersey Senate , who would retain their Senate seat . 
 = = = " Legislative " = = = 
 Article IV establishes the bicameral New Jersey Legislature , composed of 40 in the Senate and 80 in the General Assembly , and their apportionment amongst the state . The Apportionment Commission is created within the Legislature to modify the <unk> of legislative districts on a rolling basis , following every United States Census . It also creates the requirements for office , and the roles of the Senate and General Assembly . This includes the judging of elections , the selection of officers , a journal of proceedings , and the inability to adjourn for a period of greater than three days without the consent of the other house . This article also allows the Legislature to appoint commissions , committees , and other bodies to help perform the functions of the Legislature . Regulations regarding members of the Legislature , including singularity of employment . This is the law that no senator or member of the General Assembly can hold any other Federal or State position , and also cannot be a judge . Further topics are discussed , including bills , agencies , subdivisions , and emergencies . A negative enumeration of legislative powers is included within the article . Among this list of powers denied are granting divorces , gambling ( with obvious exceptions ) , and passing omnibus acts . Although the phrase omnibus acts is never formally used in this document , the actual wording skirts around the phrase : 
 Finally , an oath / affirmation is included that is required by members and officers of the Legislature before the person enters upon his / her duties . 
 = = = " Executive " = = = 
 Article V enacts the executive branch . It also sets out the terms of office for the governor and lieutenant governor , the succession of future governors , and the process of gubernatorial elections . The Governor is given total authority over clemency except in cases of impeachment . This is to bar him from pardon in his own impeachment , or disturbing cases of treason . His clemency powers extend to the ability to suspend and remit fines and forfeitures . The system of granting parole is provided by law . The " militia " is created , or what is now the National Guard . Regulation regarding nominations and appointments of generals and flag offices is described . The executive and administrative offices , departments , and <unk> of the State government are placed under the supervision of the Governor . The Governor has the ability to appoint the Secretary of State and the Attorney General with the consent of the New Jersey Senate , though he also can appoint the Lieutenant Governor to serve as Secretary of State without consent of the Senate . He can also start inquiries into the conduct of officers and employees . 
 = = = " Judicial " = = = 
 Article VI creates the Judicial branch , and permits the establishment , alteration , and abolishment of any court other than the Supreme Court of New Jersey . Under the State Constitution , " ' judicial power shall be vested in a Supreme Court , a Superior Court , County Courts and inferior courts of limited jurisdiction . ' " 
 The Supreme Court is New Jersey 's appellate court of last resort . " By constitutional mandate , the Court consists of a Chief Justice and six associate justices , with five members constituting a quorum . " Article VI , Section II , Paragraph 3 provides that , " The Supreme Court makes its own rules governing the administration of all State courts ' and , subject to law , the practice and procedure of all such courts . ' " 
 The State Constitution renders the New Jersey Superior Court , Appellate Division the intermediate appellate court , and " [ a ] <unk> may be taken to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court from the law and chancery divisions of the Superior Court and in such other causes as may be provided by law . " 
 " The trial divisions of the Superior Court are the principal trial courts of New Jersey . They are located within the State 's various judicial geographic units , called ' <unk> , ' R. 1 : 33 @-@ 2 ( a ) , and are organized into two basic divisions : the Chancery Division and the Law Division " of the New Jersey Superior Court . 
 The Governor 's power to appoint and nominate the judges of the Supreme and Superior Courts , with the consent of the Senate , is established . He may also nominate and appoint , with the consent of the Senate , judges of the inferior courts whose jurisdiction is only within one municipality . The term of office of Justices and Judges , including their retirement ages and pensions , is stated . Impeachment of Justices and Judges is also legalized , and their <unk> of powers until acquitted . During their term , the judges are restricted to one public office and may not practice law outside the state government . The powers of the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court are enumerated . Terms specifying costs of the facilities and materials used by the Justice Department are listed . 
 = = = " Public Officers and Employees " = = = 
 Article VII involves the public officers and employees , including appointment / nomination , compensation , promotions , affirmations , and powers . The role of officers in the state government is discussed . Before the officer enters the duties of office , the officer must subscribe an oath . Appointments for officers are based upon merit , fitness , and examinations . Fees are paid to the New Jersey State Treasury . The term of office for an officer commences on the day of the date of their commissions . The Auditor , who has a term of five years , is to be appointed by the New Jersey Senate and New Jersey General Assembly . The rest of the section details the duties of the State Auditor and the nomination / appointment of county prosecutors , county clerks , surrogates , and sheriffs . County prosecutors are nominated and appointed by the Governor . The term of office for county clerks and surrogates is five years , and for sheriffs three years . Impeachment and the process by which impeachment occurs are discussed : 
 A state officer may be impeached while in office or for two years after leaving office . The impeachment process is similar to that of the Federal level : an absolute majority in the lower house ( the General Assembly ) against the employee causes a trial to take place in the upper house ( the State Senate ) with the Chief Justice presiding . Unlike the Federal process , the oath necessary to participate in the impeachment sessions is specified and requires the senators to " truly and impartially " address the charge as a reminder that they are exercising more judicial functions . ⅔ of the votes , or 27 votes , are needed to convict , but the President of the Senate is excluded from the trial , so the required percentage is slightly higher than ⅔ of 40 . The maximum penalty is removal from office with disqualification to hold further state office . However , the impeachment does not count towards the restriction on double jeopardy ; after being convicted by the senate , a person could then be tried by the judiciary and punished further . If this crime was listed according to Article II , Section I , Item 7 , the offender can be disenfranchised . 
 = = = " Taxation and Finance " = = = 
 In Article VIII , taxation is created . It states the Legislature 's duty to create laws " to provide the value of land " and the uniformity of these rules . Taxing of lands of agriculture is discussed , as well as taxation regulations regarding the re @-@ use of agricultural land for different purposes . Tax exemption is legalized , including the continued tax exemptions carried over from the previous constitution . Alteration or repeal of tax exemption is allowed , provided that the real or personal property is not used for " religious , educational , charitable or cemetery purposes , as defined by law , and owned by any corporation or association organized and conducted exclusively for one or more of such purposes and not operating for profit . " Tax exemptions regarding the honorably discharged and exemptions for senior citizens who live in apartments and may / may not be disabled are discussed . Pensions , disability , and retirement programs for federal railroad workers , or any state employees are described . Surviving spouses of deceased citizens , besides exceptions , are entitled to tax deductions . This article also restricts any citizen from receiving more than one tax deduction . The Legislature 's right to <unk> a homestead statue is discussed . General laws enacted by legislature which permit municipalities to grant tax exemptions on buildings in blighted urban areas are legalized , with exceptions relating to the deduction 's permanence . Income taxes are banned unless the revenue is placed into a specific perpetual fund , or if the <unk> is receiving payments from the Federal Railroad Retirement Act , or similar . 
 The credit of the state is barred from being publicly or privately loaned . Any fiscal year plan which creates more than one percent debt and / or liabilities is banned . The voting on such plans in public elections is banned , as well as the creation of debt or liabilities " for purposes of war , or to repel invasion , or to suppress insurrection or to meet an emergency caused by disaster or act of God . " Taxation of motor vehicle fuel , and the funds the moneys are deposited in are discussed ; the appropriation of moneys from the Sales and Use Tax Act are defined .

 Article XI , the schedule , is the list of amendments to the Constitution in order of their addition . Sections I through IV , were adopted with the rest of the constitution . They lay out the process of supersession . The others were adopted as individual amendments . The Article orders the Legislature to pass all laws necessary for the activation of the new constitution . Existing instruments of government , contracts , officers , and judgments are continued unless they are expired , superseded , altered , or repealed . This is to prevent application as an ex post facto law or violation of the Contract Clause , both prohibited by the United States Constitution . The new legislature members are elected , and the process of election , term , and rotation are created . The members may be appointed to offices of government , likely new ones created at the behest of Article XI , Section I , Paragraph 2 . 
 The remaining sections are the amendments . For reasons unknown , this constitution has never been directly updated since its adoption . The amendments are enumerated in this Article . Essentially , this section of the article records the development of the constitution through amendments . Such amendments include the abolishment of the New Jersey Court of Errors and Appeals and Chancery , transferring the cases before them and offices under the other courts , such as the New Jersey Supreme Court . 
 The requirement of the Federal Supreme Court that the apportionment of all state legislatures be by population is stated . It mainly consists of an interim list of districts and the number of Senators they can elect until the next United States Census comes around and is received by the Governor . It also contains provisions for apportioning ten districts of the lower house . If it is deadlocked , the Chief Justice of the New Jersey Supreme Court will appoint an 11th and then the vote is by absolute majority . It was passed on election day , 1966 , but was first applied on January 17 , 2006 . This was superseded in 1995 by Article II , Section II . It took effect on December 7 , 1978 . Section VII , the final section of this constitution , was passed in a referendum on November 8 , 2005 , and takes full effect at noon , January 19 , 2010 , following the transfer of power to the next executive . 
 = = Criticisms = = 
 The New Jersey State Constitution has been criticized , mainly for its disorganized succession plan , as seen following Jim McGreevey 's resignation . Senate President Richard Codey assumed command , and since he legally held both positions , he temporarily had more power than any other governor in the country , being the head of both Executive and Legislative branches . An amendment was later passed to prevent the possibility of Executive and Legislative conflation in the future . The constitution has also been denounced for its unorganized composition . Paragraphs traditionally in Article I , e.g. , the banning of ex post facto laws , are in Article IV " Legislative . " 
 = Galileo Galilei = 
 Galileo Galilei ( Italian pronunciation : [ <unk> <unk> ] ; 15 February 1564 – 8 January 1642 ) was an Italian astronomer , physicist , engineer , philosopher , and mathematician who played a major role in the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century . He has been called the " father of observational astronomy " , the " father of modern physics " , and the " father of science " . His contributions to observational astronomy include the telescopic confirmation of the phases of Venus , the discovery of the four largest satellites of Jupiter ( named the Galilean moons in his honour ) , and the observation and analysis of sunspots . Galileo also worked in applied science and technology , inventing an improved military compass and other instruments . 
 Galileo 's championing of heliocentrism and Copernicanism was controversial during his lifetime , when most subscribed to either geocentrism or the Tychonic system . He met with opposition from astronomers , who doubted heliocentrism because of the absence of an observed stellar parallax . The matter was investigated by the Roman Inquisition in 1615 , which concluded that heliocentrism was " foolish and absurd in philosophy , and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of Holy Scripture . " Galileo later defended his views in Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems , which appeared to attack Pope Urban VIII and thus alienated him and the Jesuits , who had both supported Galileo up until this point . He was tried by the Inquisition , found " vehemently suspect of heresy " , and forced to recant . He spent the rest of his life under house arrest . While under house arrest , he wrote one of his best @-@ known works , Two New Sciences , in which he summarized work he had done some forty years earlier on the two sciences now called kinematics and strength of materials . 
 = = Early life and family = = 
 Galileo was born in Pisa ( then part of the Duchy of Florence ) , Italy , in 1564 , the first of six children of Vincenzo Galilei , a famous lutenist , composer , and music theorist , and Giulia Ammannati . Galileo became an accomplished lutenist himself and would have learned early from his father a scepticism for established authority , the value of well @-@ measured or quantified experimentation , an appreciation for a periodic or musical measure of time or rhythm , as well as the results expected from a combination of mathematics and experiment . 
 Three of Galileo 's five siblings survived infancy . The youngest , Michelangelo ( or <unk> ) , also became a noted lutenist and composer although he contributed to financial burdens during Galileo 's young adulthood . Michelangelo was unable to contribute his fair share of their father 's promised dowries to their brothers @-@ in @-@ law , who would later attempt to seek legal remedies for payments due . Michelangelo would also occasionally have to borrow funds from Galileo to support his musical endeavours and excursions . These financial burdens may have contributed to Galileo 's early fire to develop inventions that would bring him additional income . 
 When Galileo Galilei was eight , his family moved to Florence , but he was left with Jacopo Borghini for two years . He then was educated in the Camaldolese Monastery at Vallombrosa , 35 km southeast of Florence . 
 = = = Name = = = 
 The surname Galilei derives from the given name of an ancestor , Galileo Bonaiuti , a physician , university teacher and politician who lived in Florence from 1370 to 1450 ; his descendents had changed their family name from Bonaiuti ( or <unk> ) to Galilei in his honor in the late 14th century . Galileo Bonaiuti was buried in the same church , the Basilica of Santa Croce in Florence , where about 200 years later his more famous descendant Galileo Galilei was also buried . 
 It was common for mid @-@ sixteenth century Tuscan families to name the eldest son after the parents ' surname - hence , Galileo Galilei was not necessarily named after his ancestor Galileo Bonaiuti . The Italian male given name " Galileo " ( and thence the surname " Galilei " ) derives from the Latin " <unk> " , meaning " of Galilee " , a biblically significant region in Northern Israel . 
 The biblical roots of Galileo 's name and surname were to become the subject of a famous pun . In 1614 , during the Galileo affair , one of Galileo 's opponents , the Dominican priest Tommaso Caccini , delivered against Galileo a controversial and influential sermon . In it he made a point of quoting Acts 1 : 11 , " Ye Men of Galilee , why stand you gazing up in heaven ? " . 
 = = = Children = = = 
 Despite being a genuinely pious Roman Catholic , Galileo fathered three children out of wedlock with Marina Gamba . They had two daughters , Virginia ( born in 1600 ) and Livia ( born in 1601 ) , and a son , Vincenzo ( born in 1606 ) . 
 Because of their illegitimate birth , their father considered the girls unmarriageable , if not posing problems of prohibitively expensive support or dowries , which would have been similar to Galileo 's previous extensive financial problems with two of his sisters . Their only worthy alternative was the religious life . Both girls were accepted by the convent of San Matteo in Arcetri and remained there for the rest of their lives . Virginia took the name Maria Celeste upon entering the convent . She died on 2 April 1634 , and is buried with Galileo at the Basilica of Santa Croce , Florence . Livia took the name Sister <unk> and was ill for most of her life . Vincenzo was later legitimised as the legal heir of Galileo and married <unk> <unk> . 
 = = Career as a scientist = = 
 Although Galileo seriously considered the priesthood as a young man , at his father 's urging he instead enrolled at the University of Pisa for a medical degree . In 1581 , when he was studying medicine , he noticed a swinging chandelier , which air currents shifted about to swing in larger and smaller arcs . To him it seemed , by comparison with his heartbeat , that the chandelier took the same amount of time to swing back and forth , no matter how far it was swinging . When he returned home , he set up two pendulums of equal length and swung one with a large sweep and the other with a small sweep and found that they kept time together . It was not until the work of Christiaan Huygens , almost one hundred years later , that the <unk> nature of a swinging pendulum was used to create an accurate timepiece . Up to this point , Galileo had deliberately been kept away from mathematics , since a physician earned a higher income than a mathematician . However , after accidentally attending a lecture on geometry , he talked his reluctant father into letting him study mathematics and natural philosophy instead of medicine . He created a <unk> , a forerunner of the thermometer , and in 1586 published a small book on the design of a hydrostatic balance he had invented ( which first brought him to the attention of the scholarly world ) . Galileo also studied <unk> , a term encompassing fine art , and in 1588 obtained the position of instructor in the Accademia delle Arti del <unk> in Florence , teaching perspective and chiaroscuro . Being inspired by the artistic tradition of the city and the works of the Renaissance artists , Galileo acquired an aesthetic mentality . While a young teacher at the Accademia , he began a lifelong friendship with the Florentine painter <unk> , who included Galileo 's lunar observations in one of his paintings . 
 In 1589 , he was appointed to the chair of mathematics in Pisa . In 1591 , his father died , and he was entrusted with the care of his younger brother <unk> . In 1592 , he moved to the University of Padua where he taught geometry , mechanics , and astronomy until 1610 . During this period , Galileo made significant discoveries in both pure fundamental science ( for example , kinematics of motion and astronomy ) as well as practical applied science ( for example , strength of materials and pioneering the telescope ) . His multiple interests included the study of astrology , which at the time was a discipline tied to the studies of mathematics and astronomy . 
 = = = Galileo , Kepler and theories of tides = = = 
 Cardinal Bellarmine had written in 1615 that the Copernican system could not be defended without " a true physical demonstration that the sun does not circle the earth but the earth circles the sun " . Galileo considered his theory of the tides to provide the required physical proof of the motion of the earth . This theory was so important to him that he originally intended to entitle his Dialogue on the Two Chief World Systems the Dialogue on the Ebb and Flow of the Sea . The reference to tides was removed from the title by order of the Inquisition . 
 For Galileo , the tides were caused by the sloshing back and forth of water in the seas as a point on the Earth 's surface sped up and slowed down because of the Earth 's rotation on its axis and revolution around the Sun . He circulated his first account of the tides in 1616 , addressed to Cardinal Orsini . His theory gave the first insight into the importance of the shapes of ocean basins in the size and timing of tides ; he correctly accounted , for instance , for the negligible tides halfway along the Adriatic Sea compared to those at the ends . As a general account of the cause of tides , however , his theory was a failure . 
 If this theory were correct , there would be only one high tide per day . Galileo and his contemporaries were aware of this inadequacy because there are two daily high tides at Venice instead of one , about twelve hours apart . Galileo dismissed this anomaly as the result of several secondary causes including the shape of the sea , its depth , and other factors . Against the assertion that Galileo was deceptive in making these arguments , Albert Einstein expressed the opinion that Galileo developed his " fascinating arguments " and accepted them uncritically out of a desire for physical proof of the motion of the Earth . Galileo dismissed the idea , held by his contemporary Johannes Kepler , that the moon caused the tides . ( Galileo also took no interest in Kepler 's elliptical orbits of the planets . ) 
 = = = Controversy over comets and The Assayer = = = 
 In 1619 , Galileo became embroiled in a controversy with Father Orazio Grassi , professor of mathematics at the Jesuit Collegio Romano . It began as a dispute over the nature of comets , but by the time Galileo had published The Assayer ( Il Saggiatore ) in 1623 , his last salvo in the dispute , it had become a much wider controversy over the very nature of science itself . The title page of the book describes Galileo as philosopher and " <unk> <unk> " of the Grand Duke of Tuscany . 
 Because The Assayer contains such a wealth of Galileo 's ideas on how science should be practised , it has been referred to as his scientific manifesto . Early in 1619 , Father Grassi had anonymously published a pamphlet , An Astronomical Disputation on the Three Comets of the Year 1618 , which discussed the nature of a comet that had appeared late in November of the previous year . Grassi concluded that the comet was a fiery body which had moved along a segment of a great circle at a constant distance from the earth , and since it moved in the sky more slowly than the moon , it must be farther away than the moon . 
 Grassi 's arguments and conclusions were criticised in a subsequent article , Discourse on the Comets , published under the name of one of Galileo 's disciples , a Florentine lawyer named Mario Guiducci , although it had been largely written by Galileo himself . Galileo and Guiducci offered no definitive theory of their own on the nature of comets although they did present some tentative conjectures that are now known to be mistaken . In its opening passage , Galileo and Guiducci 's Discourse gratuitously insulted the Jesuit Christopher Scheiner , and various uncomplimentary remarks about the professors of the Collegio Romano were scattered throughout the work . The Jesuits were offended , and Grassi soon replied with a polemical tract of his own , The Astronomical and Philosophical Balance , under the pseudonym Lothario <unk> <unk> , purporting to be one of his own pupils . 
 The Assayer was Galileo 's devastating reply to the Astronomical Balance . It has been widely recognized as a masterpiece of polemical literature , in which " <unk> 's " arguments are subjected to withering scorn . It was greeted with wide acclaim , and particularly pleased the new pope , Urban VIII , to whom it had been dedicated . In Rome , in the previous decade , Barberini , the future Urban VIII , had come down on the side of Galileo and the <unk> Academy . 
 Galileo 's dispute with Grassi permanently alienated many of the Jesuits who had previously been sympathetic to his ideas , and Galileo and his friends were convinced that these Jesuits were responsible for bringing about his later condemnation . The evidence for this is at best equivocal , however . 
 = = = Controversy over heliocentrism = = = 
 In the Christian world prior to Galileo 's conflict with the Church , the majority of educated people subscribed either to the Aristotelian geocentric view that the earth was the center of the universe and that all heavenly bodies revolved around the Earth , or the Tychonic system that blended <unk> with heliocentrism . Nevertheless , following the death of Copernicus and before Galileo , heliocentrism was relatively uncontroversial ; Copernicus 's work was used by Pope Gregory XIII to reform the calendar in 1582 . 
 Opposition to heliocentrism and Galileo 's writings combined religious and scientific objections and were fueled by political events . Scientific opposition came from Tycho Brahe and others , and arose from the fact that , if heliocentrism were true , an annual stellar parallax should be observed , though none was . Copernicus had correctly postulated that parallax was negligible because the stars were so distant . However , Brahe had countered that , since stars appeared to have measurable size , if the stars were that distant , they would be gigantic , and in fact far larger than the Sun or any other celestial body . In Brahe 's system , by contrast , the stars were a little more distant than Saturn , and the Sun and stars were comparable in size . 
 Religious opposition to heliocentrism arose from Biblical references such as Psalm 93 : 1 , 96 : 10 , and 1 Chronicles 16 : 30 which include text stating that " the world is firmly established , it cannot be moved . " In the same manner , Psalm 104 : 5 says , " the Lord set the earth on its foundations ; it can never be moved . " Further , Ecclesiastes 1 : 5 states that " And the sun rises and sets and returns to its place . " 
 Galileo defended heliocentrism based on his astronomical observations of 1609 ( Sidereus Nuncius 1610 ) . In December 1613 the Grand Duchess Christina of Florence confronted one of Galileo 's friends and followers , Benedetto Castelli , with biblical objections to the motion of the earth . According to Maurice Finocchiaro this was done in a friendly and gracious manner , out of curiosity . Prompted by this incident , Galileo wrote a letter to Castelli in which he argued that heliocentrism was actually not contrary to biblical texts , and that the bible was an authority on faith and morals , not on science . This letter was not published , but circulated widely . 
 By 1615 Galileo 's writings on heliocentrism had been submitted to the Roman Inquisition by Father Niccolo <unk> , who claimed that Galileo and his followers were attempting to reinterpret the Bible , which was seen as a violation of the Council of Trent and looked dangerously like Protestantism . <unk> specifically cited Galileo 's letter to Castelli . Galileo went to Rome to defend himself and his Copernican and biblical ideas . At the start of 1616 , Monsignor Francesco Ingoli initiated a debate with Galileo , sending him an essay disputing the Copernican system . Galileo later stated that he believed this essay to have been instrumental in the action against Copernicanism that followed . According to Maurice Finocchiaro , Ingoli had probably been commissioned by the Inquisition to write an expert opinion on the controversy , and the essay provided the " chief direct basis " for the Inquisition 's actions . The essay focused on eighteen physical and mathematical arguments against heliocentrism . It borrowed primarily from the arguments of Tycho Brahe , and it <unk> mentioned Brahe 's argument that heliocentrism required the stars to be much larger than the Sun . Ingoli wrote that the great distance to the stars in the heliocentric theory " clearly proves ... the fixed stars to be of such size , as they may surpass or equal the size of the orbit circle of the Earth itself . " The essay also included four theological arguments , but Ingoli suggested Galileo focus on the physical and mathematical arguments , and he did not mention Galileo 's biblical ideas . In February 1616 , an Inquisitorial commission declared heliocentrism to be " foolish and absurd in philosophy , and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of Holy Scripture . " The Inquisition found that the idea of the Earth 's movement " receives the same judgement in philosophy and ... in regard to theological truth it is at least erroneous in faith " . ( The original document from the Inquisitorial commission was made widely available in 2014 . ) 
 Pope Paul V instructed Cardinal Bellarmine to deliver this finding to Galileo , and to order him to abandon the opinion that heliocentrism was physically true . On 26 February , Galileo was called to Bellarmine 's residence and ordered : 
 ... to abandon completely ... the opinion that the sun stands still at the center of the world and the earth moves , and henceforth not to hold , teach , or defend it in any way whatever , either orally or in writing . 
 The decree of the Congregation of the Index banned Copernicus 's De Revolutionibus and other heliocentric works until correction . Bellarmine 's instructions did not prohibit Galileo from discussing heliocentrism as a mathematical and philosophic idea , so long as he did not advocate for its physical truth . 
 For the next decade , Galileo stayed well away from the controversy . He revived his project of writing a book on the subject , encouraged by the election of Cardinal Maffeo Barberini as Pope Urban VIII in 1623 . Barberini was a friend and admirer of Galileo , and had opposed the condemnation of Galileo in 1616 . Galileo 's resulting book , Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems , was published in 1632 , with formal authorization from the Inquisition and papal permission . 
 Earlier , Pope Urban VIII had personally asked Galileo to give arguments for and against heliocentrism in the book , and to be careful not to advocate heliocentrism . He made another request , that his own views on the matter be included in Galileo 's book . Only the latter of those requests was fulfilled by Galileo . 
 Whether unknowingly or deliberately , Simplicio , the defender of the Aristotelian geocentric view in Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems , was often caught in his own errors and sometimes came across as a fool . Indeed , although Galileo states in the preface of his book that the character is named after a famous Aristotelian philosopher ( Simplicius in Latin , " Simplicio " in Italian ) , the name " Simplicio " in Italian also has the connotation of " simpleton " . This portrayal of Simplicio made Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems appear as an advocacy book : an attack on Aristotelian geocentrism and defence of the Copernican theory . Unfortunately for his relationship with the Pope , Galileo put the words of Urban VIII into the mouth of Simplicio . 
 Most historians agree Galileo did not act out of malice and felt blindsided by the reaction to his book . However , the Pope did not take the suspected public ridicule lightly , nor the Copernican advocacy . 
 Galileo had alienated one of his biggest and most powerful supporters , the Pope , and was called to Rome to defend his writings in September 1632 . He finally arrived in February 1633 and was brought before inquisitor Vincenzo <unk> to be charged . Throughout his trial Galileo steadfastly maintained that since 1616 he had faithfully kept his promise not to hold any of the condemned opinions , and initially he denied even defending them . However , he was eventually persuaded to admit that , contrary to his true intention , a reader of his Dialogue could well have obtained the impression that it was intended to be a defence of Copernicanism . In view of Galileo 's rather implausible denial that he had ever held Copernican ideas after 1616 or ever intended to defend them in the Dialogue , his final interrogation , in July 1633 , concluded with his being threatened with torture if he did not tell the truth , but he maintained his denial despite the threat . 
 The sentence of the Inquisition was delivered on 22 June . It was in three essential parts : 
 Galileo was found " vehemently suspect of heresy " , namely of having held the opinions that the Sun lies motionless at the centre of the universe , that the Earth is not at its centre and moves , and that one may hold and defend an opinion as probable after it has been declared contrary to Holy Scripture . He was required to " abjure , curse and detest " those opinions . 
 He was sentenced to formal imprisonment at the pleasure of the Inquisition . On the following day this was commuted to house arrest , which he remained under for the rest of his life . 
 His offending Dialogue was banned ; and in an action not announced at the trial , publication of any of his works was forbidden , including any he might write in the future . 
 According to popular legend , after recanting his theory that the Earth moved around the Sun , Galileo allegedly muttered the rebellious phrase And yet it moves . A 1640s painting by the Spanish painter Bartolomé Esteban Murillo or an artist of his school , in which the words were hidden until restoration work in 1911 , depicts an imprisoned Galileo apparently gazing at the words " E pur si muove " written on the wall of his dungeon . The earliest known written account of the legend dates to a century after his death , but Stillman Drake writes " there is no doubt now that the famous words were already attributed to Galileo before his death " . 
 After a period with the friendly Ascanio Piccolomini ( the Archbishop of Siena ) , Galileo was allowed to return to his villa at Arcetri near Florence in 1634 , where he spent the remainder of his life under house arrest . Galileo was ordered to read the seven penitential psalms once a week for the next three years . However , his daughter Maria Celeste relieved him of the burden after securing ecclesiastical permission to take it upon herself . 
 It was while Galileo was under house arrest that he dedicated his time to one of his finest works , Two New Sciences . Here he summarised work he had done some forty years earlier , on the two sciences now called kinematics and strength of materials , published in Holland to avoid the censor . This book has received high praise from Albert Einstein . As a result of this work , Galileo is often called the " father of modern physics " . He went completely blind in 1638 and was suffering from a painful hernia and insomnia , so he was permitted to travel to Florence for medical advice . 
 Dava Sobel argues that prior to Galileo 's 1633 trial and judgement for heresy , Pope Urban VIII had become preoccupied with court intrigue and problems of state , and began to fear persecution or threats to his own life . In this context , Sobel argues that the problem of Galileo was presented to the pope by court insiders and enemies of Galileo . Having been accused of weakness in defending the church , Urban reacted against Galileo out of anger and fear . 
 = = Death = = 
 Galileo continued to receive visitors until 1642 , when , after suffering fever and heart palpitations , he died on 8 January 1642 , aged 77 . The Grand Duke of Tuscany , Ferdinando II , wished to bury him in the main body of the Basilica of Santa Croce , next to the tombs of his father and other ancestors , and to erect a marble mausoleum in his honour . 
 These plans were dropped , however , after Pope Urban VIII and his nephew , Cardinal Francesco Barberini , protested , because Galileo had been condemned by the Catholic Church for " vehement suspicion of heresy " . He was instead buried in a small room next to the novices ' chapel at the end of a corridor from the southern transept of the basilica to the sacristy . He was reburied in the main body of the basilica in 1737 after a monument had been erected there in his honour ; during this move , three fingers and a tooth were removed from his remains . One of these fingers , the middle finger from Galileo 's right hand , is currently on exhibition at the Museo Galileo in Florence , Italy . 
 = = Scientific methods = = 
 Galileo made original contributions to the science of motion through an innovative combination of experiment and mathematics . More typical of science at the time were the qualitative studies of William Gilbert , on magnetism and electricity . Galileo 's father , Vincenzo Galilei , a lutenist and music theorist , had performed experiments establishing perhaps the oldest known non @-@ linear relation in physics : for a stretched string , the pitch varies as the square root of the tension . These observations lay within the framework of the Pythagorean tradition of music , well @-@ known to instrument makers , which included the fact that subdividing a string by a whole number produces a harmonious scale . Thus , a limited amount of mathematics had long related music and physical science , and young Galileo could see his own father 's observations expand on that tradition . 
 Galileo was one of the first modern thinkers to clearly state that the laws of nature are mathematical . In The Assayer he wrote " Philosophy is written in this grand book , the universe ... It is written in the language of mathematics , and its characters are triangles , circles , and other geometric figures ; .... " His mathematical analyses are a further development of a tradition employed by late scholastic natural philosophers , which Galileo learned when he studied philosophy . His work marked another step towards the eventual separation of science from both philosophy and religion ; a major development in human thought . He was often willing to change his views in accordance with observation . In order to perform his experiments , Galileo had to set up standards of length and time , so that measurements made on different days and in different laboratories could be compared in a reproducible fashion . This provided a reliable foundation on which to confirm mathematical laws using inductive reasoning . 
 Galileo showed a modern appreciation for the proper relationship between mathematics , theoretical physics , and experimental physics . He understood the parabola , both in terms of conic sections and in terms of the ordinate ( y ) varying as the square of the <unk> ( x ) . Galilei further asserted that the parabola was the theoretically ideal trajectory of a uniformly accelerated projectile in the absence of air resistance or other disturbances . He conceded that there are limits to the validity of this theory , noting on theoretical grounds that a projectile trajectory of a size comparable to that of the Earth could not possibly be a parabola , but he nevertheless maintained that for distances up to the range of the artillery of his day , the deviation of a projectile 's trajectory from a parabola would be only very slight . 
 = = Astronomy = = 
 Based only on uncertain descriptions of the first practical telescope which Hans Lippershey tried to patent in the Netherlands in 1608 , Galileo , in the following year , made a telescope with about 3x magnification . He later made improved versions with up to about <unk> magnification . With a Galilean telescope , the observer could see magnified , upright images on the earth — it was what is commonly known as a terrestrial telescope or a spyglass . He could also use it to observe the sky ; for a time he was one of those who could construct telescopes good enough for that purpose . On 25 August 1609 , he demonstrated one of his early telescopes , with a magnification of about 8 or 9 , to Venetian lawmakers . His telescopes were also a profitable sideline for Galileo , who sold them to merchants who found them useful both at sea and as items of trade . He published his initial telescopic astronomical observations in March 1610 in a brief treatise entitled Sidereus Nuncius ( Starry Messenger ) . 
 = = = Kepler 's supernova = = = 
 Tycho and others had observed the supernova of 1572 . Ottavio <unk> 's letter of 15 January 1605 to Galileo brought the 1572 supernova and the less bright nova of 1601 to Galileo 's notice . Galileo observed and discussed Kepler 's supernova in 1604 . Since these new stars displayed no detectable diurnal parallax , Galileo concluded that they were distant stars , and therefore disproved the Aristotelian belief in the immutability of the heavens . 
 = = = Jupiter = = = 
 On 7 January 1610 , Galileo observed with his telescope what he described at the time as " three fixed stars , totally invisible by their smallness " , all close to Jupiter , and lying on a straight line through it . Observations on subsequent nights showed that the positions of these " stars " relative to Jupiter were changing in a way that would have been inexplicable if they had really been fixed stars . On 10 January , Galileo noted that one of them had disappeared , an observation which he attributed to its being hidden behind Jupiter . Within a few days , he concluded that they were orbiting Jupiter : he had discovered three of Jupiter 's four largest satellites ( moons ) . He discovered the fourth on 13 January . Galileo named the group of four the Medicean stars , in honour of his future patron , Cosimo II de ' Medici , Grand Duke of Tuscany , and Cosimo 's three brothers . Later astronomers , however , renamed them Galilean satellites in honour of their discoverer . These satellites are now called Io , Europa , Ganymede , and Callisto . 
 His observations of the satellites of Jupiter caused a revolution in astronomy : a planet with smaller planets orbiting it did not conform to the principles of Aristotelian cosmology , which held that all heavenly bodies should circle the Earth , and many astronomers and philosophers initially refused to believe that Galileo could have discovered such a thing . His observations were confirmed by the observatory of Christopher Clavius and he received a hero 's welcome when he visited Rome in 1611 . Galileo continued to observe the satellites over the next eighteen months , and by mid @-@ 1611 , he had obtained remarkably accurate estimates for their periods — a feat which Kepler had believed impossible . 
 = = = Venus , Saturn , and Neptune = = = 
 From September 1610 , Galileo observed that Venus exhibited a full set of phases similar to that of the Moon . The heliocentric model of the solar system developed by Nicolaus Copernicus predicted that all phases would be visible since the orbit of Venus around the Sun would cause its illuminated hemisphere to face the Earth when it was on the opposite side of the Sun and to face away from the Earth when it was on the Earth @-@ side of the Sun . On the other hand , in Ptolemy 's geocentric model it was impossible for any of the planets ' orbits to intersect the spherical shell carrying the Sun . Traditionally the orbit of Venus was placed entirely on the near side of the Sun , where it could exhibit only crescent and new phases . It was , however , also possible to place it entirely on the far side of the Sun , where it could exhibit only gibbous and full phases . After Galileo 's telescopic observations of the crescent , gibbous and full phases of Venus , therefore , this Ptolemaic model became untenable . Thus in the early 17th century as a result of his discovery the great majority of astronomers converted to one of the various geo @-@ heliocentric planetary models , such as the Tychonic , <unk> and Extended <unk> models , each either with or without a daily rotating Earth . These all had the virtue of explaining the phases of Venus without the vice of the ' refutation ' of full heliocentrism 's prediction of stellar parallax . Galileo 's discovery of the phases of Venus was thus arguably his most empirically practically influential contribution to the two @-@ stage transition from full geocentrism to full heliocentrism via geo @-@ heliocentrism . 
 Galileo observed the planet Saturn , and at first mistook its rings for planets , thinking it was a three @-@ bodied system . When he observed the planet later , Saturn 's rings were directly oriented at Earth , causing him to think that two of the bodies had disappeared . The rings reappeared when he observed the planet in 1616 , further confusing him . 
 Galileo also observed the planet Neptune in 1612 . It appears in his notebooks as one of many unremarkable dim stars . He did not realise that it was a planet , but he did note its motion relative to the stars before losing track of it . 
 = = = Sunspots = = = 
 Galileo was one of the first Europeans to observe sunspots , although Kepler had unwittingly observed one in 1607 , but mistook it for a transit of Mercury . He also reinterpreted a sunspot observation from the time of Charlemagne , which formerly had been attributed ( impossibly ) to a transit of Mercury . The very existence of sunspots showed another difficulty with the unchanging perfection of the heavens as posited in orthodox Aristotelian celestial physics . And the annual variations in sunspots ' motions , discovered by Francesco <unk> and others in 1612 – 1613 , provided a powerful argument against both the Ptolemaic system and the <unk> system of Tycho Brahe . A dispute over priority in the discovery of sunspots , and in their interpretation , led Galileo to a long and bitter feud with the Jesuit Christoph Scheiner . 
 In fact , there is little doubt that both of them were beaten by David Fabricius and his son Johannes . Scheiner quickly adopted Kepler 's 1615 proposal of the modern telescope design , which gave larger magnification at the cost of inverted images ; Galileo apparently never changed to Kepler 's design . 
 = = = Moon = = = 
 Prior to Galileo 's construction of his version of a telescope , Thomas Harriot , an English mathematician and explorer , had already used what he dubbed a " perspective tube " to observe the moon . Reporting his observations , Harriot noted only " strange <unk> " in the waning of the crescent , but was ignorant to the cause . Galileo , due in part to his artistic training and the knowledge of chiaroscuro , had understood the patterns of light and shadow were in fact topographical markers . While not being the only one to observe the moon through a telescope , Galileo was the first to deduce the cause of the uneven waning as light occlusion from lunar mountains and craters . In his study he also made topographical charts , estimating the heights of the mountains . The moon was not what was long thought to have been a translucent and perfect sphere , as Aristotle claimed , and hardly the first " planet " , an " eternal pearl to magnificently ascend into the heavenly <unk> " , as put forth by Dante . 
 = = = Milky Way and stars = = = 
 Galileo observed the Milky Way , previously believed to be nebulous , and found it to be a multitude of stars packed so densely that they appeared from Earth to be clouds . He located many other stars too distant to be visible with the naked eye . He observed the double star Mizar in Ursa Major in 1617 . 
 In the Starry Messenger , Galileo reported that stars appeared as mere blazes of light , essentially unaltered in appearance by the telescope , and contrasted them to planets , which the telescope revealed to be discs . But shortly thereafter , in his letters on sunspots , he reported that the telescope revealed the shapes of both stars and planets to be " quite round " . From that point forward , he continued to report that telescopes showed the roundness of stars , and that stars seen through the telescope measured a few seconds of arc in diameter . He also devised a method for measuring the apparent size of a star without a telescope . As described in his Dialogue Concerning the two Chief World Systems , his method was to hang a thin rope in his line of sight to the star and measure the maximum distance from which it would wholly obscure the star . From his measurements of this distance and of the width of the rope , he could calculate the angle subtended by the star at his viewing point . In his Dialogue , he reported that he had found the apparent diameter of a star of first magnitude to be no more than 5 arcseconds , and that of one of sixth magnitude to be about 5 / 6 arcseconds . Like most astronomers of his day , Galileo did not recognise that the apparent sizes of stars that he measured were spurious , caused by diffraction and atmospheric distortion ( see seeing disk or Airy disk ) , and did not represent the true sizes of stars . However , Galileo 's values were much smaller than previous estimates of the apparent sizes of the brightest stars , such as those made by Tycho Brahe ( see Magnitude ) and enabled Galileo to counter anti @-@ Copernican arguments such as those made by Tycho that these stars would have to be absurdly large for their annual parallaxes to be undetectable . Other astronomers such as Simon Marius , Giovanni Battista Riccioli , and Martinus Hortensius made similar measurements of stars , and Marius and Riccioli concluded the smaller sizes were not small enough to answer Tycho 's argument .

 Galileo made a number of contributions to what is now known as engineering , as distinct from pure physics . Between 1595 and 1598 , Galileo devised and improved a Geometric and Military Compass suitable for use by gunners and surveyors . This expanded on earlier instruments designed by Niccolò Tartaglia and <unk> del Monte . For gunners , it offered , in addition to a new and safer way of elevating cannons accurately , a way of quickly computing the charge of gunpowder for cannonballs of different sizes and materials . As a geometric instrument , it enabled the construction of any regular polygon , computation of the area of any polygon or circular sector , and a variety of other calculations . Under Galileo 's direction , instrument maker Marc 'Antonio Mazzoleni produced more than 100 of these compasses , which Galileo sold ( along with an instruction manual he wrote ) for 50 lire and offered a course of instruction in the use of the compasses for 120 lire . 
 In about 1593 , Galileo constructed a thermometer , using the expansion and contraction of air in a bulb to move water in an attached tube . 
 In 1609 , Galileo was , along with Englishman Thomas Harriot and others , among the first to use a refracting telescope as an instrument to observe stars , planets or moons . The name " telescope " was coined for Galileo 's instrument by a Greek mathematician , Giovanni <unk> , at a banquet held in 1611 by Prince Federico Cesi to make Galileo a member of his Accademia dei Lincei . The name was derived from the Greek tele 
 = ' far ' and <unk> = 
 <unk> look or see ' . In 1610 , he used a telescope at close range to magnify the parts of insects . By 1624 Galileo had used a compound microscope . He gave one of these instruments to Cardinal <unk> in May of that year for presentation to the Duke of Bavaria , and in September he sent another to Prince Cesi . The <unk> played a role again in naming the " microscope " a year later when fellow academy member Giovanni Faber coined the word for Galileo 's invention from the Greek words <unk> ( micron ) meaning " small " , and <unk> ( <unk> ) meaning " to look at " . The word was meant to be analogous with " telescope " . Illustrations of insects made using one of Galileo 's microscopes , and published in 1625 , appear to have been the first clear documentation of the use of a compound microscope . 
 In 1612 , having determined the orbital periods of Jupiter 's satellites , Galileo proposed that with sufficiently accurate knowledge of their orbits , one could use their positions as a universal clock , and this would make possible the determination of longitude . He worked on this problem from time to time during the remainder of his life ; but the practical problems were severe . The method was first successfully applied by Giovanni Domenico Cassini in 1681 and was later used extensively for large land surveys ; this method , for example , was used to survey France , and later by Zebulon Pike of the midwestern United States in 1806 . For sea navigation , where delicate telescopic observations were more difficult , the longitude problem eventually required development of a practical portable marine chronometer , such as that of John Harrison . Late in his life , when totally blind , Galileo designed an escapement mechanism for a pendulum clock ( called Galileo 's escapement ) , although no clock using this was built until after the first fully operational pendulum clock was made by Christiaan Huygens in the 1650s . 
 = = Physics = = 
 Galileo 's theoretical and experimental work on the motions of bodies , along with the largely independent work of Kepler and René Descartes , was a precursor of the classical mechanics developed by Sir Isaac Newton . Galileo conducted several experiments with pendulums . It is popularly believed ( thanks to the biography by Vincenzo Viviani ) that these began by watching the swings of the bronze chandelier in the cathedral of Pisa , using his pulse as a timer . Later experiments are described in his Two New Sciences . Galileo claimed that a simple pendulum is <unk> , i.e. that its swings always take the same amount of time , independently of the amplitude . In fact , this is only approximately true , as was discovered by Christiaan Huygens . Galileo also found that the square of the period varies directly with the length of the pendulum . Galileo 's son , Vincenzo , sketched a clock based on his father 's theories in 1642 . The clock was never built and , because of the large swings required by its verge escapement , would have been a poor timekeeper . ( See Engineering above . ) 
 Galileo is lesser known for , yet still credited with , being one of the first to understand sound frequency . By scraping a chisel at different speeds , he linked the pitch of the sound produced to the spacing of the chisel 's skips , a measure of frequency . In 1638 , Galileo described an experimental method to measure the speed of light by arranging that two observers , each having lanterns equipped with shutters , observe each other 's lanterns at some distance . The first observer opens the shutter of his lamp , and , the second , upon seeing the light , immediately opens the shutter of his own lantern . The time between the first observer 's opening his shutter and seeing the light from the second observer 's lamp indicates the time it takes light to travel back and forth between the two observers . Galileo reported that when he tried this at a distance of less than a mile , he was unable to determine whether or not the light appeared instantaneously . Sometime between Galileo 's death and 1667 , the members of the Florentine Accademia del Cimento repeated the experiment over a distance of about a mile and obtained a similarly inconclusive result . We now know that the speed of light is far too fast to be measured by such methods ( with human shutter @-@ openers on Earth ) . 
 Galileo put forward the basic principle of relativity , that the laws of physics are the same in any system that is moving at a constant speed in a straight line , regardless of its particular speed or direction . Hence , there is no absolute motion or absolute rest . This principle provided the basic framework for Newton 's laws of motion and is central to Einstein 's special theory of relativity . 
 = = = Falling bodies = = = 
 A biography by Galileo 's pupil Vincenzo Viviani stated that Galileo had dropped balls of the same material , but different masses , from the Leaning Tower of Pisa to demonstrate that their time of descent was independent of their mass . This was contrary to what Aristotle had taught : that heavy objects fall faster than lighter ones , in direct proportion to weight . While this story has been retold in popular accounts , there is no account by Galileo himself of such an experiment , and it is generally accepted by historians that it was at most a thought experiment which did not actually take place . An exception is Drake , who argues that the experiment did take place , more or less as Viviani described it . The experiment described was actually performed by Simon Stevin ( commonly known as <unk> ) and Jan <unk> de Groot , although the building used was actually the church tower in Delft in 1586 . However most of his experiments with falling bodies were carried out using inclined planes where both the issues of timing and wind resistance were much reduced . 
 In his 1638 Discorsi , Galileo 's character Salviati , widely regarded as Galileo 's spokesman , held that all unequal weights would fall with the same finite speed in a vacuum . But this had previously been proposed by Lucretius and Simon Stevin . Cristiano <unk> 's Salviati also held it could be experimentally demonstrated by the comparison of pendulum motions in air with bobs of lead and of cork which had different weight but which were otherwise similar . 
 Galileo proposed that a falling body would fall with a uniform acceleration , as long as the resistance of the medium through which it was falling remained negligible , or in the limiting case of its falling through a vacuum . He also derived the correct <unk> law for the distance travelled during a uniform acceleration starting from rest — namely , that it is proportional to the square of the elapsed time ( d ∝ t 2 ) . Prior to Galileo , Nicole Oresme , in the 14th century , had derived the times @-@ squared law for uniformly accelerated change , and Domingo de Soto had suggested in the 16th century that bodies falling through a homogeneous medium would be uniformly accelerated . Galileo expressed the time @-@ squared law using geometrical constructions and mathematically precise words , adhering to the standards of the day . ( It remained for others to re @-@ express the law in algebraic terms ) . 
 He also concluded that objects retain their velocity in the absence of any impediments to their motion , thereby contradicting the generally accepted Aristotelian hypothesis that a body could only remain in so @-@ called " violent " , " unnatural " , or " forced " motion so long as an agent of change ( the " mover " ) continued to act on it . Philosophical ideas relating to inertia had been proposed by John Philoponus and Jean Buridan . Galileo stated : " Imagine any particle projected along a horizontal plane without friction ; then we know , from what has been more fully explained in the preceding pages , that this particle will move along this same plane with a motion which is uniform and perpetual , provided the plane has no limits " This was incorporated into Newton 's laws of motion ( first law ) . 
 = = Mathematics = = 
 While Galileo 's application of mathematics to experimental physics was innovative , his mathematical methods were the standard ones of the day , including dozens of examples of an inverse proportion square root method passed down from Fibonacci and Archimedes . The analysis and proofs relied heavily on the <unk> theory of proportion , as set forth in the fifth book of Euclid 's Elements . This theory had become available only a century before , thanks to accurate translations by Tartaglia and others ; but by the end of Galileo 's life , it was being superseded by the algebraic methods of Descartes . 
 The concept now named Galileo 's paradox was not original with him . His proposed solution , that infinite numbers cannot be compared , is no longer considered useful . 
 = = His writings = = 
 Galileo 's early works describing scientific instruments include the 1586 tract entitled The Little Balance ( La <unk> ) describing an accurate balance to weigh objects in air or water and the 1606 printed manual Le <unk> del <unk> <unk> et Militare on the operation of a geometrical and military compass . 
 His early works in dynamics , the science of motion and mechanics were his 1590 Pisan De Motu ( On Motion ) and his circa 1600 Paduan Le <unk> ( Mechanics ) . The former was based on Aristotelian – Archimedean fluid dynamics and held that the speed of gravitational fall in a fluid medium was proportional to the excess of a body 's specific weight over that of the medium , whereby in a vacuum , bodies would fall with speeds in proportion to their specific weights . It also subscribed to the <unk> impetus dynamics in which impetus is self @-@ dissipating and free @-@ fall in a vacuum would have an essential terminal speed according to specific weight after an initial period of acceleration . 
 Galileo 's 1610 The Starry Messenger ( Sidereus Nuncius ) was the first scientific treatise to be published based on observations made through a telescope . It reported his discoveries of : 
 the Galilean moons 
 the roughness of the Moon 's surface 
 the existence of a large number of stars invisible to the naked eye , particularly those responsible for the appearance of the Milky Way 
 differences between the appearances of the planets and those of the fixed stars — the former appearing as small discs , while the latter appeared as <unk> points of light 
 Galileo published a description of sunspots in 1613 entitled Letters on Sunspots suggesting the Sun and heavens are corruptible . The Letters on Sunspots also reported his 1610 telescopic observations of the full set of phases of Venus , and his discovery of the puzzling " appendages " of Saturn and their even more puzzling subsequent disappearance . In 1615 Galileo prepared a manuscript known as the Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina which was not published in printed form until 1636 . This letter was a revised version of the Letter to Castelli , which was denounced by the Inquisition as an incursion upon theology by advocating Copernicanism both as physically true and as consistent with Scripture . In 1616 , after the order by the inquisition for Galileo not to hold or defend the Copernican position , Galileo wrote the Discourse on the Tides ( Discorso sul <unk> e il <unk> del mare ) based on the Copernican earth , in the form of a private letter to Cardinal Orsini . In 1619 , Mario Guiducci , a pupil of Galileo 's , published a lecture written largely by Galileo under the title Discourse on the Comets ( Discorso Delle <unk> ) , arguing against the Jesuit interpretation of comets . 
 In 1623 , Galileo published The Assayer — Il Saggiatore , which attacked theories based on Aristotle 's authority and promoted experimentation and the mathematical formulation of scientific ideas . The book was highly successful and even found support among the higher echelons of the Christian church . Following the success of The Assayer , Galileo published the Dialogue Concerning the Two Chief World Systems ( Dialogo sopra i due <unk> <unk> del mondo ) in 1632 . Despite taking care to adhere to the Inquisition 's 1616 instructions , the claims in the book favouring Copernican theory and a non <unk> model of the solar system led to Galileo being tried and banned on publication . Despite the publication ban , Galileo published his Discourses and Mathematical Demonstrations Relating to Two New Sciences ( Discorsi e <unk> <unk> , intorno a due nuove <unk> ) in 1638 in Holland , outside the jurisdiction of the Inquisition .

 The Galileo affair was largely forgotten after Galileo 's death , and the controversy subsided . The Inquisition 's ban on reprinting Galileo 's works was lifted in 1718 when permission was granted to publish an edition of his works ( excluding the condemned Dialogue ) in Florence . In 1741 Pope Benedict XIV authorised the publication of an edition of Galileo 's complete scientific works which included a mildly censored version of the Dialogue . In 1758 the general prohibition against works advocating heliocentrism was removed from the Index of prohibited books , although the specific ban on uncensored versions of the Dialogue and Copernicus 's De Revolutionibus remained . All traces of official opposition to heliocentrism by the church disappeared in 1835 when these works were finally dropped from the Index . 
 Interest in the Galileo affair was revived in the early 19th century , when Protestant polemicists used it ( and other events such as the Spanish Inquisition and the Flat Earth Myth ) to attack Roman Catholicism . Interest in it has waxed and waned ever since . In 1939 Pope Pius XII , in his first speech to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences , within a few months of his election to the papacy , described Galileo as being among the " most audacious heroes of research ... not afraid of the stumbling blocks and the risks on the way , nor fearful of the funereal monuments " . His close advisor of 40 years , Professor Robert Leiber , wrote : " Pius XII was very careful not to close any doors ( to science ) prematurely . He was energetic on this point and regretted that in the case of Galileo . " 
 On 15 February 1990 , in a speech delivered at the Sapienza University of Rome , Cardinal Ratzinger ( later to become Pope Benedict XVI ) cited some current views on the Galileo affair as forming what he called " a symptomatic case that permits us to see how deep the self @-@ doubt of the modern age , of science and technology goes today " . Some of the views he cited were those of the philosopher Paul Feyerabend , whom he quoted as saying " The Church at the time of Galileo kept much more closely to reason than did Galileo himself , and she took into consideration the ethical and social consequences of Galileo 's teaching too . Her verdict against Galileo was rational and just and the revision of this verdict can be justified only on the grounds of what is politically opportune . " The Cardinal did not clearly indicate whether he agreed or disagreed with Feyerabend 's assertions . He did , however , say " It would be foolish to construct an impulsive apologetic on the basis of such views . " 
 On 31 October 1992 , Pope John Paul II expressed regret for how the Galileo affair was handled , and issued a declaration acknowledging the errors committed by the Catholic Church tribunal that judged the scientific positions of Galileo Galilei , as the result of a study conducted by the Pontifical Council for Culture . In March 2008 the head of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences , Nicola Cabibbo , announced a plan to honour Galileo by erecting a statue of him inside the Vatican walls . In December of the same year , during events to mark the 400th anniversary of Galileo 's earliest telescopic observations , Pope Benedict XVI praised his contributions to astronomy . A month later , however , the head of the Pontifical Council for Culture , Gianfranco <unk> , revealed that the plan to erect a statue of Galileo in the grounds of the Vatican had been suspended . 
 = = = Impact on modern science = = = 
 According to Stephen Hawking , Galileo probably bears more of the responsibility for the birth of modern science than anybody else , and Albert Einstein called him the father of modern science . 
 Galileo 's astronomical discoveries and investigations into the Copernican theory have led to a lasting legacy which includes the categorisation of the four large moons of Jupiter discovered by Galileo ( Io , Europa , Ganymede and Callisto ) as the Galilean moons . Other scientific endeavours and principles are named after Galileo including the Galileo spacecraft , the first spacecraft to enter orbit around Jupiter , the proposed Galileo global satellite navigation system , the transformation between inertial systems in classical mechanics denoted Galilean transformation and the Gal ( unit ) , sometimes known as the Galileo , which is a non @-@ SI unit of acceleration . 
 Partly because 2009 was the fourth centenary of Galileo 's first recorded astronomical observations with the telescope , the United Nations scheduled it to be the International Year of Astronomy . A global scheme was laid out by the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) , also endorsed by UNESCO — the UN body responsible for educational , scientific and cultural matters . The International Year of Astronomy 2009 was intended to be a global celebration of astronomy and its contributions to society and culture , stimulating worldwide interest not only in astronomy but science in general , with a particular slant towards young people . 
 Asteroid 697 <unk> is named in his honour . 
 = = = In artistic and popular media = = = 
 Galileo is mentioned several times in the " opera " section of the Queen song , " Bohemian Rhapsody " . He features prominently in the song " Galileo " performed by the Indigo Girls and Amy Grant 's Galileo on her Heart in Motion album . 
 Twentieth @-@ century plays have been written on Galileo 's life , including Life of Galileo ( 1943 ) by the German playwright Bertolt Brecht , with a film adaptation ( 1975 ) of it , and Lamp At Midnight ( 1947 ) by Barrie <unk> , as well as the 2008 play " Galileo Galilei " . 
 Kim Stanley Robinson wrote a science fiction novel entitled Galileo 's Dream ( 2009 ) , in which Galileo is brought into the future to help resolve a crisis of scientific philosophy ; the story moves back and forth between Galileo 's own time and a hypothetical distant future , and contains a great deal of biographical information . 
 Galileo Galilei was recently selected as a main motif for a high value collectors ' coin : the € 25 International Year of Astronomy commemorative coin , minted in 2009 . This coin also commemorates the 400th anniversary of the invention of Galileo 's telescope . The obverse shows a portion of his portrait and his telescope . The background shows one of his first drawings of the surface of the moon . In the silver ring other telescopes are depicted : the Isaac Newton Telescope , the observatory in <unk> Abbey , a modern telescope , a radio telescope and a space telescope . In 2009 , the <unk> was also released . This is a mass @-@ produced , low @-@ cost educational 2 @-@ inch ( 51 mm ) telescope with relatively high quality .

 = The Daedalus Variations = 
 " The Daedalus Variations " is the 84th episode of the science fiction television series Stargate Atlantis , and is the fourth episode in the series ' fifth season . The episode first aired on August 1 , 2008 on the Sci Fi Channel in the United States , and subsequently aired on October 9 on Sky One in the United Kingdom . The episode was written by Alan McCullough , and directed by regular Stargate director , Andy Mikita . Richard Woolsey ( Robert Picardo ) and Jennifer Keller ( Jewel Staite ) do not appear in the episode , despite being credited during the opening title sequence . The episode bears similarities to the Flying Dutchman , a mythical ghost ship that drifts forever in the ocean with no chance of returning home . It received generally favourable reviews . 
 Episode writer McCullough described the episode as a one @-@ off " wild romp " , with much use of visual effects . The episode follows John Sheppard and his team , who investigates the mysterious appearance of the Daedalus over Atlantis , where they soon find the ship is from a parallel universe and makes its way through various alternate realities with an " alternate reality drive " . Stuck on the Daedalus , the team seeks to find a way to return , while they run into contact with a newly introduced alien race and find the ship 's new drive is slowly burning out , and they could be stranded in another universe forever . 
 = = Plot = = 
 A spaceship appears out of nowhere over Atlantis . John Sheppard ( Joe Flanigan ) and his team discover that the ship is the Daedalus , which is strange as Stargate Command confirms that the Daedalus is actually two days away from Earth . Sheppard 's team boards the new Daedalus and find it apparently abandoned with signs of battle damage . Teyla ( Rachel Luttrell ) views a log entry from the Daedalus commander , Colonel Sobel , who the team has never heard of before . Suddenly , there is a power spike and the Daedalus disappears from above Atlantis , while from the perspective of Sheppard 's team , Atlantis disappears . McKay finds that they have been propelled into a parallel universe by what he terms an " alternate reality drive " , and thus the Daedalus is actually from an alternate reality . 
 The team finds another version of themselves , dead , who come from yet another parallel universe and were trapped aboard while investigating the ship , just as they are . Soon , the ship jumps again , into a reality where Atlantis is under attack from an unfamiliar alien ship . Sheppard intervenes , and the aliens retaliate by launching fighters . One of the fighters crashes into the Daedalus before it jumps again , this time into a universe where Atlantis ' sun has already swelled into a red giant . To keep the ship from being burned up , McKay ( David Hewlett ) increases the rate at which the alternate reality drive activates , warning that his modifications are irreversible . Meanwhile , the team must contend with aliens from the crashed fighter . McKay figures out that there is no way to guide the alternate reality drive , but that they can return to their original reality by reversing the drive and jumping back through the realities they had visited before . They use the maneuvering thrusters to stabilize the ship 's orbit above the red giant , and weather another attack by the aliens , with help from an alternate Atlantis . Once they return to their own reality , they leave the ship in space suits after a remaining alien detonates an explosive , causing a breach in the ship 's hull and are picked up by Lorne ( Kavan Smith ) after the Daedalus disappears . In the end , McKay is shown working on fixing the alternate reality drive , despite Sheppard 's admonishments .

 The original concept of an episode involving alternate realities was a room in Atlantis that shifts into alternate realities . However , the idea had several issues , including the possibility of no Atlantis in one reality , so Robert C. Cooper suggested using the Daedalus . The final draft of " The Daedalus Variations " was completed on February 11 . On February 12 , the prosthetics meeting for the episode , as well as " The Seed " , " Broken Ties " and " Whispers " took place , which most likely involved the unknown aliens featured from the episode . The appearance of the aliens was revealed in the advertisement for the episode on July 27 . In an interview with episode writer , Alan McCullough , he described the episode as a " great team show " , and a " visual effects spectacular . " On March 10 , Captain Sobol was cast . Sobol was the alternate commander of the Daedalus , rather than Colonel Caldwell ( Mitch Pileggi ) . By the time the episode aired , Sobol was female ( portrayed by Tracy Waterhouse ) , she held the rank of Colonel instead , and her name was spelled " Sobel " . 
 Much of the episode was filmed on the Daedalus set . Due to that , visual effects were required to fill in the external shots . The episode was reportedly one of the most expensive VFX budgets in the series , and is the most expensive for the season . The star map behind the captain 's chair of the Daedalus is usually lit green . However , the episode 's writer and supervising producer , Alan McCullough , deliberately turned the map 90 degrees and changed the color from green to orange , so as to make the ship different from the normal Daedalus . McCullough also stated that the episode is a one @-@ off , but did not rule out a return beyond the fifth season . He also said that he originally planned the team to visit a reality where the Ancients won the war against the Wraith , but this idea was dropped as it would detract from the main storyline . The episode was Jason Momoa 's first appearance with his customised wig . After he had his hair cut by the time the fourth season was completed , for the first three episodes he had it sewn back on . However , when SCI FI wouldn 't allow his hairstyle to be changed , they switched to the wig after Momoa complained about the pain of having his hair sewn on again .

They were beaten by ECW on Sci Fi ( with 1 @.@ 4 ) , Ghost Hunters International ( with 1 @.@ 6 ) and the season three premiere of Eureka ( which earned the highest rating of 2 @.@ 1 ) . The episode was also received generally positive . Tory Ireland Mell of IGN praised the episode for its reasonably short teaser , thinking the shorter it is , the better the episode , as well as its gripping storyline and the introduction of the alien race , particularly the fact that very little is known about them , stating it was " a perfect tease by the writers . " The episode was rated 9 @.@ 1 out of 10 overall . Marx Pyle of the SyFy Portal ( which was since renamed Airlock Alpha ) compared the episode as Atlantis ' version of Star Trek : The Next Generation episode " Q Who ? " in respect to the introduction of a new " big bad " for the future . It was praised for being a " fun filler " episode , and Pyle enjoyed the scene where the two Sheppards converse , and the space battle , believing only Battlestar Galactica could beat them . However , Pyle criticised the episode for the absence of Woolsey , and McKay 's apparent quick understanding of new technologies including the alternate reality drive , as well as feeling that Sci Fi gave away too much information from the previews of the episode . 
 = Warhawk ( 2007 video game ) = 
 Warhawk is a multiplayer third @-@ person vehicle and flight combat video game developed by Incognito Entertainment exclusively for the PlayStation 3 . It is a remake of an aerial warfare game of the same name , which was a launch title on the original PlayStation . Apart from the similarity of controlling aircraft , the remake bears little other resemblance . It was the first PlayStation 3 game to be available both for download on the PlayStation Network and for retail on Blu @-@ ray Disc . For the United States , Blu @-@ ray Disc and PlayStation Network versions were released on August 28 , 2007 . The PlayStation Network version was released in Europe , Australia and Japan on August 30 , August 31 and October 4 respectively . The Blu @-@ ray Disc version was released in Australia and Europe on September 20 and September 21 , respectively , but was not released in Japan . 
 Warhawk was initially intended to have both single @-@ player and multiplayer modes , however the single @-@ player element was canceled during development due to concerns that it was inferior to the game 's multiplayer component . The game was released with five maps ( each with five possible configurations ) and four game types , Deathmatch , Team Deathmatch , Zones and Capture the Flag . After the 1 @.@ 4 update , the number of game types increased to six with the addition of the Hero and Collection modes . Three optional expansion packs for the game containing new maps and equipment increase the number of available maps to eight . 
 Warhawk was met with a generally positive reception by reviewers . However , for a few months after its initial launch it was plagued by connection and server issues , including ranking issues with players , which were subsequently corrected in updates . The player is able to rank @-@ up though 20 ranks ranging from Recruit to General , unlocking new personnel and aircraft customization options at each rank . A spiritual successor , Starhawk , was released in May 2012 . 
 = = Gameplay = = 
 Warhawk is a third @-@ person shooter set in a science fictional , perpetual war between the <unk> Republic and <unk> Empire ( blue and red team , respectively ) . 
 There are two ground vehicles , a jeep and a tank , and an armored personnel carrier is added by the Operation : Broken Mirror expansion . There are two air vehicles , the Warhawk and Nemesis ( which are only cosmetically different ) , both of which can use nine weapons , an example is the AS @-@ 3 Tow Missile system . That weapon is the only weapon in the game where the player guides the weapon , the players screen is devoted to guiding the missile and leaving the player open to getting hit . But the upside is that it does massive damage and is the largest explosion in the game . The Omega Dawn expansion adds a dropship , and the Fallen Star expansion adds a jetpack . There are three turrets available to the player ( anti @-@ air missile turret , anti @-@ air flak turret , and the .50 caliber anti @-@ infantry machine gun ) . The game uses the PlayStation 3 Sixaxis and DualShock 3 controllers . The game can be set to make use of these controllers ' motion sensing function to allow the players to control aircraft and ground vehicles by tilting the controller in different directions rather than the more conventional methods of using the D @-@ pad or analog sticks . However , a traditional control scheme is the default option . Warhawk offers online and offline multiplayer play . Offline allows for 1 @-@ 4 players splitscreen ( without bots ) . Online features up to 32 @-@ player battles , with the ability to have up to 4 players use one PlayStation 3 in split screen mode ( on non @-@ ranked servers that permit it ) . Players 2 @-@ 4 can enter or exit the game while a match is in progress . 
 The game uses medals and rewards , which are awarded for certain tasks . As of <unk> , the game supports trophies , which will be used in the online service PlayStation Home . Players are also able to customize their characters with armor squad markings , Warhawk paint schemes , and other accessories . More customization options are unlocked as the player increases in rank . Warhawk also allows the creation of clans , which may participate in online events and competitions . The game also makes use of arbiters , paid anonymous players who are tasked to find cheaters within the game . They are able to punish offending players in several ways , such as an email warning , a forum post , a kick , or a temporary / permanent ban . <unk> can also request that the player 's stats be erased . 
 = = = PlayStation Home = = = 
 Warhawk is one of many games that supports game launching in PlayStation Home . This feature allows players to host a game in Home and then launch it once other players have joined . The player may even invite friends to the game launch . Once the game has been launched from Home the players may return to Home at any time via the " Return to PlayStation Home " option that appears instead of the " Quit Game " option . On February 26 , 2009 , Incognito Entertainment and SCE Studios Santa Monica launched the Warhawk space for PlayStation Home . Beyond its unique aesthetics , the space is functionally similar to those for Uncharted : Drake 's Fortune and Far Cry 2 , with one notable exception : the " Warhawk Sand Table " . It 's a place to plan in @-@ game strategies using " VR " set @-@ pieces — vehicles , maneuver icons , etc . - which can be moved around on 2D versions of any of the game 's maps ( and their variants ) . 
 The first person to access the table is in control . Here 's where one of the problems arises : anyone can walk up and watch as a user plans their " secret " strategy . Furthermore , there 's no way to share or use the finished battle plan within the game . It 's all up to each player 's memory ( or notepad ) . 
 There is also a " Learning Terminal " ( eight in all ) that tells the users about General Hints , Weapons , and Flying . 
 <unk> developed the Warhawk game space for Incognito Entertainment and SCE Studios Santa Monica as well as the " Warhawk Sand Table " in the space . 
 On February 11 , 2010 , a Warhawk personal space was released in Home . It includes the Sand Table featured in the Game Space as well as a <unk> turret mini @-@ game . 
 As of July 2010 , the Warhawk game space has been removed from PlayStation Home , due to lack of players actually using the space . 
 = = = Game modes = = = 
 Warhawk supports 6 separate game modes compatible with all variations of all of the maps . 
 Deathmatch . Every man for himself . The game ends when a player reaches the score limit , or when time expires . 
 Team Deathmatch . Same rules as a deathmatch except the player is automatically assigned to either the <unk> ( red ) or <unk> ( blue ) teams . Game ends when the combined score limit is met or when time expires . 
 Dogfight . A variation on Deathmatch / Team Deathmatch where you play only in the Warhawk / <unk> planes . 
 Hero . A version of the team deathmatch where a hero is randomly selected on both sides for one minute , or until the hero dies . The hero gets a health boost , damage boost , and every weapon in the game ( which the hero can keep if he survives the one minute ) . The key difference between Hero and TDM is that in TDM all enemy kills are counted to the team total whereas in Hero , only when killing the Hero or when the Hero kills an enemy are they counted towards the total . 
 Capture the Flag . This mode of game play is by far the most popular among Warhawk players . In this mode each team has a flag at their base which they must defend while attempting to capture the second flag in their opponent 's base . You can only capture the flag if your flag remains at the base . 
 Collection . This mode features 4 " cores " scattered along the map . The object is to collect as many cores as possible . Once a core has been collected , a new one will respawn in the same spot as where the player got it . If a player dies , all cores are lost , and an enemy , or nearby team mate can collect them . 
 Zones . The object of this mode is to capture various control points on the map . Each control point has 3 levels for each team , and a neutral level . A player can do this in other game modes ( except deathmatch ) to earn points for yourself , but in Zones , their team gains points for the number of zones the player has , and how many levels each one has . The player will only be able to capture levels if the area around it is clear , or captured by their team . The game ends when the time runs out , score limit is reached , or if the player is able to capture all control points .

 Warhawk was first announced to the public in May 2005 , with a working build shown at E3 in 2006 . This version was the first PlayStation 3 title to be shown with the newly announced Sixaxis motion sensing technology . In February 2007 , it was announced that the single player element of the game was to be pulled . This was due to concerns Incognito had over the quality of the single @-@ player campaign , particularly when compared to the multi @-@ player modes . Dylan Jobe , the game 's director , stated , " If we were to continue down our single @-@ player / multiplayer approach , it would have resulted in not as good single player or not as good multiplayer " . The extra development of the multiplayer mode was used to improve existing elements such as in @-@ game communication , and to implement new features such as On Demand Split Screen , whereby players can easily enter split screen mid @-@ game . Split screen can only be used in battles that allow it . Only unranked servers have the ability to have it and even then , it is an option whether or not the host wants it on or off . It was also revealed at the same time that Warhawk would be made available for download over the PlayStation Network . 
 In August 2007 , Sony Computer Entertainment America released news that PlayStation 3 consoles would be used as the dedicated servers for Warhawk . A photograph was released which showed a server room with several PlayStation 3 consoles in racks . Each server is able to support 32 players . The games developers have commented that the engine used in the game features technology which could not be easily implemented on any other platform , such as procedurally generated water and waves , as well as volumetric clouds . 
 Following the games release , many issues with networking and player statistics were reported , such as delays in receiving points and awards , failure to receive the points or awards , and " connection failed " and " connection lost " errors . To address these issues , Incognito released several server @-@ side patches before releasing the games first update , Version 1 @.@ 1 . This update addressed the majority of issues users experienced with the game , with others being addressed in the Version 1 @.@ 2 update . A demo was released on the PlayStation Store on October 9 , 2008 . 
 = = = Release = = = 
 There was initial confusion as to how this game would be distributed to consumers , after the announcement that it would be a multiplayer @-@ only title . Sony announced on May 16 , 2007 , that there would be two iterations of the game . The game alone is downloadable from the PlayStation Store for US $ 29 @.@ 99 ( £ 19 @.@ 99 , € 29 @.@ 99 ) , with an initial download size of <unk> . This version is restricted to the PlayStation Network account that buys it . The second is a retail Blu @-@ ray Disc version that sells for $ 59 @.@ 99 ( the standard retail price of most PlayStation 3 games upon release ) , bundled with a <unk> <unk> Bluetooth headset in America and the <unk> <unk> in Europe , allowing players to chat with other players online while playing the game . An additional third was later released on October 10 , 2007 without the inclusion of a USB headset , which was priced at US $ 39 @.@ 99 . Both retail versions feature extra content such as behind @-@ the @-@ scenes developer interviews , concept art and trailers . Warhawk was re @-@ released as a Greatest Hits title on July 28 , 2008 for $ 29 @.@ 99 . 
 = = = Updates and expansions = = = 
 Additional downloadable content ( DLC ) has been released , with more announced , since the game 's launch . Expansions include new maps , weapon upgrades and character customization options . The DualShock 3 controller became compatible with the game upon the release of the version 1 @.@ 20 patch . Incognito has stated that any future development on the incomplete single player campaign would only be released as a separate product , and not as an expansion to the current game . Warhawk updates are free , but expansion packs are sold online for a price . Updates are mandatory installations that must be completed in order to play the game . Expansion packs are optional , and the ability to purchase expansion packs is available within the menu of the game itself , as well as through the PlayStation Store . 
 The 1 @.@ 1 and 1 @.@ 2 updates were released on October 19 , 2007 and December 19 , 2007 respectively , fixing numerous exploits and stability issues . Update 1 @.@ 3 was released on April 2 , 2008 and included two new weapons , eighteen new player @-@ made customizations for planes and forty @-@ four new player @-@ made custom insignias for both troops and planes , integration of PlayStation Home , and new in @-@ game chat features , such as cross @-@ team chat . Also in update 1 @.@ 3 , the " stat padding " issue , a bug that allowed game players to cheat by increasing their points cumulatively by dropping the opponents ' flag off the level and having it respawn back into the players ' hands to repeat , was resolved by completely removing the ability to drop the flag . Update 1 @.@ 4 , released on July 16 , 2008 , features two new game modes called " Hero " and " Collection , " and introduced the Quick Join feature , which searches for a server that connects the user to matches that work with the user 's current level . The next update , Version 1 @.@ 5 , was released on August 27 , 2008 and includes trophy support , the winning entries from the European version of the paint and insignia contest , and allows the user to play music via the XrossMediaBar in @-@ game . 
 Three expansion packs have been released . The first , " Operation : Omega Dawn , " released on December 20 , 2007 , includes a new night @-@ themed map , Omega Factory , and a new aircraft , the KT @-@ 424 Combat <unk> . The second expansion pack was released on April 17 , 2008 entitled " Operation : Broken Mirror " , which includes a new armoured personnel carrier equipped with an energy shield and the ability to boost , similar to a Warhawk , as well as serving as a mobile spawn point . A new map called <unk> Glacier was also included in the new expansion . It is the largest map to date , and includes 10 different layouts . In the PlayStation Store , there is also an option to purchase the first two Booster @-@ packs for a reduced price , and there will be another combo pack with all three included . The latest booster pack , " Operation Fallen Star , " was released on August 28 , 2008 and added the Icarus MK1 Jetpack which allows troops to fire while airborne as well as a new map called Tau Crater . All three of the booster packs cannot be combined , nor can one affiliate with another , and people who do not own an expansion featured in a server they are attempting to join will not be able to join the server . 
 On August 27 , 2008 the 1 @.@ 5 patch was released and included the addition of trophy support . A total of 57 trophies are available in the game , 10 of which are retroactive and can be obtained based on previously recorded statistics without the user having to complete tasks a second time . A further 34 are based upon gameplay and so are not retroactive . The trophies can be attained Split @-@ screen or <unk> as well . Each of the available expansions also feature an additional 4 trophies . 
 On May 13 , 2011 , game developer Dylan Jobe unveiled the successor to the game entitled Starhawk on <unk> . Starhawk was released on May 8 , 2012 .

 Warhawk generally received positive reviews , with its aggregate review scores being classed as generally favorable by Metacritic and GameRankings . PSM provided the lowest review score officially qualified by the GameRankings website . The magazine described it as " a third @-@ person shooter that never quite gets off the ground . " Other reviews were more positive in their outlook . PSM3 described the game as " a masterpiece of balance , of design , and the jewel in Sony 's online crown . " UK magazine Edge described it as an " instantly gratifying experience " , also saying that the lack of a single @-@ player campaign was made up for by " its brilliantly implemented notion of flight and considered balance " . Nick Costanza and Vin Acosta were largely critical of the game , saying " it can 't be taken seriously " . 
 1UP.com gave Warhawk a positive review , but said , " It 's just not quite $ 40 worth , " referring to the price of the downloadable version on the U.S. PlayStation Store . It was given the IGN Editors ' Choice Award , calling it " a AAA experience that is an adrenaline rush for online fans . " Game Informer described Warhawk as " better than they 'd hoped for " . GamePro stated that although Warhawk offers an intense online combat experience , being dropped immediately into the action leaves you " somewhat bewildered " and doesn 't give you that " feeling of connection " to the game . GameTrailers described Warhawk as " simply fun , easy to compete , but challenging to shine . " Adam Sessler from X @-@ Play complimented the game 's multiplayer only style saying " ...

 = New Jersey Route 28 = 
 Route 28 is a state highway in the central part of New Jersey , United States that is 26 @.@ 44 mi ( 42 @.@ 55 km ) long . Its western terminus is at U.S. Route 22 in Bridgewater Township , Somerset County while its eastern terminus is at Route 27 in Elizabeth , Union County . From its western terminus , Route 28 heads east through Raritan , intersecting County Route 567 and then U.S. Route 202 and U.S. Route 206 at the Somerville Circle before heading through the central part of Somerville . Past Somerville , the route interchanges with Interstate 287 in Bridgewater Township before intersecting many 500 @-@ series county roads including County Route 525 and County Route 527 in Bound Brook , County Route 529 in Dunellen , Middlesex County , County Route 531 in Plainfield , Union County , and County Route 509 in Westfield . Route 28 continues east , intersecting Route 59 and the Garden State Parkway in Cranford before heading to Elizabeth , where it crosses Route 439 before ending at Route 27 . Route 28 is a two- to four @-@ lane road its entire length that passes through suburban areas and runs within a close distance of New Jersey Transit ’ s Raritan Valley Line for much of its length . 
 Prior to 1927 , Route 28 was known as Route 9 , which was designated in 1917 to run from Phillipsburg east to Elizabeth . With the creation of the U.S. Highway System in 1926 , U.S. Route 22 was designated along with Route 28 . In 1927 , most of pre @-@ 1927 Route 9 became Route 28 , with the exception of the route through Elizabeth , which became Route 27 @-@ 28 Link as Route 28 followed present @-@ day Route 439 to the Goethals Bridge . Also legislated at this time was a spur of Route 28 called Route S28 , which became Route 18 in 1953 . By 1941 , U.S. Route 22 was moved off the Route 28 alignment in Phillipsburg , with U.S. Route 22 Alternate ( now Route 122 ) taking its place , as well as east of Bridgewater Township , where it was realigned to follow Route 28 @-@ 29 Link and Route 29 to Newark . In 1953 , the western terminus of Route 28 was moved to its current location to avoid the concurrencies with U.S. Route 22 and U.S. Route 22 Alternate while the portion of the route in Elizabeth was realigned to replace Route 27 @-@ 28 Link , with the former route becoming Route 439 .

 In 1917 , Route 9 was designated by the state of New Jersey to run from Phillipsburg east to Elizabeth , passing through Clinton , Somerville , Plainfield , and Westfield . With the establishment of the U.S. Highway System in 1926 , U.S. Route 22 was concurrently designated along the entire length of Route 9 . A year later , in the 1927 New Jersey state highway renumbering , Route 28 was legislated to run from Phillipsburg east to the Goethals Bridge , replacing pre @-@ 1927 Route 9 between Phillipsburg and present @-@ day Route 439 in Elizabeth , and following current Route 439 toward the Goethals Bridge . Meanwhile , the former alignment of pre @-@ 1927 Route 9 east became Route 27 @-@ 28 Link , as it provided a connection between Route 27 and Route 28 . A spur of Route 28 , named Route S28 , was also legislated in the 1927 renumbering and was to run from Route 28 in Middlesex southeast to Route 4 ( now Route 79 ) in Matawan . What was built of this route became Route 18 in the 1953 New Jersey state highway renumbering . By 1941 , U.S. Route 22 was eventually moved from Route 28 to follow Route 28 @-@ 29 Link and Route 29 between the Somerville area and Newark . Also , U.S. Route 22 was realigned to its current alignment along Route 24 and Route 24 @-@ 28 Link in Phillipsburg , with the alignment along Route 28 becoming U.S. Route 22 Alternate ( now Route 122 ) . In the 1953 renumbering of state highways , which eliminated long concurrencies between U.S. and state highways , the western terminus of Route 28 was cut back to its current location with U.S. Route 22 in Bridgewater Township , with the designation west of there dropped in favor of U.S. Route 22 and U.S. Route 22 Alternate . In addition , Route 28 was moved to its current alignment in Elizabeth , replacing Route 27 @-@ 28 Link ; Route 439 was designated along the former alignment of Route 28 that ran to the Goethals Bridge .

The highway travels counterclockwise from U.S. Route 101 ( US 101 ) in Ilwaco south to Cape Disappointment and north to an intersection with itself in Ilwaco . SR 100 , part of the Lewis and Clark Trail Scenic Byway , serves as a loop route and has a spur route that serves the state park and a Coast Guard station . SR 100 was established in 1991 on the existing North Head Road , which was a paved county road by the late 1950s . The highway was washed away during a 1994 winter storm and had its spur route shortened in 2006 .

SR 100 turns north and travels into <unk> along Baker Bay and the Columbia River before it ends at an intersection with SR 100 a block from its terminus at US 101 . 
 Every year , the Washington State Department of Transportation ( WSDOT ) conducts a series of surveys on its highways in the state to measure traffic volume . This is expressed in terms of average annual daily traffic ( AADT ) , which is a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year . In 2011 , WSDOT calculated that the busiest section of SR 100 was its terminus at US 101 in <unk> , serving 2 @,@ 100 vehicles , while the least busiest section was the intersection with its spur route in Cape Disappointment State Park , serving 650 vehicles .

 The North Head Road portion of SR 100 , traveling west from Ilwaco to the Pacific coast and south to Cape Disappointment within Fort Canby State Park , has existed as a paved roadway since 1957 . SR 100 was established in 1991 by the Washington State Legislature and was made into a complete loop route around the cape , with a short spur route traveling south into Fort Canby State Park , later renamed to Cape Disappointment State Park . Robert Gray Way was rebuilt after a 1994 winter storm washed away the roadway into Baker Bay .

 = Sperm whale = 
 The sperm whale ( Physeter macrocephalus ) , or cachalot , is the largest of the toothed whales and the largest toothed predator . It is the only living member of genus Physeter , and one of three extant species in the sperm whale family , along with the pygmy sperm whale and dwarf sperm whale of the genus Kogia . 
 Mature males average 16 metres ( 52 ft ) in length but some may reach 20 @.@ 5 metres ( 67 ft ) , with the head representing up to one @-@ third of the animal 's length . <unk> to 2 @,@ 250 metres ( 7 @,@ 382 ft ) , it is the second deepest diving mammal , following only the Cuvier 's beaked whale . The sperm whale 's clicking vocalization , a form of echolocation and communication , may be as loud as 230 decibels ( re 1 µPa at 1 m ) underwater . It has the largest brain of any animal on Earth , more than five times heavier than a human 's . Sperm whales can live for more than 60 years . 
 The sperm whale can be found anywhere in the open ocean . Females and young males live together in groups while mature males live solitary lives outside of the mating season . The females cooperate to protect and nurse their young . Females give birth every four to twenty years , and care for the calves for more than a decade . A mature sperm whale has few natural predators , although calves and weakened adults are sometimes killed by pods of orcas . 
 From the early eighteenth century through the late 20th , the species was a prime target of whalers . The head of the whale contains a liquid wax called spermaceti , from which the whale derives its name . Spermaceti was used in lubricants , oil lamps , and candles . Ambergris , a waste product from its digestive system , is still used as a fixative in perfumes . Occasionally the sperm whale 's great size allowed it to defend itself effectively against whalers . The species is now protected by a whaling moratorium , and is currently listed as vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources ( IUCN ) . 
 = = Taxonomy and naming = = 
 = = = Etymology = = = 
 The name sperm whale is a clip of spermaceti whale . Spermaceti , originally mistakenly identified as the whales ' semen , is the semi @-@ liquid , waxy substance found within the whale 's head ( see below ) . The sperm whale is also known as the " cachalot " , which is thought to derive from the archaic French for " tooth " or " big teeth " , as preserved for example in <unk> in the Gascon dialect ( a word of either Romance or Basque origin ) . The etymological dictionary of <unk> says the origin is uncertain , but it suggests that it comes from the Vulgar Latin <unk> , plural of <unk> , " sword hilt " . The word cachalot came to English via French from Spanish or Portuguese <unk> , perhaps from Galician / Portuguese <unk> , " big head " . The term is retained in the Russian word for the animal , <unk> ( <unk> ) , as well as in many other languages . 
 The scientific genus name Physeter comes from Greek <unk> ( <unk> ) , meaning " blowpipe , blowhole ( of a whale ) " , or – as a pars pro toto – " whale " . The specific name macrocephalus is Latinized from the Greek <unk> ( <unk> , meaning " big @-@ headed " ) , from makros ( <unk> , " large " ) + <unk> ( <unk> , " head " ) . 
 Its synonymous specific name catodon means " down @-@ tooth " , from the Greek elements cat ( a ) - ( " below " ) and <unk> ( " tooth " ) ; so named because it has visible teeth only in its lower jaw . ( See : Teeth ) Another synonym <unk> ( " Australasian " ) was applied to sperm whales in the southern hemisphere . 
 = = = Taxonomy = = = 
 The sperm whale belongs to the order Cetartiodactyla , the order containing all cetaceans and even @-@ toed ungulates . It is a member of the unranked clade Cetacea , with all the whales , dolphins , and porpoises , and further classified into Odontoceti , containing all the toothed whales and dolphins . It is the sole extant species of its genus , Physeter , in the family Physeteridae . Two species of the related extant genus Kogia , the pygmy sperm whale Kogia breviceps and the dwarf sperm whale K. simus , are placed either in this family or in the family Kogiidae . In some taxonomic schemes the families Kogiidae and Physeteridae are combined as the superfamily Physeteroidea ( see the separate entry on the sperm whale family ) . 
 The sperm whale is one of the species originally described by Linnaeus in 1758 in his eighteenth century work , Systema Naturae . He recognised four species in the genus Physeter . Experts soon realised that just one such species exists , although there has been debate about whether this should be named P. catodon or P. macrocephalus , two of the names used by Linnaeus . Both names are still used , although most recent authors now accept macrocephalus as the valid name , limiting catodon 's status to a lesser synonym .

 The sperm whale is the largest toothed whale , with adult males measuring up to 20 @.@ 5 metres ( 67 ft ) long and weighing up to 57 @,@ 000 kilograms ( 56 long tons ; 63 short tons ) . By contrast , the second largest toothed whale , Baird 's <unk> Whale measures 12 @.@ 8 metres ( 42 ft ) and weighs up to 15 short tons ( 14 @,@ 000 kg ) . The Nantucket Whaling Museum has a 5 @.@ 5 metres ( 18 ft ) -long jawbone . The museum claims that this individual was 24 metres ( 80 ft ) long ; the whale that sank the Essex ( one of the incidents behind Moby @-@ Dick ) was claimed to be 26 metres ( 85 ft ) . A similar size is reported from a jawbone from the British Natural History Museum . A 67 @-@ foot specimen is reported from a Soviet whaling fleet near the Kurile Islands in 1950 . There is disagreement on the claims of adult males approaching or exceeding 24 metres ( 80 ft ) in length . 
 Extensive whaling may have decreased their size , as males were highly sought , primarily after World War II . Today , males do not usually exceed 18 @.@ 3 metres ( 60 ft ) in length or 51 @,@ 000 kilograms ( 50 long tons ; 56 short tons ) in weight . Another view holds that exploitation by <unk> had virtually no effect on the size of the bull sperm whales , and their size may have actually increased in current times on the basis of density dependent effects . Old males taken at Solander Islands were recorded to be extremely large and unusually rich in <unk> . 
 It is among the most sexually dimorphic of all cetaceans . At birth both sexes are about the same size , but mature males are typically 30 % to 50 % longer and three times as massive as females . 
 The sperm whale 's unique body is unlikely to be confused with any other species . The sperm whale 's distinctive shape comes from its very large , block @-@ shaped head , which can be one @-@ quarter to one @-@ third of the animal 's length . The S @-@ shaped blowhole is located very close to the front of the head and shifted to the whale 's left . This gives rise to a distinctive bushy , forward @-@ angled spray . 
 The sperm whale 's flukes ( tail lobes ) are triangular and very thick . Proportionally , they are larger than that of any other cetacean , and are very flexible . The whale lifts its flukes high out of the water as it begins a feeding dive . It has a series of ridges on the back 's caudal third instead of a dorsal fin . The largest ridge was called the ' hump ' by whalers , and can be mistaken for a dorsal fin because of its shape and size . 
 In contrast to the smooth skin of most large whales , its back skin is usually wrinkly and has been likened to a prune by whale @-@ watching enthusiasts . <unk> have been reported . 
 = = = Skeleton = = = 
 The ribs are bound to the spine by flexible cartilage , which allows the ribcage to collapse rather than snap under high pressure . While sperm whales are well adapted to diving , repeated dives to great depths have long @-@ term effects . Bones show the same pitting that signals decompression sickness in humans . Older skeletons showed the most extensive pitting , whereas calves showed no damage . This damage may indicate that sperm whales are susceptible to decompression sickness , and sudden surfacing could be lethal to them . 
 Like all cetaceans , the spine of the sperm whale has reduced <unk> joints , of which the remnants are modified and are positioned higher on the vertebral dorsal spinous process , hugging it laterally , to prevent extensive lateral bending and facilitate more dorso @-@ ventral bending . These evolutionary modifications make the spine more flexible but weaker than the spines of terrestrial vertebrates . 
 As with other toothed whales , the skull of the sperm whale is asymmetrical so as to aid echolocation . Sound waves that strike the whale from different directions will not be channeled in the same way . Within the basin of the cranium , the openings of the bony narial tubes ( from which the nasal passages spring ) are skewed towards the left side of the skull . 
 = = = Jaws and teeth = = = 
 The sperm whale 's lower jaw is very narrow and underslung . The sperm whale has 18 to 26 teeth on each side of its lower jaw which fit into sockets in the upper jaw . The teeth are cone @-@ shaped and weigh up to 1 kilogram ( 2 @.@ 2 lb ) each . The teeth are functional , but do not appear to be necessary for capturing or eating squid , as well @-@ fed animals have been found without teeth or even with deformed jaws . One hypothesis is that the teeth are used in aggression between males . Mature males often show scars which seem to be caused by the teeth . Rudimentary teeth are also present in the upper jaw , but these rarely emerge into the mouth . Analyzing the teeth is the preferred method for determining a whale 's age . Like the age @-@ rings in a tree , the teeth build distinct layers of cementum and dentine as they grow . 
 = = = Brain = = = 
 The brain is the largest known of any modern or extinct animal , weighing on average about 7 @.@ 8 kilograms ( 17 lb ) , more than five times heavier than a human 's , and has a volume of about 8 @,@ 000 cm3 . Although larger brains generally correlate with higher intelligence , it is not the only factor . Elephants and dolphins also have larger brains than humans . The sperm whale has a lower encephalization quotient than many other whale and dolphin species , lower than that of non @-@ human anthropoid apes , and much lower than humans ' . 
 The sperm whale 's cerebrum is the largest in all <unk> , both in absolute and relative terms . The olfactory system is reduced , suggesting that the sperm whale has a poor sense of taste and smell . By contrast , the auditory system is enlarged . The pyramidal tract is poorly developed , reflecting the reduction of its limbs . 
 = = = Biological systems = = = 
 The sperm whale respiratory system has adapted to cope with drastic pressure changes when diving . The flexible ribcage allows lung collapse , reducing nitrogen intake , and metabolism can decrease to conserve oxygen . Between dives , the sperm whale surfaces to breathe for about eight minutes before diving again . Odontoceti ( toothed whales ) breathe air at the surface through a single , S @-@ shaped blowhole , which is extremely skewed to the left . Sperm whales spout ( breathe ) 3 – 5 times per minute at rest , increasing to 6 – 7 times per minute after a dive . The blow is a noisy , single stream that rises up to 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 6 ft ) or more above the surface and points forward and left at a 45 ° angle . On average , females and juveniles blow every 12 @.@ 5 seconds before dives , while large males blow every 17 @.@ 5 seconds before dives . A sperm whale killed 160 km ( 100 mi ) south of Durban , South Africa after a 1 @-@ hour , 50 @-@ minute dive was found with two dogfish ( <unk> sp . ) , usually found at the sea floor , in its belly . 
 The sperm whale has the longest intestinal system in the world , exceeding 300 m in larger specimens . Similar to ruminants the sperm whale has four stomachs . The first secretes no gastric juices and has very thick muscular walls to crush the food ( since whales cannot chew ) and resist the claw and sucker attacks of swallowed squid . The second stomach is larger and is where digestion takes place . <unk> squid beaks accumulate in the second stomach – as many as 18 @,@ 000 have been found in some dissected specimens . Most squid beaks are vomited by the whale , but some occasionally make it to the hindgut . Such beaks precipitate the formation of ambergris . 
 In 1959 , the heart of a 22 metric tons ( 24 short tons ) male taken by whalers was measured to be 116 kilograms ( 256 lb ) , about 0 @.@ 5 % of its total mass . The circulatory system has a number of specific adaptations for the aquatic environment . The diameter of the aortic arch increases as it leaves the heart . This bulbous expansion acts as a <unk> , ensuring a steady blood flow as the heart rate slows during diving . The arteries that leave the aortic arch are positioned symmetrically . There is no <unk> artery . There is no direct connection between the internal carotid artery and the vessels of the brain . Their circulatory system has adapted to dive at great depths , as much as 2 @,@ 250 metres ( 7 @,@ 382 ft ) . Myoglobin , which stores oxygen in muscle tissue , is much more abundant than in terrestrial animals . The blood has a high density of red blood cells , which contain oxygen @-@ carrying haemoglobin . The oxygenated blood can be directed towards only the brain and other essential organs when oxygen levels deplete . The spermaceti organ may also play a role by adjusting buoyancy ( see below ) . The arterial retia mirabilia are extraordinarily well @-@ developed . The complex arterial retia mirabilia of the sperm whale are more extensive and larger than those of any other cetacean . 
 = = = Senses = = = 
 = = = = Spermaceti organ and melon = = = = 
 Atop the whale 's skull is positioned a large complex of organs filled with a liquid mixture of fats and waxes called spermaceti . The purpose of this complex is to generate powerful and focused clicking sounds , which the sperm whale uses for echolocation and communication . 
 The spermaceti organ is like a large barrel of spermaceti . Its surrounding wall , known as the case , is extremely tough and fibrous . The case can hold within it up to 1 @,@ 900 litres of spermaceti . It is proportionately larger in males . This oil is a mixture of triglycerides and wax esters . The proportion of wax esters in the spermaceti organ increases with the age of the whale : 38 – 51 % in calves , 58 – 87 % in adult females , and 71 – 94 % in adult males . The spermaceti at the core of the organ has a higher wax content than the outer areas . The speed of sound in spermaceti is 2 @,@ 684 m / s ( at 40 kHz , 36 ° C ) , making it nearly twice as fast as in the oil in a dolphin 's melon . 
 Below the spermaceti organ lies the " junk " which consists of compartments of spermaceti separated by cartilage . It is analogous to the melon found in other toothed whales . The structure of the junk redistributes physical stress across the skull and may have evolved to protect the head during ramming . 
 Running through the head are two air passages . The left passage runs alongside the spermaceti organ and goes directly to the blowhole , whilst the right passage runs underneath the spermaceti organ and passes air through a pair of phonic lips and into the distal sac at the very front of the nose . The distal sac is connected to the blowhole and the terminus of the left passage . When the whale is submerged , it can close the blowhole , and air that passes through the phonic lips can circulate back to the lungs . The sperm whale , unlike other odontocetes , has only one pair of phonic lips , whereas all other toothed whales have two , and it is located at the front of the nose instead of behind the melon . 
 At the posterior end of this spermaceti complex is the frontal sac , which covers the concave surface of the cranium . The posterior wall of the frontal sac is covered with fluid – filled knobs , which are about 4 – 13 mm in diameter and separated by narrow grooves . The anterior wall is smooth . The knobbly surface reflects sound waves that come through the spermaceti organ from the phonic lips . The grooves between the knobs trap a film of air that is consistent whatever the orientation or depth of the whale , making it an excellent sound mirror . 
 The spermaceti organs may also help adjust the whale 's buoyancy . It is hypothesized that before the whale dives , cold water enters the organ , and it is likely that the blood vessels constrict , reducing blood flow , and , hence , temperature . The wax therefore solidifies and reduces in volume . The increase in specific density generates a down force of about 392 newtons ( 88 lbf ) and allows the whale to dive with less effort . During the hunt , oxygen consumption , together with blood vessel dilation , produces heat and melts the spermaceti , increasing its buoyancy and enabling easy surfacing . However , more recent work has found many problems with this theory including the lack of anatomical structures for the actual heat exchange . 
 Herman Melville 's fictional story Moby Dick suggests that the " case " containing the spermaceti serves as a battering ram for use in fights between males . Apart from a few famous instances such as the well @-@ documented sinking of the ships Essex and Ann Alexander by attackers estimated to weigh only one @-@ fifth as much as the ships , this hypothesis is not well supported in current scientific literature . 
 = = = = Eyes and vision = = = = 
 The sperm whale 's eye does not differ greatly from those of other toothed whales except in size . It is the largest among the toothed whales , weighing about 170 g . It is overall ellipsoid in shape , compressed along the visual axis , measuring about 7 × 7 × 3 cm . The cornea is elliptical and the lens is spherical . The sclera is very hard and thick , roughly 1 cm anteriorly and 3 cm posteriorly . There are no ciliary muscles . The choroid is very thick and contains a fibrous tapetum lucidum . Like other toothed whales , the sperm whale can retract and protrude its eyes thanks to a 2 @-@ cm @-@ thick retractor muscle attached around the eye at the equator . 
 According to <unk> and Harbison ( 2002 ) , sperm whales eyes afford good vision and sensitivity to light . They conjectured that sperm whales use vision to hunt squid , either by detecting silhouettes from below or by detecting bioluminescence . If sperm whales detect silhouettes , <unk> and Harbison suggested that they hunt upside down , allowing them to use the forward parts of the ventral visual fields for binocular vision . 
 = = = Sleeping = = = 
 For some time researchers have been aware that pods of sperm whales may sleep for short periods , assuming a vertical position with their heads just below or at the surface . A 2008 study published in Current Biology recorded evidence that whales may sleep with both sides of the brain . It appears that some whales may fall into a deep sleep for about 7 percent of the time , most often between 6 p.m. and midnight . 
 = = = Genetics = = = 
 Sperm whales have 21 pairs of chromosomes ( 2n = 42 ) . The genome of live whales can be examined by recovering shed skin . 
 = = Vocalization complex = = 
 = = = Mechanism = = = 
 When echolocating , the sperm whale emits a directionally focused beam of broadband clicks . Clicks are generated by forcing air through a pair of phonic lips ( also known as " monkey lips " or " museau de singe " ) at the front end of the nose , just below the blowhole . The sound then travels backwards along the length of the nose through the spermaceti organ . Most of the sound energy is then reflected off the frontal sac at the cranium and into the melon , whose lens @-@ like structure focuses it . Some of the sound will reflect back into the spermaceti organ and back towards the front of the whale 's nose , where it will be reflected through the spermaceti organ a third time . This back and forth reflection which happens on the scale of a few milliseconds creates a multi @-@ pulse click structure . This multi @-@ pulse click structure allows researchers to measure the whale 's spermaceti organ using only the sound of its clicks . Because the interval between pulses of a sperm whale 's click is related to the length of the sound producing organ , an individual whale 's click is unique to that individual . However , if the whale matures and the size of the spermaceti organ increases , the tone of the whale 's click will also change . The lower jaw is the primary reception path for the echoes . A continuous fat @-@ filled canal transmits received sounds to the inner ear . 
 The source of the air forced through the phonic lips is the right nasal passage . While the left nasal passage opens to the blow hole , the right nasal passage has evolved to supply air to the phonic lips . It is thought that the nostrils of the land @-@ based ancestor of the sperm whale migrated through evolution to their current functions , the left nostril becoming the blowhole and the right nostril becoming the phonic lips . 
 Air that passes through the phonic lips passes into the distal sac , then back down through the left nasal passage . This recycling of air allows the whale to continuously generate clicks for as long as it is submerged . 
 = = = Types of vocalization = = = 
 A creak is a rapid series of high @-@ frequency clicks that sounds somewhat like a creaky door hinge . It is typically used when homing in on prey . 
 A coda is a short pattern of 3 to 20 clicks that is used in social situations . They were once thought to be a way by which individuals identified themselves , but individuals have been observed producing multiple codas , and the same codas are used by multiple individuals . However , each click contains a physical signature which suggests that clicks can be used to identify individuals . Geographically separate pods exhibit distinct dialects . Large males are generally solitary and rarely produce codas . In breeding grounds , codas are almost entirely produced by adult females . Despite evidence that sperm whales share similar codas , it is still unknown whether sperm whales possess individually specific coda repertoires or whether individuals make codas at different rates . 
 Slow clicks are heard only in the presence of males ( it is not certain whether females occasionally make them ) . Males make a lot of slow clicks in breeding grounds ( 74 % of the time ) , both near the surface and at depth , which suggests they are primarily mating signals . Outside breeding grounds , slow clicks are rarely heard , and usually near the surface . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 = = = Distribution = = = 
 Sperm whales are among the most cosmopolitan species . They prefer ice @-@ free waters over 1 @,@ 000 metres ( 3 @,@ 300 ft ) deep . Although both sexes range through temperate and tropical oceans and seas , only adult males populate higher latitudes . 
 They are relatively abundant from the poles to the equator and are found in all the oceans . They inhabit the Mediterranean Sea , but not the Black Sea , while their presence in the Red Sea is uncertain . The shallow entrances to both the Black Sea and the Red Sea may account for their absence . The Black Sea 's lower layers are also anoxic and contain high concentrations of sulphur compounds such as hydrogen sulphide . 
 Populations are denser close to continental shelves and canyons . Sperm whales are usually found in deep , off @-@ shore waters , but may be seen closer to shore , in areas where the continental shelf is small and drops quickly to depths of 310 to 920 metres ( 1 @,@ 020 to 3 @,@ 020 ft ) . Coastal areas with significant sperm whale populations include the Azores and Dominica . In Asian waters , whales are also observed regularly in coastal waters in places such as Commander and Kuril Islands , Shiretoko Peninsula , off <unk> , vicinity to Tokyo Bay and Boso Peninsula to Izu and Izu Islands , Volcano Islands , Yakushima and <unk> Islands to Ryukyu Islands , Taiwan , Northern Mariana Islands , and so forth . Historical catch records suggest there could have been smaller aggression grounds in the Sea of Japan as well . 
 Grown males are known to enter surprisingly shallow bays to rest ( whales will be in state of rest during these occasions ) . There are unique , coastal groups reported from various areas among the globe such as Scotland , Shiretoko Peninsula , off Kaikoura , in Davao Gulf . Such costal groups were more abundant in pre @-@ whaling days . 
 = = = Diet = = = 
 Sperm whales usually dive between 300 to 800 metres ( 980 to 2 @,@ 620 ft ) , and sometimes 1 to 2 kilometres ( 3 @,@ 300 to 6 @,@ 600 ft ) , in search of food . Such dives can last more than an hour . They feed on several species , notably the giant squid , but also the colossal squid , octopuses , and fish like demersal rays , but their diet is mainly medium @-@ sized squid . Some prey may be taken accidentally while eating other items . Most of what is known about deep sea squid has been learned from specimens in captured sperm whale stomachs , although more recent studies analysed feces . One study , carried out around the Galápagos , found that squid from the genera Histioteuthis ( 62 % ) , <unk> ( 16 % ) , and <unk> ( 7 % ) weighing between 12 and 650 grams ( 0 @.@ 026 and 1 @.@ 433 lb ) were the most commonly taken . Battles between sperm whales and giant squid or colossal squid have never been observed by humans ; however , white scars are believed to be caused by the large squid . One study published in 2010 collected evidence that suggests that female sperm whales may collaborate when hunting Humboldt squid . Tagging studies have shown that sperm whales hunt upside down at the bottom of their deep dives . It is suggested that the whales can see the squid silhouetted above them against the dim surface light . 
 An older study , examining whales captured by the New Zealand whaling fleet in the Cook Strait region , found a 1 @.@ 69 : 1 ratio of squid to fish by weight . Sperm whales sometimes take <unk> and toothfish from long lines . Long @-@ line fishing operations in the Gulf of Alaska complain that sperm whales take advantage of their fishing operations to eat desirable species straight off the line , sparing the whales the need to hunt . However , the amount of fish taken is very little compared to what the sperm whale needs per day . Video footage has been captured of a large male sperm whale " bouncing " a long line , to gain the fish . Sperm whales are believed to prey on the megamouth shark , a rare and large deep @-@ sea species discovered in the 1970s . In one case , three sperm whales were observed attacking or playing with a megamouth . 
 The sharp beak of a consumed squid lodged in the whale 's intestine may lead to the production of ambergris , analogous to the production of pearls . The irritation of the intestines caused by squid beaks stimulates the secretion of this lubricant @-@ like substance . Sperm whales are prodigious feeders and eat around 3 % of their body weight per day . The total annual consumption of prey by sperm whales worldwide is estimated to be about 91 million tonnes ( 100 million short tons ) . In comparison , human consumption of seafood is estimated to be 115 million tonnes ( 127 million short tons ) . 
 Sperm whales hunt through echolocation . Their clicks are among the most powerful sounds in the animal kingdom ( see above ) . It has been hypothesised that it can stun prey with its clicks . Experimental studies attempting to duplicate this effect have been unable to replicate the supposed injuries , casting doubt on this idea . 
 It has been stated that sperm whales , as well as other large cetaceans , help fertilise the surface of the ocean by consuming nutrients in the depths and transporting those nutrients to the oceans ' surface when they defecate , an effect known as the whale pump . This fertilises phytoplankton and other plants on the surface of the ocean and contributes to ocean productivity and the drawdown of atmospheric carbon . 
 = = Life cycle = = 
 Sperm whales can live 70 years or more . They are a prime example of a species that has been K @-@ selected , meaning their reproductive strategy is associated with stable environmental conditions and comprises a low birth rate , significant parental aid to offspring , slow maturation , and high longevity . 
 How they choose mates has not been definitively determined . Males will fight with each other over females , and males will mate with multiple females , making them polygynous , but they do not dominate the group like a harem . Males do not provide paternal care to their offspring . 
 Females become fertile at around 9 years of age . The oldest pregnant female ever recorded was 41 years old . Gestation requires 14 to 16 months , producing a single calf . Sexually mature females give birth once every 4 to 20 years ( pregnancy rates were higher during the whaling era ) . Birth is a social event , as the mother and calf need others to protect them from predators . The other adults may jostle and bite the newborn in its first hours . 
 Lactation proceeds for 19 to 42 months , but calves , rarely , may suckle up to 13 years . Like other whales , the sperm whale 's milk has a higher fat content than that of terrestrial mammals : about 36 % , compared to 4 % in cow milk . This gives it a consistency similar to cottage cheese , which prevents it from dissolving in the water before the calf can eat it . It has an energy content of roughly 3 @,@ 840 kcal / kg , compared to just 640 kcal / kg in cow milk . Calves may be allowed to suckle from females other than their mothers . 
 Males become sexually mature at 18 years . Upon reaching sexual maturity , males move to higher latitudes , where the water is colder and feeding is more productive . Females remain at lower latitudes . Males reach their full size at about age 50 . 
 = = Social behaviour = = 
 = = = Relations within the species = = = 
 Adult males who are not breeding live solitary lives , whereas females and juvenile males live together in groups . The main driving force for the sexual segregation of adult sperm whales is scramble competition for mesopelagic squid . Females and their young remain in groups , while mature males leave their " natal unit " somewhere between 4 and 21 years of age . Mature males sometimes form loose bachelor groups with other males of similar age and size . As males grow older , they typically live solitary lives . Mature males have beached themselves together , suggesting a degree of cooperation which is not yet fully understood . The whales rarely , if ever , leave their group . 
 A social unit is a group of sperm whales who live and travel together over a period of years . Individuals rarely , if ever , join or leave a social unit . There is a huge variance in the size of social units . They are most commonly between six and nine individuals in size but can have more than twenty . Unlike orcas , sperm whales within a social unit show no significant tendency to associate with their genetic relatives . Females and calves spend about three quarters of their time foraging and a quarter of their time socializing . <unk> usually takes place in the afternoon . 
 When sperm whales socialize , they emit complex patterns of clicks called codas . They will spend much of the time rubbing against each other . Tracking of diving whales suggests that groups engage in herding of prey , similar to bait balls created by other species , though the research needs to be confirmed by tracking the prey . 
 = = = Relations with other species = = = 
 The most common natural predator of sperm whales is the orca , but pilot whales and false killer whales sometimes harass them . Orcas prey on target groups of females with young , usually making an effort to extract and kill a calf . The adults will protect their calves or an injured adult by encircling them . They may face inwards with their tails out ( the ' <unk> formation ' , named after the flower ) . The heavy and powerful tail of an adult whale can deliver lethal blows . Alternatively , they may face outwards ( the ' heads @-@ out formation ' ) . Other than sperm whales , southern right whales had been observed to perform similar formations . However , formations in non dangerous situations have been recorded as well . Early whalers exploited this behaviour , attracting a whole unit by injuring one of its members . If the orca pod is extremely large , its members may sometimes be able to kill adult female sperm whales . Solitary mature males are known to interfere and come to the aid of vulnerable groups nearby . Individual large mature male sperm whales have no non @-@ human predators , and are believed to be too large , powerful and aggressive to be threatened by orcas . In addition , male sperm whales have been observed to attack and intimidate orca pods . An incident was filmed from a long @-@ line trawler : an orca pod was systematically taking fish caught on the trawler 's long lines ( as the lines were being pulled into the ship ) when a male sperm whale appeared to repeatedly charge the orca pod in an attempt to drive them away ; it was speculated by the film crew that the sperm whale was attempting to access the same fish . The orcas employed a tail outward and tail slapping defensive position against the bull sperm whale similar to that used by female sperm whales against attacking orcas . 
 Sperm whales are not known for forging bonds with other species , but it was observed that a bottlenose dolphin with spinal deformity had been accepted into a pod of sperm whales . They are known to swim alongside other cetaceans such as humpback , fin , minke , pilot , and orca whales on occasion .

 Although the fossil record is poor , several extinct genera have been assigned to the clade Physeteroidea , which includes the last common ancestor of the modern sperm whale , pygmy sperm whales , dwarf sperm whales , and extinct <unk> . These fossils include <unk> , <unk> , <unk> , Aulophyseter , Orycterocetus , Scaldicetus , <unk> , <unk> and Acrophyseter . <unk> , found in Azerbaijan and dated to the late Oligocene ( about 28 to 23 million years ago ) , is the most primitive fossil that has been found which possesses sperm whale @-@ specific features such as an asymmetric rostrum ( " beak " or " snout " ) . Most sperm whale fossils date from the Miocene period , 23 to 5 million years ago . <unk> , from Argentina , has been dated to the early Miocene . Fossil sperm whales from the Middle Miocene include Aulophyseter , <unk> and Orycterocetus , all of which were found on the west coast of the United States , and Scaldicetus , found in Europe and Japan . Orycterocetus fossils have also been found in the North Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea , in addition to the west coast of the United States . <unk> , found in Europe , and Acrophyseter , from Peru , are dated to the late Miocene . 
 Fossil sperm whales differ from modern sperm whales in tooth count and the shape of the face and jaws . For example , Scaldicetus had a tapered rostrum . Genera from the Oligocene and early and middle Miocene , with the possible exception of Aulophyseter , had teeth in their upper jaws . Acrophyseter , from the late Miocene , also had teeth in both the upper and lower jaws as well as a short rostrum and an upward curving mandible ( lower jaw ) . These anatomical differences suggest that fossil species may not have necessarily been deep @-@ sea squid eaters like the modern sperm whale , but that some genera mainly ate fish . <unk> , dated from the middle to late Miocene and found in southern Italy , had teeth in both jaws and appears to have been adapted to feed on large prey , rather like the modern Orca ( Killer Whale ) . Other fossil sperm whales with adaptations similar to this are collectively known as killer sperm whales . 
 = = = Phylogeny = = = 
 The traditional view has been that Mysticeti ( baleen whales ) and Odontoceti ( toothed whales ) arose from more primitive whales early in the Oligocene period , and that the super @-@ family Physeteroidea , which contains the sperm whale , dwarf sperm whale , and pygmy sperm whale , diverged from other toothed whales soon after that , over 23 million years ago . From 1993 to 1996 , molecular phylogenetics analyses by <unk> and colleagues , based on comparing the genes of various modern whales , suggested that the sperm whales are more closely related to the baleen whales than they are to other toothed whales , which would have meant that Odontoceti were not monophyletic ; in other words , it did not consist of a single ancestral toothed whale species and all its descendants . However , more recent studies , based on various combinations of comparative anatomy and molecular phylogenetics , criticised <unk> 's analysis on technical grounds and reaffirmed that the Odontoceti are monophyletic . 
 These analyses also confirm that there was a rapid evolutionary radiation ( diversification ) of the Physeteroidea in the Miocene period . The Kogiidae ( dwarf and pygmy sperm whales ) diverged from the Physeteridae ( true sperm whales ) at least 8 million years ago .

 Spermaceti , obtained primarily from the spermaceti organ , and sperm oil , obtained primarily from the blubber in the body , were much sought after by eighteenth , nineteenth , and twentieth century whalers . These substances found a variety of commercial applications , such as candles , soap , cosmetics , machine oil , other specialised lubricants , lamp oil , pencils , crayons , leather waterproofing , rust @-@ proofing materials and many pharmaceutical compounds . Ambergris , a solid , waxy , flammable substance produced in the digestive system of sperm whales , was also sought as a fixative in perfumery . 
 Prior to the early eighteenth century , hunting was mostly by indigenous Indonesians . Legend has it that sometime in the early eighteenth century , around 1712 , Captain Christopher Hussey , while cruising for right whales near shore , was blown offshore by a northerly wind , where he encountered a sperm whale pod and killed one . Although the story may not be true , sperm whales were indeed soon exploited by American whalers . Judge Paul Dudley , in his Essay upon the Natural History of Whales ( 1725 ) , states that one Atkins , ten or twelve years in the trade , was among the first to catch sperm whales sometime around 1720 off the New England coast . 
 There were only a few recorded catches during the first few decades ( 1709 – 1730s ) of offshore sperm whaling . Instead , sloops concentrated on Nantucket Shoals , where they would have taken right whales or went to the Davis Strait region to catch bowhead whales . By the early 1740s , with the advent of spermaceti candles ( before 1743 ) , American vessels began to focus on sperm whales . The diary of Benjamin Bangs ( 1721 – 1769 ) shows that , along with the bumpkin sloop he sailed , he found three other sloops flensing sperm whales off the coast of North Carolina in late May 1743 . On returning to Nantucket in the summer 1744 on a subsequent voyage , he noted that " 45 <unk> are brought in here this day , " another indication that American sperm whaling was in full swing . 
 American sperm whaling soon spread from the east coast of the American colonies to the Gulf Stream , the Grand Banks , West Africa ( 1763 ) , the Azores ( 1765 ) , and the South Atlantic ( 1770s ) . From 1770 to 1775 Massachusetts , New York , Connecticut , and Rhode Island ports produced 45 @,@ 000 barrels of sperm oil annually , compared to 8 @,@ 500 of whale oil . In the same decade , the British began sperm whaling , employing American ships and personnel . By the following decade , the French had entered the trade , also employing American expertise . Sperm whaling increased until the mid @-@ nineteenth century . Spermaceti oil was important in public lighting ( for example , in lighthouses , where it was used in the United States until 1862 , when it was replaced by lard oil , in turn replaced by petroleum ) and for lubricating the machines ( such as those used in cotton mills ) of the Industrial Revolution . Sperm whaling declined in the second half of the nineteenth century , as petroleum came into broader use . In that sense , petroleum use may be said to have protected whale populations from even greater exploitation . Sperm whaling in the eighteenth century began with small sloops carrying only one or two whaleboats . The fleet 's scope and size increased over time , and larger ships entered the fishery . In the late eighteenth century and early nineteenth century sperm whaling ships sailed to the equatorial Pacific , the Indian Ocean , Japan , the coast of Arabia , Australia and New Zealand . Hunting could be dangerous to the crew , since sperm whales ( especially bulls ) will readily fight to defend themselves against attack , unlike most baleen whales . When dealing with a threat , sperm whales will use their huge head effectively as a battering ram . Arguably the most famous sperm whale counter @-@ attack occurred on 20 November 1820 , when a whale claimed to be about 25 @.@ 9 metres ( 85 ft ) long rammed and sank the Nantucket whaleship Essex . Only 8 out of 21 sailors survived to be rescued by other ships . This instance is popularly believed to have inspired Herman Melville 's famous book Moby @-@ Dick . 
 The sperm whale 's ivory @-@ like teeth were often sought by eighteenth- and nineteenth @-@ century whalers , who used them to produce inked carvings known as scrimshaw . Thirty teeth of the sperm whale can be used for ivory . Each of these teeth , up to 20 cm ( 8 in ) and 8 cm ( 3 in ) across , are hollow for the first half of their length . Like walrus ivory , sperm whale ivory has two distinct layers . However , sperm whale ivory contains a much thicker inner layer . Though a widely practised art in the nineteenth century , scrimshaw using genuine sperm whale ivory declined substantially after the retirement of the whaling fleets in the 1880s . Currently the Endangered Species Act and the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora ( CITES ) , prevents the sales of or trade in sperm whale ivory harvested after 1973 or scrimshaw crafted from it . 
 Modern whaling was more efficient than open @-@ boat whaling , employing steam @-@ powered ships and exploding harpoons . Initially , modern whaling activity focused on large baleen whales , but as these populations were taken , sperm whaling increased . Spermaceti , the fine waxy oil produced by sperm whales , was in high demand . In both the 1941 to 1942 and 1942 to 1943 seasons , Norwegian expeditions took over 3 @,@ 000 sperm whales off the coast of Peru alone . After the war , whaling continued unabated to obtain oil for cosmetics and high @-@ performance machinery , such as automobile transmissions . 
 The hunting led to the near extinction of large whales , including sperm whales , until bans on whale oil use were instituted in 1972 . The International Whaling Commission gave the species full protection in 1985 but hunting by Japan in the northern Pacific Ocean continued until 1988 . 
 It is estimated that the historic worldwide population numbered 1 @,@ 100 @,@ 000 before commercial sperm whaling began in the early eighteenth century . By 1880 it had declined by an estimated 29 percent . From that date until 1946 , the population appears to have partially recovered as whaling activity decreased , and after World War II , the whale population increases to 33 percent of the pre @-@ whaling population . Between 184 @,@ 000 and 236 @,@ 000 sperm whales were killed by the various whaling nations in the nineteenth century , while in the twentieth century , at least 770 @,@ 000 were taken , the majority between 1946 and 1980 . 
 Sperm whales increase levels of primary production and carbon export by depositing iron @-@ rich faeces into surface waters of the Southern Ocean . The iron @-@ rich faeces cause phytoplankton to grow and take up more carbon from the atmosphere . When the phytoplankton dies , it sinks to the deep ocean and takes the atmospheric carbon with it . By reducing the abundance of sperm whales in the Southern Ocean , whaling has resulted in an extra 2 million tonnes of carbon remaining in the atmosphere each year . 
 Remaining sperm whale populations are large enough that the species ' conservation status is rated as vulnerable rather than endangered . However , the recovery from centuries of commercial whaling is a slow process , particularly in the South Pacific , where the toll on breeding @-@ age males was severe . 
 = = = Current conservation status = = = 
 The total number of sperm whales in the world is unknown , but is thought to be in the hundreds of thousands . The conservation outlook is brighter than for many other whales . Commercial whaling has ceased , and the species is protected almost worldwide , though records indicate that in the eleven @-@ year period starting from 2000 , Japan has caught 51 sperm whales . Fishermen do not target the creatures sperm whales eat , but long @-@ line fishing operations in the Gulf of Alaska have complained about sperm whales stealing fish from their lines .
