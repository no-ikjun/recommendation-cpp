 An evaluation of an individual 's abilities , limitations and communication needs is necessary to select appropriate AAC techniques . The purpose of the assessment is to identify potential AAC approaches that can bridge discrepancies between a potential user 's current communication and their present and future communication needs . AAC evaluations are often conducted by specialized teams which may include a speech @-@ language pathologist , occupational therapist , rehabilitation engineer , physiotherapist , social worker and a physician . Users , family members and teachers are also key members of the decision making team . Sensitivity to and respect of cultural diversity contributes to ongoing family involvement and to the selection of the most appropriate AAC system . For members of some cultural groups the presence of an AAC device increases the visibility of disability and is thus viewed as stigmatizing . 
 A user 's motor abilities , communication skills and needs , cognition and vision are assessed in order to determine the most appropriate match to a communication system . Depending on the individual 's physical status , recommendations of an alternative access method , a change in seating / positioning , a mounting system and / or communication aid adaptations may be needed . For example , someone with spastic arm movements may require a key guard on top of the keyboard or touchscreen to reduce the selection of non @-@ target items . The person 's needs and abilities determine the symbols chosen and their organization , with the goal being that the communication system can be used as efficiently as possible in different contexts , with different communication partners , and for different social purposes . Researcher Janice Light identified four social purposes of communicative interaction in AAC : the expression of needs and wants to a listener , the transfer of information as in more general conversation , the development of social closeness through such things as jokes and cheering , and finally social etiquette practices such as " please " and " thank you " . These four purposes vary in terms of the relative importance of the content , rate , duration and the focus of the interaction . It is important that the AAC systems selected also reflect the priorities of the individual and their family . In Western cultures , professionals may see a communication device as helping to promote an individual 's self @-@ determination , i.e. , the ability to make one 's own decisions and choices . However , cultural and religious factors may affect the degree to which individual autonomy is a valued construct , and influence family attitudes towards AAC . 
 Training can help the user make use of their AAC system to communicate effectively with others , to control their environment through communication , and to make choices , decisions and mistakes . Skilled users of AAC show communicative competence in four interrelated areas : linguistic , operational , social and strategic . Linguistic competence refers to language skills in the person 's native language as well as the linguistic code of the symbol system selected . Operational competence involves the skills in the use and maintenance of the tool of communication , while social competence and strategic competence reflect knowledge and judgment in communicative interactions , including the compensations required for a slow speaking rate , communication breakdowns and those unfamiliar with AAC . An AAC user may require specific device programming and / or training to achieve competency in these areas . 
 Communication partners may also require training to notice and consistently interpret the communication signals of a severely disabled individual , particularly because there is a danger that learned helplessness can be the result of repeated failure to communicate successfully . Parties may need assistance to avoid the directive communication style that can lead a child user of AAC not to develop a full range of communication skills such as initiating or taking the lead in conversation , using complex syntax , asking questions , making commands or adding new information . Young AAC users benefit from rich language and literacy experiences to foster vocabulary development , discourse skills , and phonological awareness , all of which supports successful literacy learning . Communication partners are encouraged to provide augmented input with the child , such as signing or pointing to symbols and codes as they communicate , including using the individual 's communication system themselves . They also benefit from focussed and explicit reading instruction . 
 = = Outcomes = = 
 = = = Speech = = = 
 Several reviews have found that the use of AAC does not impede the development of speech in individuals with autism or developmental disabilities , and in fact may result in modest gains being observed . A 2006 research review of 23 AAC intervention studies found gains in speech production in 89 % of the cases studied , with the remainder showing no change . A descriptive review looking specifically at Picture Exchange Communication System ( PECS ) intervention studies found that several studies reported an increase in speech , often during later phases , while one noted little or no effect . 
 Researchers hypothesize that using an AAC device relieves the pressure of having to speak , allowing the individual to focus on communication , and that the reduction in psychological stress makes speech production easier . Others speculate that in the case of speech generating devices , the model of spoken output leads to an increase in speech production . 
 = = = Language and literacy = = = 
 Language and literacy have far reaching effects as they facilitate self @-@ expression and social interaction in a variety of settings . Furthermore , literacy fosters independence by providing access to educational and vocational opportunities . Children whose disabilities require AAC often experience developmental delays in language skills such as vocabulary knowledge , length of sentences , syntax , and impaired pragmatic skills . These delays may be due in part to the fact that expressive language is limited by more than the children 's own language knowledge . Unlike speaking children , children who use AAC do not always have access to their AAC system , and don 't select the content available on the device . These external characteristics may impact language learning opportunities . Most children in this category do not achieve literacy skills beyond that of a typically developing 7 – 8 year old . Cognitive , language and learning delays contribute to difficulty with literacy development , but environmental factors also play a role . The most literate AAC users often report having access to abundant reading and writing material at home as well as in school during childhood . Studies have shown that many children who use AAC have literacy experiences that are reduced quality , quantity , and opportunity at home and at school as compared to children without disabilities . Research suggests that with explicit reading instruction , AAC users can develop good literacy skills . 
 = = = Employment = = = 
 According to a 1997 U.S. Census Bureau report less than 10 % of severely disabled individuals were employed . Despite the various barriers to employment , some AAC users achieve success in educational endeavours and employment , though often in lower paying jobs . Factors that have been found to be related to employment are a strong work ethic and access to AAC technology , the support of family and friends , education , and work skills . Individuals with ALS who use AAC may continue working ; factors supporting continued employment include access to AAC , support from employers , governmental programs and others . Employers of AAC users report that skills in time management , problem solving , communication , technology and a good education are important to employers . 
 = = = Quality of life = = = 
 Several studies of young adults who had used AAC since childhood report a generally good quality of life , though few lived independently , or were in paid employment . The young adults used multiple modes of communication including aided and unaided AAC approaches . More positive quality of life outcomes often correlated with better quality of communication and interaction , as well as personal characteristics , family and community support , and excellent AAC services . Poorer outcomes were related to lack of access to appropriate AAC supports and resources , problems with technology and negative attitudes . 
 = = Specific groups of AAC users = = 
 = = = Cerebral palsy = = = 
 Cerebral palsy is a term referring to a non @-@ progressive developmental <unk> disorder with an upper motor neuron lesion origin . Depending on the location of the brain lesion , individuals with cerebral palsy can have a wide variety of gross and fine motor challenges , including different forms and areas of the body affected . Fine motor planning , control and coordination are often affected . <unk> , a speech disorder resulting from neurological damage to the motor @-@ speech system , occurs in an estimated 31 % to 88 % of those with cerebral palsy . Such individuals may require AAC support for communication . Approximately one half to one third have some degree of intellectual impairment , and visual and hearing problems are also common . Gross and fine motor challenges are often of particular concern in accessing an AAC device . Appropriate seating and positioning are important to facilitate optimum stability and movement . Extensive motor training and practice may be required to develop efficient AAC access and use . 
 = = = Intellectual impairment = = = 
 Individuals with intellectual impairments face challenges in developing communication skills , including problems with generalization ( the transfer of learned skills into daily activities ) . They may lack communication opportunities in their daily lives , and responsive communicators who understand their communication methods . AAC intervention for this population emphasizes partner training as well as opportunities for integrated , natural communication . Studies have shown that appropriate use of AAC techniques with children and adults with intellectual impairments can enhance communication skills , increase participation in activities , choice @-@ making , and even influence the perceptions and stereotypes of communication partners . 
 While most individuals with intellectual disabilities do not have concomitant behavioural issues , problems in this area are typically more prevalent in this population than others . AAC approaches may be used as part of teaching functional communication skills to non @-@ speaking individuals as an alternative to " acting out " for the purpose of exerting independence , taking control , or informing preferences . 
 = = = Autism = = = 
 Autism is a disorder of neural development characterized by impaired social interaction and communication , and by restricted and repetitive behaviour . Typically there is particular difficulty acquiring expressive communication skills . Children with autism have been found to have strong visual processing skills , making them good candidates for an AAC approach . AAC intervention in this population is directed towards the linguistic and social abilities of the child , including providing the child with a concrete means of communication , as well as facilitating the development of <unk> skills . 
 AAC systems for this population generally begin with communication boards and / or object or picture exchanges such as the Picture Exchange Communication System ( PECS ) . A 2009 descriptive review provided preliminary evidence that PECS is easily learned by most individuals with autism , provides communication to those with little or no functional speech , and has some limited positive impact on social interaction and challenging behaviours . A study that compared the use of a speech generating device to a picture exchange system found that both were reasonable options for children with autism , as the ease and speed of acquisition of each system was similar . 
 = = = Developmental verbal dyspraxia = = = 
 Developmental verbal dyspraxia , also known as Childhood apraxia of speech , is a developmental motor speech disorder involving impairments in the motor control of speech production . The speech of a child with developmental verbal dyspraxia may be unintelligible to the point that daily communication needs cannot be met . A child with developmental verbal dyspraxia often experiences great amounts of frustration , so AAC can be a strategy to support communication alongside more traditional speech therapy to improve speech production . 
 A wide variety of AAC systems have been used with children with developmental verbal dyspraxia . Manual signs or gestures are frequent introduced to these children , and can include the use of fingerspelling alongside speech . Manual signs have been shown to decrease errors in articulation . Aided AAC systems typically include communication boards and speech generating devices . A multimodal approach is often used , with several AAC approaches introduced so that the child can take advantage of the most effective method for a particular situation . 
 = = = Traumatic brain injury = = = 
 Traumatic brain injury can result in severe motor speech disorders ; dysarthria is the most common such disorder , accounting for roughly a third of all cases . Depending on the stage of recovery , AAC intervention may involve identifying consistent communication signals , the facilitation of reliable yes / no responses to questions , and the ability to express basic needs and answer questions . Individuals who do not recover natural speech to a degree sufficient to meet their communication needs typically suffer from severe impairments related to cognition . Difficulties with memory and learning new skills may influence AAC choices ; well @-@ established competencies such as spelling may be more effective than AAC systems that require navigation through multiple pages to access information . 
 = = = Aphasia = = = 
 Aphasia is the result of damage to the brain 's language centres affecting production , comprehension , or both , and can cause severe , chronic language impairment . Individuals with aphasia often communicate using a combination of speech , gestures , and aided communication ; the proportion of each may change as the person recovers , and depends on the context and the individual 's skills . 
 Depending on their language and cognitive skills , those with aphasia may use AAC interventions such as communication and memory books , drawing , photography , written words , speech generating devices and keyboards . Visual scene displays have been used on communication devices with adults who have chronic , severe aphasia ; these feature photos of people , places or events that are meaningful to the individual and <unk> of communicative interaction . Approaches such as " Supported Conversation for Adults with Aphasia " train the communication partners to use resources such as writing key words , providing written choices , drawing , and using items such as photographs and maps to help the individual with aphasia produce and comprehend conversation . Communication boards can be very helpful for patients with aphasia , especially with patients who are very severe . They can be produced at a very low tech level , and can be utilized by patients to point to pictures / words they are trying to say . Communication boards are extremely functional and help patients with aphasia communicate their needs . 
 = = = Locked @-@ in syndrome = = = 
 Strokes that occur in the brainstem may cause profound deficits , including locked @-@ in syndrome , in which cognitive , emotional and linguistic abilities remain intact but all or almost all voluntary motor abilities are lost . Most people affected by this type of stroke rely on AAC strategies to communicate , since few recover intelligible speech or functional voice . The AAC strategies used vary with the individual 's preferences and motor capabilities which may change over time . As eye movements are most likely to be preserved , eye blinks are frequently used for communication . Low @-@ tech alphabet boards are often introduced immediately to provide the individual with basic communication . Partner @-@ assisted scanning may be used , in which the AAC user signals when the desired letter is named by a communication partner . When vertical and horizontal eye movements are functional , a transparent alphabet board may be used in which the AAC user looks at the desired letter and this is acknowledged by the communication partner . Individuals with locked @-@ in syndrome have difficulty using high @-@ tech devices due to issues with motor control , vision , memory , alertness and linguistic ability . In particular , a voluntary , reliable and easily controlled muscle movement is necessary to access such a device , such as head , jaw , hand or finger movements . In some individuals , intensive practice , even long after the initial stroke , has been shown to increase the accuracy and consistency of head movements , which can be used to access a communication device . 
 = = = Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis = = = 
 Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) or Motor Neurone Disease ( MND ) is a progressive condition which leads to weakness and eventual paralysis . Approximately 75 % of people with ALS are unable to speak by the time of their death . In a procedure known as voice banking , people with ALS may digitally record words and phrases while still able to do so , for later inclusion in a communication device . AAC systems used typically change over time depending on severity of speech impairment , physical status , and the individual 's communication needs . Use of augmentative communication strategies generally begins when speaking rate drops to 100 words per minute . In the early stages , AAC may consist of using an alphabet board to cue the listener to the first letter of the word being spoken , and may be used with those less familiar with the individual . In the later stages , AAC often becomes the main communicative method , although familiar conversation partners may still understand some spoken words . Since cognition and vision are typically unaffected in ALS , writing @-@ based systems are preferred to graphic symbols , as they allow the unlimited expression of all words in a language . 
 The method of access to a communication device depends on the type and severity of the disease . In the spinal form of ALS , the limbs are affected from the onset of the disease ; in these cases a head mouse or eye tracking access may be used initially . In the bulbar form , speech is affected before the limbs ; here handwriting and typing on keyboard @-@ style devices are frequently the first forms of AAC . AAC users may change access methods as the disease progresses . Low @-@ tech systems , such as eye gazing or partner assisted scanning , are used in situations when electronic devices are unavailable ( for example , during bathing ) and in the final stages of the disease . 
 = = = Parkinson 's disease = = = 
 Parkinson 's disease is a progressive neurological condition in which dysarthria may develop later in the progression of the disease . Some individuals eventually lose all functional speech . AAC approaches are generally used to supplement and support natural speech . A portable amplifier , for example , may be used to increase the volume of speech and thus its intelligibility . The individual may be taught to point to the first letter of each word they say on an alphabet board , leading to a reduced speech rate and visual cues for the listener to compensate for impaired articulation . Entire words can be spelled out if necessary . In users that have reduced range and speed of movement , a smaller than usual selection display may be preferred . High @-@ tech AAC keyboard speech @-@ generating devices are also used ; <unk> may be required to prevent accidental keystrokes caused by the tremor typical of the disease . Factors affecting AAC use in Parkinson 's disease include motor deficits and cognitive changes ; the latter may result in unawareness of their problems with spoken communication . 
 = = = Multiple sclerosis = = = 
 <unk> is the most common communication problem in individuals with multiple sclerosis ( MS ) , however , significant difficulties with speech and intelligibility are uncommon . Individuals with MS vary widely in their motor control capacity and the presence of intention tremor , and methods of access to AAC technology are adapted accordingly . Visual impairments are common in MS and may necessitate approaches using auditory scanning systems , large @-@ print text , or synthetic speech feedback that plays back words and letters as they are typed . 
 = = = Dementia = = = 
 Dementia is an acquired , chronic , cognitive impairment characterized by deficits in memory and other cognitive domains . Communication impairments are partly attributed to memory deficits , and AAC intervention may be used to compensate for deficits and to capitalize on the person 's strengths , such as the ability to recognize material they cannot recall . Low @-@ tech devices are generally preferred , such as memory books that include autobiographical information , daily schedules , photographs , and reminders or labels . Several studies have shown positive outcomes in the amount of on @-@ topic conversation and the length of interaction with these approaches . The gains were maintained four months after the training in the use of the memory aids had ceased . High @-@ tech devices with voice output have been found to be less effective ; in one study devices resulted in limited topic elaboration / initiation , reduced output and heightened distraction . AAC is also used to enhance the comprehension of those with dementia . The use of augmented listening strategies , such as identifying topics of conversation with pictures , improves the conversational skills of individuals with dementia . 
 = = History = = 
 The history of AAC can be traced to the days of classical Rome and Greece , with the first recorded use of augmentative strategies with the deaf . The use of manual alphabets and signs was recorded in Europe from the 16th century , as was the gestural system of Hand Talk used by Native Americans to facilitate communication between different linguistic groups . The first known widely available communication aid was a letter and word @-@ based communication board developed for , and with , F. Hall Roe , who had cerebral palsy . This communication board was distributed in the 1920s by a men 's group in Minneapolis . 
 The modern era of AAC began in the 1950s in Europe and North America , spurred by several societal changes ; these included an increased awareness of individuals with communication and other disabilities , and a growing commitment , often backed by government legislation and funding , to develop their education , independence and rights . In the early years , AAC was primarily used with laryngectomy and <unk> cases , and later with individuals with cerebral palsy and aphasia . It was typically only employed after traditional speech therapy had failed , as many felt hesitant to provide non @-@ speech intervention to those who might be able to learn to speak . Individuals with intellectual impairment were not provided with AAC support because it was believed that they did not possess the prerequisite skills for AAC . The main systems used were manual signs , communication boards and Morse code , though in the early 1960s , an electric communication device in the form of a sip @-@ and @-@ puff typewriter controller named the Patient Operated Selector Mechanism ( <unk> or POSSUM ) was developed in the United Kingdom . 
 From the 1960s onward , sign language increased in acceptance and use in the Deaf community , and AAC also came to be viewed as acceptable for those with other diagnoses . Manual sign languages , such as <unk> , were advocated for those with both hearing and cognitive impairments , and later for those with intellectual impairment or autism with normal hearing . Research into whether primates could learn to sign or use graphic symbols spurred further interest the use of AAC with those with cognitive impairments . The use of Amer @-@ Ind hand signals opened the field to AAC techniques specifically for adult users . 
 <unk> were first used in Canada in 1971 to provide communication to those not able to use traditional orthography ; their use quickly spread to other countries . With improved technology , keyboard communication devices developed in Denmark , the Netherlands and the US increased in portability ; the typed messages were displayed on a screen or strip of paper . By the end of the 1970s , communication devices were being commercially produced , and a few , such as the <unk> , had voice output . Countries such as Sweden , Canada and the United Kingdom initiated government @-@ funded services for those with severe communication impairments , including developing centres of clinical and research expertise . 
 The late 1970s and 1980s saw a massive increase of AAC @-@ related research , publications , and training as well the first national and international conferences . The International Society for Alternative and Augmentative Communication ( ISAAC ) was founded in 1983 ; its members included clinicians , teachers , rehabilitation engineers , researchers , and AAC users themselves . The organization has since played an important role in developing the field through its peer @-@ reviewed journal , conferences , national chapters and its focus on AAC in developing countries . AAC became an area of professional specialization ; a 1981 American Speech @-@ Language @-@ Hearing Association position paper , for example , recognized AAC as a field of practice for speech @-@ language pathologists . At the same time , AAC users and family members played an increasing prominent role in the development of knowledge of AAC through their writing and presentations , by serving on committees and founding advocacy organizations . 
 From the 1980s , improvements in technology led to a greatly increased number , variety , and performance of commercially available communication devices , and a reduction in their size and price . Alternative methods of access such eye pointing or scanning became available on communication devices . Speech output possibilities included digitized and synthesized speech , with text @-@ to @-@ speech options available in German , French , Italian , Spanish , Swedish and Ewe . AAC services became more holistic , seeking to develop a balance of aided and unaided strategies with the goal of improving functioning in the person 's daily life , and greater involvement of the family . Increasingly , individuals with acquired conditions such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , Parkinson 's disease , head injury , and locked @-@ in syndrome , received AAC services . In addition , with the challenge to the notion of AAC prerequisites , those with severe to profound intellectual impairments began to be served . Courses on AAC were developed for professional training programs , and literature such as textbooks and guides were written to support students , clinicians and parents . 
 The 1990s brought a focus on greater independence for people with disabilities , and more inclusion in mainstream society . In schools , students with special needs were placed in regular classrooms rather than segregated settings , which led to an increased use of AAC as a means of improving student participation in class . Interventions became more collaborative and naturalistic , taking place in the classroom with the teacher , rather than in a therapy room . Facilitated communication – a method by which a facilitator physically and emotionally supports a person with severe communication needs as they type on a keyboard or letter board – received wide attention in the media and in the field . The question of the authorship made the approach controversial ; most of the subsequent research indicated that the facilitators were unknowingly influencing the messages typed . As a result , professional organizations and AAC researchers and clinicians have not typically accepted facilitated communication . 
 Rapid progress in hardware and software development continued , including projects funded by the European Community . The first commercially available dynamic screen speech generating devices were developed in the 1990s . At the same time synthesized speech was becoming available in more languages . Software programs were developed that allowed the computer @-@ based production of communication boards . High @-@ tech devices have continued to reduce in size and weight , while increasing accessibility and capacities . Modern communication devices can also enable users to access the internet and some can be used as environmental control devices for independent access of TV , radio , telephone etc . 
 Future directions for AAC focus on improving device interfaces , reducing the cognitive and linguistic demands of AAC , and the barriers to effective social interaction . AAC researchers have challenged manufacturers to develop communication devices that are more appealing aesthetically , with greater options for leisure and play and that are easier to use . The rapid advances in smartphone and tablet computer technologies has the potential to radically change the availability of economical , accessible , flexible communication devices ; however , the user interfaces are needed that meet the various physical and cognitive challenges of AAC users . Android and other open source operating systems , provide opportunities for small communities , such as AAC , to develop the accessibility features and software required . Other promising areas of development include the access of communication devices using signals from movement recognition technologies that interpret body motions , or electrodes measuring brain activity , and the automatic transcription of <unk> speech using speech recognition systems . <unk> @-@ based systems , in which frequent utterances are organized in sets to improve the speed of communication exchange , are also in development . Similarly , research has focussed on the provision of timely access to vocabulary and conversation appropriate for specific interactions . Natural language generation techniques have been investigated , including the use of logs of past conversations with conversational partners , data from a user 's schedule and from real @-@ time Internet vocabulary searches , as well as information about location from global positioning systems and other sensors . However , despite the frequent focus on technological advances in AAC , practitioners are urged to retain the focus on the communication needs of the AAC users : " The future for AAC will not be driven by advances in technology , but rather by how well we can take advantage of those advancements for the enhancement of communicative opportunities for individuals who have complex communication needs " . 
 = 1st Cavalry Division ( Kingdom of Yugoslavia ) = 
 The 1st Cavalry Division was a horsed cavalry formation of the Royal Yugoslav Army that formed part of the Yugoslav 1st Army Group during the German @-@ led Axis invasion of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia in April 1941 . In peacetime , the division consisted of two cavalry brigades commanding a total of four cavalry regiments , but its wartime organisation specified one cavalry brigade commanding two or three cavalry regiments , along with divisional @-@ level combat and supporting units . 
 Along with the rest of the Yugoslav Army , the 1st Cavalry Division began mobilising on 3 April 1941 , and was still engaged in that process three days later when the Germans began an air campaign and a series of preliminary operations against the Yugoslav frontiers . By the end of the following day , the division 's cavalry brigade headquarters and all of the division 's cavalry regiments had been detached for duty with other formations of the 1st Army Group . The divisional headquarters and divisional @-@ level units remained in the vicinity of Zagreb until 10 April , when they were given orders to establish a defensive line southeast of Zagreb along the Sava river , with infantry and artillery support . The division had only begun to deploy for this task when the German 14th Panzer Division captured Zagreb . The divisional headquarters and all attached units were then disarmed by armed Croat fifth column groups , or surrendered to German troops . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Royal Yugoslav Army ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : Vojska Kraljevine Jugoslavije , VKJ ) was formed after World War I as the army of the Kingdom of Serbs , Croats and Slovenes ( Kingdom of SCS ) , when that country was created on 1 December 1918 . To defend the new kingdom , an army was formed around the nucleus of the victorious Royal Serbian Army combined with armed formations raised in the former parts of the Austro @-@ Hungarian Empire that joined with the Kingdom of Serbia to form the new state . Many former Austro @-@ Hungarian officers and soldiers became members of the new army . From its beginning , the army , like other aspects of public life in the new kingdom , was dominated by ethnic Serbs , who saw the army as a means by which to secure Serb hegemony in the new kingdom . 
 The development of the army was hampered by the poor economy of the kingdom , and this continued through the 1920s . In 1929 , King Alexander changed the name of the country to the Kingdom of Yugoslavia , at which time the army became the VKJ . The army budget remained tight , and as tensions rose across Europe during the 1930s , it became hard to secure weapons and munitions from other countries . Consequently , at the time World War II broke out in September 1939 , the VKJ had several serious weaknesses , which included reliance on draught animals for transport , and the large size of its formations . For example , infantry divisions had a wartime strength of 26 @,@ 000 – 27 @,@ 000 men , as compared to contemporary British infantry divisions of half that strength . These characteristics resulted in slow , unwieldy formations , and the inadequate supply of arms and munitions meant that even the very large Yugoslav formations had low firepower . Older generals better suited to the trench warfare of World War I were combined with an army that was not equipped or trained to resist the fast @-@ moving combined arms approach used by the Germans in Poland and France . 
 The weaknesses of the VKJ in strategy , structure , equipment , mobility and supply were exacerbated to a significant degree by the lack of unity across Yugoslavia which had resulted from two decades of Serb hegemony , and the attendant lack of political legitimacy achieved by the central government . Attempts to address the lack of unity came too late to ensure that the VKJ was a cohesive force . Fifth column activity was also a serious concern , not only from the Croatian nationalist Ustaše , but from the Slovene and ethnic German minorities in the country . 
 = = Structure = = 
 = = = Peacetime organisation = = = 
 According to regulations issued by the Royal Yugoslav Army in 1935 , the 1st Cavalry Division was headquartered in Zagreb during peacetime , and was under the control of Cavalry Command in Belgrade , as was the 2nd Cavalry Division , which was located in southeastern Yugoslavia at Niš . In peacetime , the 1st Cavalry Division comprised : 
 1st Cavalry Brigade , headquartered in Čakovec near Zagreb 
 2nd Cavalry Brigade , headquartered in Subotica in the Banat north of Belgrade 
 2nd Cavalry Regiment , based in Virovitica on the Drava river in Slavonia 
 3rd Cavalry Regiment , based in Subotica 
 6th Cavalry Regiment , based in Zagreb 
 8th Cavalry Regiment , based in Čakovec 
 = = = Wartime organisation = = = 
 The wartime organisation of the Royal Yugoslav Army was laid down by regulations issued in 1936 – 37 , which introduced a requirement to raise a third cavalry division for war service . The strength of a cavalry division was 6 @,@ 000 – 7 @,@ 000 men . The theoretical war establishment of a fully mobilised Yugoslav cavalry division was : 
 headquarters and headquarters company 
 a cavalry brigade consisting of 2 or 3 cavalry regiments 
 an artillery battalion of four batteries , one of which was motorised and equipped with 47 mm anti @-@ tank guns 
 a bicycle @-@ mounted infantry battalion with three rifle companies and one machine gun company 
 a signals squadron 
 a bridging squadron equipped with pontoons 
 a chemical platoon 
 a divisional cavalry battalion consisting of two cavalry squadrons , a machine gun squadron , an engineer squadron and a bicycle company 
 logistics units 
 Each cavalry regiment was to consist of four cavalry squadrons , a machine gun squadron , and an engineer squadron . Shortly before the war , an abortive attempt was made to <unk> the 1st Cavalry Division , but this was stymied by a lack of motor transport and the division largely remained a horsed formation throughout its existence . The 1st Cavalry Division was also never equipped with the planned motorised anti @-@ tank battery , and the divisional artillery battalion was largely equipped with World War I @-@ vintage pieces . Two peacetime components of the division , the 2nd Cavalry Brigade and 3rd Cavalry Regiment , were earmarked to join other formations when they were mobilised , so the primary fighting formation of the 1st Cavalry Division was the 1st Cavalry Brigade , commanding the 2nd , 6th and 8th Cavalry Regiments . 
 = = Planned deployment = = 
 In case of war , Yugoslav planners saw the 1st Cavalry Division forming the bulk of the reserve for the 1st Army Group . The 1st Army Group was responsible for the defence of northwestern Yugoslavia , with the 4th Army defending the western sector along the Hungarian border , and the 7th Army along the Reich and Italian borders . The 1st Cavalry Division was to be held as the 1st Army Group reserve around Zagreb . On the left of the 4th Army , the boundary with the 7th Army ran from Radgon on the Mura through Krapina and Karlovac to Otočac . On the right of the 4th Army was the 2nd Army of the 2nd Army Group , with the boundary running from just east of Slatina through Požega towards Banja Luka . The Yugoslav defence plan saw both armies deployed in a cordon , the 4th Army behind the Drava river between Varaždin and Slatina , and the 7th Army along the border region from the Adriatic in the west to Radgon in the east . It was envisaged that this reserve would be located in and around Zagreb . The planners estimated that cavalry formations would take 4 – 7 days to mobilise . 
 = = Operations = = 
 = = = Mobilisation = = = 
 A general mobilisation was not called until 3 April 1941 , out of fear of offending Adolf Hitler . By the time the invasion commenced , the 1st Cavalry Division had only begun mobilisation . According to the Yugoslav historian Velimir Terzić , on 6 April the mobilisation of the division was proceeding slowly due to the low number of conscripts that reported for duty , and the poor provision of animals and vehicles . A large portion of the strength of the division had been earmarked to be detached to one of the formations of the 4th Army , Detachment Ormozki . 
 The commander of the 1st Cavalry Division was <unk> General Dragoslav Stefanović . While the divisional headquarters and other divisional @-@ level units were mobilising in Sesvete near Zagreb , the headquarters of the 1st Cavalry Brigade had been designated to command Detachment Ormozki , and the 6th and 8th Cavalry Regiments and the divisional artillery battalion had also been allocated to that formation . This reduced the main fighting elements of the division to a single cavalry regiment ( the 2nd ) , which was mobilising in Virovitica . The rest of the 1st Army Group reserve comprised an independent artillery battalion mobilising in Zagreb , and the 110th Infantry Regiment which was moving to Zagreb from Celje , a distance of 114 kilometres ( 71 mi ) to the northwest . By early morning of 6 April 1941 when the invasion commenced , the 110th Regiment had reached Zidani Most , still some 90 kilometres ( 56 mi ) from Zagreb . 
 = = = Deployment = = = 
 Stripped of most of its subordinate units , the 1st Cavalry Division remained in reserve near Zagreb during the first few days of fighting . On 10 April , due to the critical situation on the front of the 4th Army , the division was directed to take under its command the 110th Infantry Regiment and the independent artillery battalion , and defend against crossings of the 110 @-@ kilometre ( 68 mi ) stretch of the river Sava between Jasenovac and Zagreb , while collecting stragglers and organising resistance . These orders were quickly overtaken by the rapid advance of the 14th Panzer Division to Zagreb when it broke out of its bridgehead across the Drava river at Gyékényes on the Hungarian border . By 19 : 30 on 10 April , lead elements of the 14th Panzer Division had reached the outskirts of Zagreb , having covered nearly 160 km ( 99 mi ) in a single day . Armed fifth column <unk> groups and German troops disarmed the division and its attached units before they could establish any coherent defence along the Sava .

 = Warrior @-@ class ironclad = 
 The Warrior @-@ class ironclads were a class of two warships built for the Royal Navy between 1859 and 1862 , the first ocean @-@ going ironclads with iron hulls ever constructed . The ships were designed as armoured frigates in response to an invasion scare sparked by the launch of the French ironclad Gloire and her three sisters in 1858 . They were initially armed with a mix of rifled breech @-@ loading and muzzle @-@ loading smoothbore guns , but the Armstrong breech @-@ loading guns proved unreliable and were ultimately withdrawn from service . 
 The ships spent their first commission with the Channel Fleet before being rearmed with new rifled muzzle @-@ loading guns in the late 1860s . Warrior rejoined the Channel Fleet after her refit while Black Prince joined the 1st Class Reserve and joined the fleet during its annual manoeuvres . The two ships exchanged roles after another refit in the mid @-@ 1870s . Both ships spent most of the last two decades of the 19th century in reserve . Warrior was hulked in 1902 and survived to be restored in 1979 as a museum ship . Black Prince became a training ship in 1896 and was hulked in 1910 before being sold for scrap in 1923 . 
 = = Design and description = = 
 The Warrior @-@ class ships have been described as revolutionary , but in truth they were more evolutionary than not as everything except their wrought iron armour had been in use by ocean @-@ going ships for years . The naval architect and historian David K. Brown commented , " What made [ Warrior ] truly novel was the way in which these individual aspects were blended together , making her the biggest and most powerful warship in the world . " They were designed in response to Gloire , which started an invasion scare in Britain , but they had a very different concept of operation to the French ship which was meant as a replacement for wooden ships of the line . They were designed by Chief Constructor of the Navy Isaac Watts as 40 @-@ gun armoured frigates largely based on the fine lines of the large frigate Mersey . Warrior and her sister Black Prince were not intended to stand in the line of battle as the Admiralty was uncertain about their ability to withstand concentrated fire from wooden two and three @-@ deck ships of the line . Rather they were designed to be fast enough to force battle on a fleeing enemy and to control the range at which a battle was fought for their own advantage . 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 The Warrior @-@ class ships were 380 feet 2 inches ( 115 @.@ 9 m ) long between perpendiculars and 420 feet ( 128 @.@ 0 m ) long overall . This was 44 feet ( 13 @.@ 4 m ) longer than the Mersey , the longest wooden @-@ hulled ship in the Royal Navy . They had a beam of 58 feet 4 inches ( 17 @.@ 8 m ) and a draught of 26 feet 10 inches ( 8 @.@ 2 m ) . The ships displaced 9 @,@ 137 long tons ( 9 @,@ 284 t ) . The hull was subdivided by watertight transverse bulkheads into 92 compartments and had a double bottom underneath the engine and boiler rooms . 
 Two bilge keels were fitted ( the first used by the Royal Navy ) , which significantly reduced the roll of the ships . Because of their length the ships proved to be very sluggish while manoeuvring , as Warrior proved when she collided with Royal Oak in 1868 . The Warrior @-@ class ships trimmed down by the bow , not least because they were fitted with a 40 @-@ long @-@ ton ( 41 t ) iron knee placed at the bow to give it a traditionally pleasing shape . This also prevented the ships from ramming any other ships . The bowsprit was shortened after completion in an effort to reduce the trim , but it was not noticeably successful . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 The Warrior @-@ class ships had one 2 @-@ cylinder trunk steam engine made by John Penn and Sons driving a single 24 @-@ foot @-@ 6 @-@ inch ( 7 @.@ 5 m ) propeller . Ten rectangular boilers provided steam to the engine at a working pressure of 20 psi ( 138 kPa ; 1 kgf / cm2 ) . The engine produced a total of 5 @,@ 267 indicated horsepower ( 3 @,@ 928 kW ) and was the most powerful thus far built for a warship . On sea trials in October 1861 Warrior had a maximum speed around 14 @.@ 3 knots ( 26 @.@ 5 km / h ; 16 @.@ 5 mph ) ; Black Prince was about a half knot slower . The ships carried 800 long tons ( 810 t ) of coal , enough to steam 2 @,@ 100 nautical miles ( 3 @,@ 900 km ; 2 @,@ 400 mi ) at 11 knots ( 20 km / h ; 13 mph ) . 
 The ironclads were ship rigged and had a sail area of 48 @,@ 400 square feet ( 4 @,@ 497 m2 ) . The lower masts were made of wood , but the other masts were iron . Warrior made 13 knots ( 24 km / h ; 15 mph ) under sail , but Black Prince could only do 11 knots ( 20 km / h ; 13 mph ) . Under both sail and steam Warrior once logged 17 @.@ 5 knots ( 32 @.@ 4 km / h ; 20 @.@ 1 mph ) . Both funnels were semi @-@ retractable to reduce wind resistance while under sail alone . The ships ' propellers could be hoisted up into the stern of the ship to reduce drag while under sail . They were the largest <unk> propellers ever made and required about 600 men to be raised . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The armament of the Warrior @-@ class ships was intended to be 40 smoothbore , muzzle @-@ loading 68 @-@ pounder guns , 19 on each side on the main deck and one each fore and aft as chase guns on the upper deck . This was modified during construction to ten rifled 110 @-@ pounder breech @-@ loading guns , 26 × 68 @-@ pounders , and four rifled breech @-@ loading 40 @-@ pounder guns as saluting guns . The 40 @-@ pounder guns were to have been replaced by 70 @-@ pounder guns , but these failed their tests and were never issued . Both breech @-@ loading guns were new designs from Armstrong and much was hoped for them . Four of the 110 @-@ pounder guns were installed on the main deck amidships and the other two became chase guns ; all of the 68 @-@ pounder guns were mounted on the main deck . Firing tests carried out in September 1861 against an armoured target , however , proved that the 110 @-@ pounder was inferior to the 68 @-@ pounder smoothbore gun in armour penetration and repeated incidents of breech explosions during the Battles for Shimonoseki and the Bombardment of Kagoshima in 1863 – 64 forestalled plans to completely equip the ships with the 110 @-@ pounder gun . 
 The 7 @.@ 9 @-@ inch ( 201 mm ) solid shot of the 68 @-@ pounder gun weighed approximately 68 pounds ( 30 @.@ 8 kg ) while the gun itself weighed 10 @,@ 640 pounds ( 4 @,@ 826 @.@ 2 kg ) . The gun had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 579 ft / s ( 481 m / s ) and had a range of 3 @,@ 200 yards ( 2 @,@ 900 m ) at an elevation of 12 ° . The 7 @-@ inch ( 178 mm ) shell of the 110 @-@ pounder Armstrong breech @-@ loader weighed 107 – 110 pounds ( 48 @.@ 5 – 49 @.@ 9 kg ) . It had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 150 ft / s ( 350 m / s ) and , at an elevation of 11 @.@ 25 ° , a maximum range of 4 @,@ 000 yards ( 3 @,@ 700 m ) . The shell of the 40 @-@ pounder breech @-@ loading gun was 4 @.@ 75 inches ( 121 mm ) in diameter and weighed 40 pounds ( 18 @.@ 1 kg ) . The gun had a maximum range of 3 @,@ 800 yards ( 3 @,@ 500 m ) at a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 150 ft / s ( 350 m / s ) . The 110 @-@ pounder gun weighed 9 @,@ 520 pounds ( 4 @,@ 318 @.@ 2 kg ) while the 40 @-@ pounder weighed 3 @,@ 584 pounds ( 1 @,@ 625 @.@ 7 kg ) . In 1863 – 64 the 40 @-@ pounder guns were replaced by a heavier version with the same ballistics . All of the guns could fire both solid shot and explosive shells . 
 Both ships were rearmed during their 1867 – 68 refit with a mix of 7 @-@ inch and 8 @-@ inch ( 203 mm ) rifled muzzle @-@ loading guns . Warrior received twenty @-@ eight 7 @-@ inch and four 8 @-@ inch guns while Black Prince received four fewer 7 @-@ inch guns . Both ships received four 20 @-@ pounder breech @-@ loading guns for use as saluting guns . The shell of the 15 @-@ calibre 8 @-@ inch gun weighed 175 pounds ( 79 @.@ 4 kg ) while the gun itself weighed 9 long tons ( 9 @.@ 1 t ) . It had a muzzle velocity of 1 @,@ 410 ft / s ( 430 m / s ) and was credited with the ability to penetrate a nominal 9 @.@ 6 inches ( 244 mm ) of wrought iron armour at the muzzle . The 16 @-@ calibre 7 @-@ inch gun weighed 6 @.@ 5 long tons ( 6 @.@ 6 t ) and fired a 112 @-@ pound ( 50 @.@ 8 kg ) shell . It was credited with the nominal ability to penetrate 7 @.@ 7 @-@ inch ( 196 mm ) armour . 
 = = = Armour = = = 
 The Warrior @-@ class ships had a wrought iron armour belt , 4 @.@ 5 inches ( 114 mm ) thick , that covered 213 feet ( 64 @.@ 9 m ) amidships . The armour extended 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) above the waterline and 6 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 m ) below it . 4 @.@ 5 @-@ inch transverse bulkheads protected the guns on the main deck . The armour was backed by 16 inches ( 410 mm ) of teak . The ends of the ship were left entirely unprotected which meant that the steering gear was very vulnerable . 
 = = Construction = = 
 The gun ports of the Warrior @-@ class ships were built 46 inches ( 1 @.@ 2 m ) wide , which allowed the 68 @-@ pounders to traverse 52 ° . While the ships were building the directing bar was developed which consisted of an iron bar that fastened to a pivot bolt in the sill of the gun port . After the gun carriages were modified , this allowed them to pivot much closer to the gun port than had previously been possible and meant that the gun ports could be narrowed to a width of 24 inches ( 0 @.@ 6 m ) while retaining the same arc of fire . The gun ports were narrowed to the new width by 7 inches ( 178 mm ) of wrought iron . Another delay was the modification of the armour plates with tongue and groove joints to lock the plates together and increase their resistance to armour @-@ piercing shells . All together these modifications delayed the completion of Warrior by a year past her contract completion date . 
 = = Service = = 
 HMS Warrior joined the Channel Fleet in July 1862 and was placed in ordinary from 1864 to 1867 , during which time she was refitted . The ship rejoined the Channel Fleet in 1867 and towed a floating drydock to Bermuda in 1869 with her sister Black Prince . Warrior was placed in ordinary again from 1872 to 1875 and was modified with a poop deck . She was recommissioned into the 1st Class Reserve in 1875 and made periodic training cruises until 1883 . The ship was formally reclassified as an armoured frigate in 1884 , but was disarmed and mastless . Warrior was hulked as a depot ship in Portsmouth Harbor in 1902 and renamed Vernon III in 1904 when she became part of HMS Vernon , the Royal Navy 's Torpedo School . The ship regained her original name in 1923 and was converted once more into an oil pipeline pier in 1927 . Warrior was towed to Pembroke Dock in 1929 and was renamed C77 in 1942 to release her name for the new aircraft carrier HMS Warrior . In 1979 C77 was moved to Hartlepool and was restored as HMS Warrior ( 1860 ) as the Fleet Headquarters in Northwood , London had assumed the name of HMS Warrior in the early 1960s . The ironclad can now be seen near HMS Victory at Portsmouth Historic Dockyard . 
 Black Prince capsized while in dock at Greenock , damaging her masts . She arrived in Spithead in November 1861 with only jury @-@ rigged fore and mizzenmasts . The ship was assigned to the Channel Fleet upon her completion and in 1867 – 68 she was rearmed and then assigned to the 1st Class Reserve . She was refitted in 1874 and given a poop deck , and rejoined the Channel Fleet in 1875 as the flagship of Rear Admiral Sir John Dalrymple @-@ Hay , second in command of the fleet . Black Prince was placed in reserve in 1878 in Devonport until she was converted to a training ship in 1896 in Queenstown , Ireland and renamed Emerald in 1903 . The ship was hulked and renamed Impregnable III in 1910 when she was assigned to the training school HMS Impregnable before she was sold for scrap on 21 March 1923 . 
 = Stamata Revithi = 
 Stamata Revithi ( Greek : <unk> <unk> ; 1866 – after 1896 ) was a Greek woman who ran the 40 @-@ kilometre marathon during the 1896 Summer Olympics . The Games excluded women from competition , but Revithi insisted that she be allowed to run . Revithi ran one day after the men had completed the official race , and although she finished the marathon in approximately 5 hours and 30 minutes and found witnesses to sign their names and verify the running time , she was not allowed to enter the Panathinaiko Stadium at the end of the race . She intended to present her documentation to the Hellenic Olympic Committee in the hopes that they would recognize her achievement , but it is not known whether she did so . No known record survives of Revithi 's life after her run . 
 According to contemporary sources , a second woman , " Melpomene " , also ran the 1896 marathon race . There is debate among Olympic historians as to whether or not Revithi and Melpomene are the same person . 
 = = Biographical elements = = 
 = = = Before the 1896 Olympics = = = 
 Stamata Revithi was born in Syros in 1866 . Records of her life from 1896 show that she was living in poverty in Piraeus in 1896 . At that point she had given birth to two children , a son who died in 1895 , aged seven , and another child who was seventeen months old by the time of the 1896 Olympics . According to Olympic historian Athanasios Tarasouleas , Revithi , who was blonde and thin with large eyes , looked much older than her age . 
 Revithi believed that she could gain employment in Athens , and so walked there from her home — a distance of 9 kilometers ( 5 @.@ 6 mi ) . Her journey took place several days prior to the Olympic marathon , a special race of 40 kilometers ( 25 mi ) invented as part of the athletics program , and based on Michel Bréal 's idea of a race from the city of Marathon to the <unk> . Bréal took inspiration from Pheidippides , who , according to legend , ran the distance from Marathon to Athens to announce the Greek victory over Persia at the Battle of Marathon , and died immediately after giving his message . 
 En route to Athens , Revithi encountered a male runner along the road . He gave her money and advised her to run the marathon to become famous , and , consequently , earn money or more easily find a job . After this discussion Revithi decided to run the race : she had enjoyed long @-@ distance running as a child , and believed she could beat the male competitors . 
 The 1896 Olympic Games were the first held in the Modern era and the most important international multi @-@ sport event Greece had ever hosted . The rules of the Games generally excluded women from competition . Influenced by both his times — in the Victorian era women were considered to be inferior to men — and his admiration for the ancient Olympic Games , when only men were allowed to participate in the events , Baron Pierre de Coubertin , the visionary of the modern Olympic Games , was not in favour of women 's participation in the Olympic Games or in sports generally . He believed that a woman 's greatest achievement would be to encourage her sons to be distinguished in sports and to applaud a man 's effort .

 Revithi arrived at the race location , the small village of Marathon , on Thursday , 9 April [ O.S. 28 March ] , where the athletes had already assembled for the following day 's race . She attracted the attention of the reporters and was warmly greeted by Marathon 's mayor , who sheltered her in his house . She answered the reporters ' questions and was quick @-@ witted when a male runner from <unk> teased her , predicting that when she entered the Stadium , there would be no crowds left . Revithi retorted that he should not insult women , since male Greek athletes had already been humiliated by the Americans . 
 Prior to the start of the race on the morning of Friday , 10 April [ O.S. 29 March ] , the old priest of Marathon , Ioannis <unk> , was scheduled to say a prayer for the athletes in the church of Saint John . <unk> refused to bless Revithi because she was not an officially recognized athlete . The organizing committee ultimately refused her entry into the race . Officially , she was rejected because the deadline for participation had expired ; however , as Olympic historians David Martin and Roger <unk> point out , the real problem was her gender . According to Tarasouleas , the organizers promised that she would compete with a team of American women in another race in Athens , which never took place . 
 Beginning at 8 : 00 the following day , Revithi ran the marathon course on her own . Before starting , she had the town 's only teacher , the mayor , and the city magistrate sign a statement testifying to the time she departed from the village . She ran the race at a steady pace and reached <unk> ( the place where the <unk> Hospital stands today , near the Hilton Athens ) at 13 : 30 ( 5 ½ hours ) . Revithi was not allowed to enter Panathinaiko Stadium — her race was stopped in <unk> by a few Greek military officers whom she asked to sign her handwritten report to certify her time of arrival in Athens . She stated to the reporters that she wanted to meet Timoleon <unk> ( the General @-@ Secretary of the Hellenic Olympic Committee ) to present her case . Historians believe that she intended to present her documents to the Hellenic Olympic Committee in the hopes that they would recognize her achievement . Neither her reports nor documents from the Hellenic Olympic Committee have been discovered to provide corroboration . 
 = = = Aftermath = = = 
 There is no account of Revithi 's life following the marathon . Although some newspapers printed articles about her story in the build @-@ up to the marathon , these reports did not follow up on her life after the race . It is not known whether she met <unk> or if she ever found a job . As Tarasouleas stated , " Stamata Revithi was lost in the dust of history " . Violet Piercy , of the United Kingdom , was the first woman to complete an officially timed marathon race : she clocked a time of 3 hours and 40 minutes in a British race on 3 October 1926 . Women were finally allowed to run the Olympic marathon at the 1984 Summer Olympics , when American Joan Benoit won the inaugural race in a time of 2 hours and 24 minutes . 
 = = Melpomene = = 
 In March 1896 , a French @-@ language newspaper in Athens ( the Messager d <unk> ) reported that there was " talk of a woman who had enrolled as a participant in the Marathon race . In the test run which she completed on her own [ ... ] she took 4 ½ hours to run the distance of 42 [ sic ] kilometres which separates Marathon from Athens . " Later that year , Franz <unk> , a founding International Olympic Committee member from Hungary , wrote in German that , " indeed a lady , Miss Melpomene , completed the 40 kilometres marathon in 4 ½ hours and requested an entry into the Olympic Games competition . This was reportedly denied by the commission . " According to Martin and <unk> , " a peculiarity here is why there is no first name for Melpomene " . The Messager report faded into obscurity for about 30 years before it was revived in 1927 in an issue of Der <unk> . 
 Olympic historian Karl Lennartz contends that two women ran the marathon in 1896 , and that the name " Melpomene " was confirmed by both <unk> and Alfréd Hajós , two @-@ time Olympic swim champion of 1896 . Lennartz presents the following account : a young woman named Melpomene wanted to run the race and completed the distance in 4 ½ hours at the end of February or the beginning of March . The organizing committee , however , did not allow her to run , and the newspaper <unk> criticized the committee for its decision . The Olympic Marathon took place on 10 April [ O.S. 29 March ] 1896 , and another female runner , Stamata Revithi , took 5 ½ hours to run the course on 11 April [ O.S. 30 March ] 1896 . The newspapers Asti , New Aristophanes and Atlantida reported this on 12 April [ O.S. 31 March ] 1896 . 
 However , Tarasouleas argues that no contemporary press reports in Greek newspapers mention Melpomene by name , while the name Revithi appears many times ; Tarasouleas suggests that Melpomene and Revithi are the same person , and Martin and Green argue that " a contemporary account referring to Revithi as a well @-@ known marathon runner could explain the earlier run by a woman over the marathon course — this was by Revithi herself , not Melpomene " . The daily Athens newspaper Estia of 4 April [ O.S. 23 March ] 1896 refers to " the strange woman , who , having run a few days ago in the Marathon as a try @-@ out , intends to compete the day after tomorrow . Today she came to our offices and said ' should my shoes hinder me , I will remove them on the way and continue barefoot ' . " Moreover , Tarasouleas notes that on 13 March [ O.S. 1 March ] 1896 , another local newspaper indicated that a woman and her baby had registered to run the marathon , but again her name is not mentioned . Trying to resolve the mystery , Tarasouleas asserts that " perhaps Revithi had two names , or perhaps for reasons unknown she was attributed the name of the Muse Melpomene " .

 Hurricane Cleo was the third named storm , first hurricane , and first major hurricane of the 1964 Atlantic hurricane season . Cleo was one of the longest @-@ lived storms of the season . This compact yet powerful hurricane travelled through the Caribbean Sea and later hit Florida before moving offshore Georgia into the Carolinas , killing 156 people and causing roughly $ 187 million in damage . Major damage was seen as far north as east @-@ central Florida , with the heaviest rains falling along the immediate coast of the Southeast United States into southeast Virginia .

 A tropical wave that exited the coast of Africa on August 15 , 1964 , moved westward , not organizing into a tropical depression until around 890 miles ( 1432 @.@ 3 km ) east of Barbados on August 20 – as reported by a Navy reconnaissance plane . It continued west @-@ northwestward , quickly strengthening to a hurricane the next day with a minimum central pressure of 993 mb . Early in the afternoon of August 22 , Cleo crossed Guadeloupe as a 115 mph ( 185 km / h ) Category 3 hurricane . The hurricane continued to strengthen as it moved through the Caribbean Sea and reached its peak intensity of 155 mph ( 250 km / h ) on the August 23 while south of the Dominican Republic . It maintained that intensity for a day , bringing heavy rain and winds to Hispaniola . As Cleo passed south of Haiti on August 24 , it veered northward momentarily , enough to move on to the Southwest Peninsula of Haiti . The circulation of the hurricane was greatly disrupted by the mountainous terrain of the island , quickly weakening the hurricane . 
 Cleo weakened to a Category 1 hurricane before hitting southern Cuba on the August 26 . It crossed the island quickly . Shortly after emerging from the north coast of Cuba , Cleo restrengthened to a hurricane , having weakened to a tropical storm while over Cuba . Cleo managed to intensify to a 100 mph ( 160 km / h ) , Category 2 hurricane before hitting the Miami , Florida area on August 27 . It weakened to a tropical storm while over Florida on the 28th . The center moved offshore between Jacksonville and St. Augustine , Florida , before moving back onshore near Savannah , Georgia on August 29 without any increase in intensity . Its northward path along the Florida coast was unusual for the month of August . 
 Cleo continued to weaken as it moved through the Carolinas , drifting through as a tropical depression . After bringing heavy rain through the area , Cleo exited into the Atlantic Ocean near Norfolk , Virginia , and quickly intensified to a tropical storm again on the September 1 . The following day , Cleo became a hurricane again , but it remained well offshore and did not cause any further damage . Cleo was last noted on September 5 northeast of Newfoundland .

 The hurricane was the first to directly strike Miami since Hurricane King in the 1950 season . Cleo intensified rapidly just prior to landfall , bringing sustained winds of 100 – 105 mph ( 160 km / h – 170 km / h ) with gusts to 135 mph ( 215 km / h ) to the Miami area , due to moving over water temperatures of 30 to 32 degrees Celsius and its compact size . Lightning was observed within the eyewall at the National Hurricane Center . The pressure fell to 967 @.@ 6 mb ( 28 @.@ 57 inches ) in North Miami . Major damage was constrained to a 20 – 35 mile ( 30 km – 50 km ) wide strip from Miami to Melbourne , in the form of broken glass , interior flooding , uprooted trees , overturned aircraft , power failures , and agriculture . Cleo cut power to 620 @,@ 000 homes and businesses in southeast Florida . In Miami Shores the <unk> was out for five days . At least two dozen fires blazed across Miami .

This helped lead to double the average rainfall for the month of September for southeast Virginia . Seven tornadoes were reported within South Carolina , while North Carolina witnessed three tornado touchdowns .

Virginia Beach , Virginia fought to build a drainage canal to help drain the Lynnhaven flood zone after Cleo 's flooding rains struck the region . Over the objection of those in North Carolina , the canal was built .

The programme examined the deaths of three Provisional Irish Republican Army ( IRA ) members in Gibraltar on 6 March 1988 at the hands of the British Special Air Service ( codenamed " Operation Flavius " ) . " Death on the Rock " presented evidence that the IRA members were shot without warning or while attempting to surrender . It was condemned by the British government , while tabloid newspapers denounced it as sensationalist . " Death on the Rock " subsequently became the first individual documentary to be the subject of an independent inquiry , in which it was largely vindicated . 
 The project began after it emerged that the three IRA members shot in Gibraltar were found to be unarmed and not in possession of a bomb . The series ' editor , Roger Bolton , dispatched journalists to Gibraltar and Spain , where they interviewed several people who witnessed the shootings as well as Spanish police officers who had been involved in surveillance of the IRA team . The journalists also filmed the funerals of the IRA members in Belfast . Satisfied by the journalists ' findings , Bolton sought a conclusion to the programme ; as the British government refused to comment , Bolton recruited a leading human rights lawyer to give his opinion on the findings . The documentary was broadcast on 28 April 1988 ( just under two months after the shootings ) , despite two attempts by Sir Geoffrey Howe , the foreign secretary , to have the Independent Broadcasting Authority postpone the broadcast . Using the eyewitness statements , the documentary questioned the government 's version of events , and suggested that the three IRA members may have been unlawfully killed . Reporter Julian Manyon summed up the programme 's findings : none of the witnesses interviewed for the programme heard the soldiers challenge the trio before opening fire , but variously believed they had seen the IRA members shot in the back , with their hands up , or shot after falling to the ground . The final contributor was the lawyer recruited by Bolton , who suggested that a judicial inquiry was necessary to resolve the conflicts . 
 The morning after the broadcast , several tabloid newspapers attacked the documentary , accusing it of sensationalism and " trial by television " . In the following days , they mounted a campaign against Carmen Proetta , one of the documentary 's main witnesses , accusing her of being a former prostitute and of being anti @-@ British ; Proetta later successfully sued several newspapers for libel . Other newspapers accused " Death on the Rock " of misrepresenting the eyewitnesses ' statements and criticised the IBA for allowing the documentary to be broadcast . The eyewitnesses interviewed for " Death on the Rock " gave evidence at the inquest into the shootings ; most repeated the statements they had given the programme , but one witness — who had told the programme he had seen a soldier stand over one of the IRA members and fire at the man while he was on the ground — retracted his previous statement . As a result of the retraction , Thames commissioned an independent inquiry into the making of " Death on the Rock " — the first time an inquiry had been commissioned into the making of an individual documentary . The Windlesham – Rampton report found that the programme 's tendency was to present evidence that the IRA members had been unlawfully killed , but that it sought to raise questions rather than to reach a conclusion . The authors made several criticisms of the documentary , but overall found it a " trenchant " work of journalism , made in " good faith and without ulterior motives " . Thames lost its franchise and the IBA was abolished as a result of the Broadcasting Act 1990 — decisions which several involved parties believed were influenced by the government 's anger at " Death on the Rock " .

 This Week was a current affairs television series which began in 1956 . In 1978 , it was renamed TV Eye and took on a light entertainment format ; the title This Week was restored in 1986 , after which it became steadily more journalistic . The programme was broadcast simultaneously across the ITV regions and became a mainstay of ITV 's current affairs programming . By 1988 , the programme had interviewed several prime ministers and leaders of the opposition , including Margaret Thatcher ( the incumbent prime minister ) , who had been interviewed for three full episodes . 
 = = = Gibraltar shootings = = = 
 On 6 March 1988 , three members of an IRA Active Service Unit — Daniel McCann , Mairead Farrell , and Sean Savage — were witnessed parking a car in a car park in Gibraltar ; the car park was used as an assembly area for British soldiers preparing for the weekly " changing of the guard " ceremony outside the Convent ( the residence of the governor of Gibraltar ) . The three were suspected by the British authorities of being part of a plot to detonate a car bomb in the car park while it was full of soldiers preparing for the ceremony ; while the suspects were walking back towards the Spanish border , they were shot dead by British soldiers , members of the Special Air Service . In the immediate aftermath of the shootings , the British government released a statement to the effect that a large car bomb had been found in Gibraltar , and that three suspected terrorists had been shot dead by the Gibraltar Police . That evening , British television news reported the finding of the alleged car bomb , and added that the IRA members had been involved in a " shootout " with authorities . All of Britain 's daily newspapers covered the shootings the following morning , several of which cited the size of the alleged car bomb as 500 pounds ( 230 kg ) and claimed that it was " packed with shrapnel " . The same morning , Ian Stewart , Minister of State for the Armed Forces , told BBC Radio 4 that " military personnel were involved " in the shootings , and that " a car bomb was found , which has been defused " . 
 The following day , however , Sir Geoffrey Howe , the British foreign secretary , made a statement to the House of Commons regarding the shootings , in which he informed the house that the IRA members were unarmed , and that the car parked in the assembly area did not contain an explosive device . Howe stated that the IRA members " made movements which led the military personnel , operating in support of the Gibraltar Police , to conclude that their own lives and the lives of others were under threat " . " In light of this response " , Howe continued , " they were shot " by " military personnel , operating in support of the Gibraltar Police " . Subsequent inquiries led to the discovery of a large quantity of explosives in Marbella ( 50 miles ( 80 km ) from Gibraltar ) , along with detonators and timers .

 This Week 's editor , Roger Bolton initially believed there was little merit in investigating the shootings . Based on the official account of events that was presented in the immediate aftermath of the shootings , Bolton believed that most people would think the IRA members " deserved what they got " . Bolton 's interest , however , was piqued by Sir Geoffrey Howe 's statement , and the revelation in it that the deceased were unarmed and were not in possession of a bomb . Shortly afterwards , he dispatched two of This Week 's journalists , Julian Manyon and Chris Oxley , to Gibraltar and Spain ( respectively ) to gather more information on the shootings . Bolton believed that the Milltown Cemetery attack and the corporals killings , two events in Belfast which resulted from the Gibraltar killings , provided " even more compelling reasons " to investigate the shootings ; the team considered switching the focus of the programme to the effects the shootings had in Belfast , but decided to continue with the original project . 
 = = = Gibraltar = = = 
 After ten days ' investigation , Oxley was surprised to learn that the Gibraltar Police were handling the police investigation into the shootings , having been closely involved in the events leading up to them . He also grew concerned that the police investigation was insufficiently rigorous when he learned that the police had not taken statements from residents whose flats overlooked the scene of Farrell 's and McCann 's deaths . The Gibraltar coroner , Felix Pizzarello , welcomed This Week 's investigation , telling Oxley that he hoped the journalists would uncover witnesses who could assist the inquest . While Oxley was investigating the shootings from Gibraltar , Manyon travelled to Madrid in an attempt to learn more about the surveillance operation which took place in Spain prior to the shootings . Bolton added Alison Cahn to the team on 18 March ; her task was to visit the flats which overlooked the petrol station where McCann and Farrell were shot , with the aim of interviewing any residents who might have witnessed the events of 6 March . After several days ' work , the team found two eyewitnesses to the shootings who were willing to speak on camera : Stephen Bullock , a local lawyer who had witnessed the events while out for a walk with his wife ; and Josie Celecia , a housewife who had seen the shooting of McCann and Savage from her apartment window . Both witnesses ' statements appeared to the journalists to be inconsistent with the official account of the shootings . 
 The journalists quickly decided they needed expert advice on ballistics and explosives , to which end they engaged Lieutenant Colonel George Styles , GC , a retired British Army officer who had served as a bomb @-@ disposal officer in Northern Ireland during the Troubles . Styles arrived in Gibraltar on 23 March , and immediately went to inspect the car park where Savage had parked the white Renault on the day of the shootings , after which he walked through the town along what the journalists believed was the IRA members ' most likely route . When asked his opinion by the journalists , Styles cast doubt on the authorities ' stated reasons for the shootings . He explained to the journalists that — had Savage 's white Renault contained a substantial bomb — the weight would have been evident on the vehicle 's springs . Styles also felt that the potential bomb was unlikely to have been detonated with a remote detonator on account of the buildings between the scenes of the shootings and the likelihood that it would be drowned out by other radio signals in the area . Finally , the journalists asked Styles to examine the scenes of the shootings , including ricochet marks that the soldiers ' bullets had left on the pumps at the petrol station where McCann and Farrell were shot . 
 As Styles was examining the ricochet marks , Alison Cahn was approached by an elderly woman , who led Cahn to a nearby apartment building . There , the woman introduced Cahn to her daughter — Carmen Proetta — who told Cahn that she had witnessed the shooting at the petrol station ; although initially reluctant , she was persuaded by Cahn to give her account of the events in an affidavit . Proetta asserted that , immediately before McCann and Farrell were shot , she saw a police car travelling north on Winston Churchill Avenue with its siren activated ; as she watched , the police car stopped abruptly and four men — one uniformed police officer and three men in civilian clothes — jumped out . She stated that the three men in plain clothes , all carrying pistols , leapt across the central reservation barrier , at which point she saw McCann and Farrell raise their hands . Proetta believed that all three men then opened fire , while McCann and Farrell had their hands in the air , and that neither suspect made any movements towards their clothing or Farrell 's handbag . She went on to state that she witnessed one of the men crouch over McCann and Farrell while they were on the ground , and continue to shoot them . According to Styles , Proetta 's account of the shooting tallied with the bullet marks he examined at the petrol station ; he also found her description of the bullets striking the bodies particularly convincing , believing that only somebody who had witnessed such an event would be able to describe it so vividly . The journalists also discovered that Proetta 's account of the soldiers arriving in a police car matched some of the newspaper reports from the day after the shootings . 
 By the end of March , Cahn had traced two further witnesses to the shootings — Diana Treacy , who claimed to have seen the soldiers shooting Savage in the back without warning and continuing to shoot him while he was on the ground , and Kenneth Asquez , who had provided a hand @-@ written , unsigned statement , but was extremely reluctant to be filmed or named as a witness . He had come to the attention of the journalists through another witness , who provided Cahn with a video recording of the aftermath of the shootings . The journalists approached the witness through a second intermediary — Christopher Finch , a local lawyer who had been assisting them as a consultant — and received a typed but unsigned affidavit . In both documents , Asquez stated that he had been a passenger in a car that was passing the scene of Savage 's shooting on 6 March ; he described seeing Savage lying on the ground with a soldier standing over him , and witnessing the soldier shoot Savage " two or three times at point @-@ blank range " while the latter was on the ground . The journalists failed to persuade Asquez to sign his affidavit , but decided to incorporate it into the programme nonetheless .

 Julian Manyon arrived in Madrid on 11 March , and shortly afterwards engaged Henry <unk> , a journalist and American expatriate , as an interpreter and consultant for the programme . Within days , the two men wrote to the Spanish police headquarters to request information from the authorities and assistance in reconstructing the surveillance operation that preceded the shootings as the IRA team travelled through Spain . Ten days later , they met with a spokesman for the Spanish interior ministry , who confirmed that the Spanish authorities had tracked the three IRA members throughout their time in Spain . The Spanish surveillance operation included multiple cars following the suspects ' vehicle , periodically " leap @-@ frogging " each other to avoid attracting attention ; use of a helicopter to track the team 's movements ; constant radio communication between the officers involved and police headquarters ; and officers monitoring the suspects ' movements at fixed observations posts . The spokesman also told the men that the Spanish kept the British authorities constantly apprised of the IRA team 's movements , and that the British were aware of Savage 's arrival at the Gibraltar border , and allowed the white Renault he was driving to enter the territory .

 As well as the investigation in Gibraltar and Spain , This Week conducted some of the filming for " Death on the Rock " in Northern Ireland . Its journalists filmed the funeral of McCann , Savage , and Farrell ; while there , Manyon took the opportunity to interview Gerry Adams , leader of Sinn Féin , who refused to confirm that the three were planning a bomb attack on Gibraltar . The team decided against using Adams ' interview , and only 45 seconds of the footage was used in the final cut . The journalists were keen to show the potential impact of a bomb like the one the IRA had planned to explode in Gibraltar ; they initially hoped to film a controlled explosion of a bomb of similar size , but no private contractor would conduct such an experiment without government approval . In lieu of filming an explosion , This Week interviewed Noreen Hill — whose husband was left in a coma as a result of a smaller bombing in Enniskillen in November 1987 — to " depict the human tragedy of IRA bombings " . They also filmed an interview with a second survivor of the Enniskillen bombing , which was not included in the final cut . 
 = = Conclusion = = 
 Based on the information his journalists had gathered from eyewitnesses in Gibraltar and that provided by the Spanish authorities , Bolton believed his team had enough to broadcast a documentary about the Gibraltar shootings . The journalists filmed those eyewitnesses who were willing to speak on camera . They also rented a helicopter , and — with the assistance of the Spanish authorities , who provided two police officers who had taken part in the operation — filmed a reconstruction of the Spanish surveillance operation . 
 Throughout the investigation , the authorities in Britain and Gibraltar refused to provide any information or to comment on the journalists ' findings . Thus , This Week were unable to present their conclusions to a member of the government and broadcast their reaction , as was the usual practice for closing such a documentary . In place of such a conclusion , Bolton approached George Carman — a leading London lawyer specialising in human rights issues — who agreed to be interviewed for the programme . 
 On 26 April , two days before " Death on the Rock " was due to air , the British government intervened to prevent its broadcast . Foreign secretary Sir Geoffrey Howe telephoned Lord Thomson , chair of the Independent Broadcasting Authority ( IBA ) , to request he force the postponement of the broadcast on the grounds that Howe feared the documentary might prejudice the coroner 's inquest . Thomson personally viewed " Death on the Rock " before making the final decision to permit its broadcast , with two alterations to the commentary . He later wrote that , " paradoxically " , the decision " was not a difficult one . My colleagues and I saw no reason why the IBA should prevent Thames ' journalists interviewing those who claimed to be eyewitnesses and investigating the affair as numerous other journalists had since the shootings , provided that the criminal record of the terrorists and the enormity of the outrage they planned was made clear and the legal position had been established to our satisfaction " . With a slightly altered rationale — that the documentary could contaminate witness evidence at the inquest — Howe again attempted to prevent the programme 's broadcast on the day it was due to be shown ; after taking further legal advice , the IBA upheld its decision to permit the showing of " Death on the Rock " . 
 = = Broadcast = = 
 Final editing of the programme was still under way while the IBA was considering Howe 's requests , causing Bolton to worry that it would not be completed in time . The editing was eventually finished just ten minutes before the documentary was due to air . " Death on the Rock " was ultimately broadcast in the United Kingdom on schedule , at 21 : 00 on 28 April 1988 , six weeks after the shootings . 
 The programme opened with excerpts from two of the interviews prior to the title sequence , followed by an introduction from Jonathan Dimbleby , who told viewers that the evidence presented in the programme was " of critical importance for those who wish to find out what really happened in Gibraltar last month " . The commentary cut to Manyon , who introduced Styles and discussed the impact the IRA 's bomb would have had , and then to Noreen Hill , whose husband was in a coma as a result of the Enniskillen bombing . Manyon pointed out that the IRA expressed regret after Enniskillen , but that they were by then already planning to attack Gibraltar . Manyon told viewers of the three IRA members ' backgrounds , before introducing an interview with an official from the Spanish Interior Ministry , who discussed the Spanish surveillance operation , of which viewers were shown a reconstruction with a voice @-@ over from Manyon . The programme reconstructed Savage 's movements as he crossed the border into Gibraltar , parked his car in the assembly area for the ceremony and met up with McCann and Farrell , after which it broadcast part of Howe 's statement to the House of Commons : " Their presence and actions near the parked Renault car gave rise to strong suspicion that it contained a bomb , which appeared to be corroborated by a rapid technical examination of the car " . Manyon explained that the vehicle was later found not to contain a bomb , and introduced Styles , who believed that such an examination would have shown that the car did not contain a bomb , as the weight would have been evident on the vehicle 's springs . 
 Manyon continued to narrate as the programme reconstructed the IRA team 's movements through Gibraltar towards the border until McCann and Farrell reached a petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue . " Then , suddenly " , Manyon told viewers , " shots rang out , and in less than a minute all three terrorists were dead — shot by the SAS " . The commentary again cut to Howe 's statement , after which Manyon detailed This Week 's investigation . He introduced the four eyewitnesses the journalists had discovered ( Diana Treacy , Josie Celecia , Stephen Bullock , and Carmen Proetta ) . Celecia described witnessing McCann and Farrell walking along Winston Churchill Avenue before hearing several shots , and then seeing a soldier continue to fire at the pair while they were on the ground . Proetta told the programme she saw a police car arrive opposite the petrol station , that three armed men in plain clothes then disembarked , jumped across the central barrier , and shot McCann and Farrell while the latter had their hands up . Bullock was interviewed walking the route he had walked on the day of the shootings ; his account was of two men in plain clothes shooting McCann and Farrell at very close range and continuing to shoot as the pair fell and while they were on the ground . Treacy , meanwhile , was walking along Landport Lane when Savage ran past her , pursued by at least one soldier . She stated that she did not hear any warning before Savage was shot ; she ran away after the shooting began . Asquez was not named in the broadcast ; his statement — that he saw a soldier firing at Savage while the latter was on the ground — was read out by an actor . 
 Styles told Manyon he believed it unlikely that the IRA would have succeeded in detonating a bomb in the assembly area from the petrol station where McCann and Farrell were shot ( a distance of approximately 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) ) . Returning to Proetta , the documentary heard her reaction to Howe 's statement that McCann and Farrell made threatening movements ; Proetta believed that the incident was triggered by the siren from the police car on Winston Churchill Avenue . She believed that any movements McCann and Farrell made were in response to the siren , and was adamant that the pair had their hands up when they were shot . Manyon summed up the programme 's findings : 
 no independent witnesses heard a challenge , 
 Proetta believed McCann and Farrell were shot with their hands up , 
 Treacy saw Savage shot in the back , 
 two witnesses claimed to have seen the IRA members " finished off " on the ground , 
 Styles believed the authorities should have known the car did not contain a bomb . 
 Carman — the QC recruited by Bolton — was the last contributor to the documentary . Presented with This Week 's evidence , he disagreed with Margaret Thatcher 's statement that the inquest would be sufficient to establish the facts of the incident . He opined that a more powerful judicial enquiry , possibly headed by a British High Court judge , would be better equipped to eliminate the inconsistencies between the official version of events and the eyewitness statements . In conclusion , Manyon asked Carman " do you believe this case is so important that the government should take such extraordinary steps in order to clarify the facts ? " Carman responded " the programme indicates there are serious , important public issues involved , and speaking as a lawyer , one is always anxious when there is contest on the facts in such important areas , they should be properly and efficiently investigated " . The documentary closed with Jonathan Dimbleby : 
 That report was made , as you may have detected , without the cooperation of the British government , which says it will make no comment until the inquest . 
 As our film contained much new evidence hitherto unavailable to the coroner , we are sending the transcripts to his court in Gibraltar , where it 's been made clear to us that all such evidence is welcomed . 
 From This Week , goodnight . 
 = = Reaction = = 
 The controversy surrounding " Death on the Rock " was " unsurpassed " in Lord Thomson 's experience . The morning after the broadcast , the British broadsheets appeared open @-@ minded or moderately favourable to This Week ; The Times told readers that " Death on the Rock " " seemed a significant , thoroughly responsible and serious examination of a most disturbing case " and that it " simply raised serious questions and suggested they needed deep examination " . The tabloids , however , berated the programme and its makers . The Sun accused the makers of a " cheap scoop " and labelled the programme " IRA propaganda " . The Daily Mail was equally robust ; its main headline read " fury over SAS ' trial by TV ' " , while in an inside article , it called the programme " woefully one @-@ sided " , and accused Bolton of having previously collaborated with the IRA for sensational news stories . That evening , Bolton agreed to appear on Channel 4 's Right of Reply , a show which allowed ordinary viewers to question the makers of controversial television programmes ; the programme was pre @-@ recorded , and , unusually , the producers agreed to cut the end of the recording after one of the participants — a former member of Margaret Thatcher 's personal staff claiming to be an impartial viewer — launched an attack on Bolton , in which he accused Bolton of associating with terrorists . 
 Beginning in the days after the broadcast of " Death on the Rock " , the British tabloid press mounted a campaign against Carmen Proetta , one of the documentary 's key witnesses . The day after the broadcast , the London Evening Standard printed a story about Proetta 's husband ; the piece — citing the Gibraltar Police press officer — claimed that Maxie Proetta was a drug smuggler well known to the Gibraltar Police . Over the course of the week , several of the tabloids ran stories claiming that Carmen Proetta ran an escort agency and that she was a former prostitute with a criminal record ; in one headline , The Sun labelled her " the tart of Gib " . Several stories also attempted to portray Proetta as anti @-@ British , including one in the broadsheet Daily Telegraph which claimed she was one of the 44 people who voted to end the British administration in Gibraltar 's 1967 referendum . In fact , Proetta had served briefly as a director of a Spanish tour company and had no criminal record in either Spain or Gibraltar ; her husband had been convicted for drug possession in Spain and was , at the time of the shootings , facing separate charges for allowing his boat to be used by drug smugglers . Proetta later sued The Sun and other newspapers for libel and won substantial damages . 
 The Sunday Times , meanwhile , attempted to undermine the programme 's credibility with its own investigative journalism . Citing " official sources " , the paper told its readers that This Week 's account of the shootings was " crucially flawed " , and " bore no resemblance to what happened " . It went on to claim that several of the programme 's witnesses felt that " Death on the Rock " had misrepresented their statements . It stated that the documentary 's technical advisor , Lieutenant Colonel George Styles , was aggrieved that two of his " key opinions " had been omitted from the version broadcast — specifically that what Proetta interpreted as a gesture of surrender may have been an involuntary reaction to the bullets striking the suspects ' bodies , and that the IRA members could still have detonated a bomb in another vehicle parked on the Spanish side of the border . The latter opinion was omitted because the This Week team saw little for the IRA to gain by detonating a bomb on Spanish soil , while the former was included in the broadcast . Josie Celecia , it alleged , had dismissed Proetta 's account as " ridiculous " , while Stephen Bullock had contradicted Proetta 's statement that she had seen plain @-@ clothed soldiers arriving in a police car — testimony The Sunday Times believed " destroyed " Proetta 's evidence . Both witnesses complained in letters to other newspapers . Through these , it emerged that Bullock had dismissed only one detail in Proetta 's evidence as " ridiculous " , while he and Proetta had been referring to two distinct police cars in their statements . The Sunday Times omitted Styles ' belief that the shootings were a pre @-@ emptive attack . Styles ' view was one of " two active service units waging war [ ... ] taking [ the IRA members ] out quickly , cleanly , and without other people being hurt — that seems to be the only way " . Several newspapers were critical of the IBA 's decision to allow the documentary to be broadcast . 
 = = Inquest = = 
 The witnesses uncovered during the production of " Death on the Rock " appeared at the inquest , which began on 6 September . One of the first civilians to give evidence was Allen <unk> , an explosives expert who worked for the Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) ; he confirmed Styles ' contribution to the documentary — that the IRA had not been known to use a remote @-@ detonated bomb without a direct line of sight to their target . The various expert witnesses at the inquest disagreed as to whether a detonation signal could have reached the parked Renault from the scenes of the shootings . Multiple eyewitnesses gave evidence over the course of the inquest . Four gave evidence which broadly supported the official version of events ; in particular , none saw the soldiers shoot McCann , Savage , or Farrell while they were on the ground . The witnesses from " Death on the Rock " also appeared . Stephen Bullock told the coroner that he saw McCann and Savage raise their hands before seeing the SAS shoot them at point blank range . Josie Celecia 's evidence — that she saw a soldier shooting at McCann and Farrell while the pair were on the ground — was stringently challenged by government lawyers , who pointed out that her account had changed somewhat since she had appeared on camera and that she was unable to identify the SAS soldiers from photographs taken by her husband . 
 Maxie Proetta appeared on 22 September . He told the coroner that he had witnessed four men ( three in plain clothes and one uniformed Gibraltar Police officer ) arriving opposite the petrol station on Winston Churchill Avenue ; the men jumped over the central reservation barrier and Farrell put her hands up , after which he heard a series of shots . In contrast to his wife 's testimony , he believed that Farrell 's gesture was one of self @-@ defence rather than surrender , and he believed that the shots he heard did not come from the men from the police car . The government lawyers suggested that the police car he and his wife had seen was one seen by other eyewitnesses further south , and that it was responding to the shootings rather than transporting soldiers , but Mr Proetta was adamant that the lawyers ' suggestion did not make sense . Carmen Proetta appeared the following day . Mrs Proetta 's testimony contained some discrepancies with the evidence she gave to " Death on the Rock " ; she was no longer certain that she had seen the SAS shoot McCann and Savage while the latter were on the ground , because she could not recall seeing shell casings being ejected from the soldiers ' weapons . The government lawyers questioned the reliability of Proetta 's evidence based on her changes , and implied that she behaved suspiciously by giving evidence to " Death on the Rock " before the police . She responded that the police had not spoken to her about the shootings until after " Death on the Rock " had been shown . Asquez , who provided an unsworn statement to the programme through an intermediary , reluctantly appeared at the inquest . He retracted the statements he had given to the journalists , which he claimed he had made up after " pestering " from Major Bob Randall ( who had sold the programme a video recording of the aftermath of the shootings ) . The British tabloids covered Asquez 's retraction extensively , while several members of parliament accused " Death on the Rock " of manipulating Asquez in an attempt to discredit the SAS and the British government . However , Asquez 's statement contained several details that were not released publicly , and which only entered the public domain during the inquest , though , when questioned by the coroner , Asquez said he could not explain the discrepancy because he was " a bit confused " . The inquest concluded on 30 September and the jury returned a verdict of lawful killing . 
 Following the inquest , the families of McCann , Savage , and Farrell applied to the European Commission of Human Rights for an opinion on whether the authorities ' actions in Gibraltar violated Article 2 ( the " right to life " ) of the European Convention on Human Rights ( ECHR ) ; This Week 's journalists provided statements to the commission regarding the Spanish surveillance operation ( the existence of which had been denied by the British authorities at the inquest ) . The commission 's report found no violation of Article 2 , but the commission referred the case to the European Court of Human Rights ( ECtHR ) for a final decision . The court rejected the families ' submission that the British government had conspired to kill the three , but did find a violation of Article 2 in the defective planning and control of the operation . Nevertheless , the applicants ' claim for damages was dismissed on the grounds that the trio had been killed while preparing an act of terrorism , though it did order the government to pay the applicants ' costs . 
 = = Windlesham – Rampton Report = = 
 Following Asquez 's retraction of his statement and his allegation that he was pressured into giving a false account of the events he witnessed , the IBA contacted Thames to express its concern and to raise the possibility of an investigation into the making of the documentary . Thames eventually agreed to commission an independent inquiry into the programme ( the first such inquiry into an individual programme ) , to be conducted by two people with no connection to either Thames or the IBA ; to that end , Thames engaged Lord Windlesham and Richard Rampton , QC . Windlesham was a Conservative politician , privy councillor , and former minister in the Home Office and then the Northern Ireland Office ; he also had experience of television journalism , having previously managed two television companies . Rampton was a leading barrister specialising in media law and libel . The inquiry 's terms of reference were " to inquire into the making and screening of ' Death on the Rock ' " , including its creation , production , content , and any effect it had had on the inquest . 
 The report found that the tendency of the evidence presented in the programme was to suggest the terrorists had been unlawfully killed , and that it did not explore alternative explanations in any depth . Nevertheless , Windlesham and Rampton believed that the programme presented evidence for one possible explanation , but sought to raise questions rather than reach a conclusion . In analysing the content of the programme , they found that it allowed the witnesses to give their accounts in their own words rather than presenting them as established fact . Thus , they found that the content did not infringe any requirement for neutrality . The report scrutinised in detail the statements of the eyewitnesses who spoke on camera , including the parts of the interviews that were not included in the broadcast version of the programme . It found , with two exceptions , that the witnesses ' statements were fairly represented in the programme . The exceptions were that the programme suggested that Bullock had not heard a warning , when he was in no position to hear whether such a warning was given or not ; and that the commentary implied that all four witnesses who appeared on the programme had seen no threatening movements from the IRA members , when only two had been asked whether they witnessed such movements . Windlesham and Rampton also considered Asquez 's statement and the journalists ' decision to incorporate it into the programme . The report considered that the journalists acted reasonably in using the statement , despite Asquez 's refusal to sign it , on the grounds that Asquez had given two separate , near @-@ identical statements ( including one to a lawyer ) , and that they considered it unlikely that somebody would invent such a dramatic account . Nonetheless , the report criticised the programme for not informing viewers of Asquez 's refusal to sign the statement . 
 The Foreign and Commonwealth Office ( FCO ) made representations to the inquiry that " Death on the Rock " could potentially have had an adverse effect on the inquest on the same grounds that Howe had attempted to delay the broadcast . The first was that the programme might have been seen by members of the inquest jury , and could thus have caused them to reach a conclusion on the shootings before hearing the evidence at the inquest . Considering this submission , the report agreed with the opinions of lawyers consulted by Thames and the IBA that " Death on the Rock " was safe to be broadcast on 28 April 1988 . The report considered that Thames withheld distribution of " Death on the Rock " from Gibraltar and Spain specifically to address such concerns , though it was widely discussed in British newspapers ( which are widely sold in the territory ) and extracts later became available in Gibraltar . The report concluded it was foreseeable that the content of " Death on the Rock " would become known in Gibraltar , but that it would not have prejudiced potential jurors as , in the authors ' opinion , the programme raised one possibility , but did not seek to present it as the only possible version of events . The second was that the programme might have contaminated the evidence presented at the inquest , as witnesses might have been tempted to give false or embellished accounts for the television . The report dismissed this concern ; the authors believed that all the eyewitnesses gave honest accounts of what they believed they saw , and pointed out that three had given statements to the Gibraltar Police and two had been interviewed by Gibraltarian and British newspapers prior to being interviewed for " Death on the Rock " . 
 Overall , Windlesham and Rampton found " Death on the Rock " to be a " trenchant " work of journalism , made in " good faith and without ulterior motives " . In conclusion , the authors believed that " Death on the Rock " proved that " freedom of expression can prevail in the most extensive , and the most immediate , of all the means of mass communication " . 
 The terms of reference of the report did not invite any recommendations , nor did the authors offer any .

 " Death on the Rock " was highly praised within the television industry and went on to win the BAFTA Award for Best Documentary and an award from the Broadcasting Press Guild . 
 Two other programmes were made about the Gibraltar shootings for British television , both by the BBC . BBC Northern Ireland produced an episode of Spotlight which arrived at similar findings to those of This Week ; Howe attempted to have the programme delayed , using the same rationale with which he requested " Death on the Rock " be postponed . The programme was eventually broadcast , but restricted to Northern Ireland . The BBC 's flagship current affairs series Panorama made a programme about the SAS and its role in the Troubles to coincide with the end of the Gibraltar inquest ; it was postponed by BBC executives in the wake of the controversy surrounding " Death on the Rock " . 
 Academic Christian <unk> described " Death on the Rock " as part of a decade of " unprecedented conflict between government and broadcasters over ... investigative documentaries " . Margaret Thatcher " utterly rejected " the findings of the Windlesham – Rampton report . After the reforms brought in by the Broadcasting Act 1990 , the process of bidding for ITV franchises was overhauled in an attempt to introduce greater competition . In the subsequent auction , Thames Television lost its contract ; several journalists and former Thames employees speculated that the Act was the government 's revenge for " Death on the Rock " . This Week ceased after Thames lost its franchise . Lord Thomson , chairman of the IBA , believed the dispute between the government and the authority had a " very substantial influence on Mrs Thatcher 's attitude towards broadcasting policy " , which led her to the belief that Thames ' franchise should not be renewed . The 1990 Act abolished the IBA , which Thomson believed was directly related the authority 's decision to permit the showing of " Death on the Rock " .

 = Eystein I of Norway = 
 Eystein Magnusson ( Old Norse : Eysteinn Magnússon , Norwegian : Øystein Magnusson ; c . 1088 – 29 August 1123 ) was King of Norway ( as Eystein I ) from 1103 to 1123 together with his brothers Sigurd the Crusader and Olaf Magnusson , although since Olaf died before adulthood , only Eystein and Sigurd were effective rulers of the country . 
 While Sigurd gained fame as the " warrior king " ( although owed almost exclusively to his three @-@ year crusade to the Holy Land ) , Eystein was in contrast portrayed in the sagas as the " peace king " who stayed home in Norway and improved the country . As Eystein never engaged in warfare , considerably less information is written and known about him than about his brother Sigurd , despite his twenty @-@ year @-@ long reign , just a few years short of Sigurd . Eystein nonetheless gained the affection of his people , and was highly regarded by the saga writers for his deeds . Eystein and Sigurd 's reign became the longest joint rule in Norwegian history . 
 Although the later saga literature narrates stereotypical accounts about the two kings , Eystein is known to have improved the infrastructure and raised buildings and churches , particularly across the coast in Western Norway and Trøndelag , from Bergen to the fishing centre of Lofoten in the north . Eystein 's activities were especially centered in Bergen , which became an important international trade hub for fish at the time , helped by his construction projects . His activities in Bergen included moving the royal seat to a more central location in the city and building a new royal palace , as well as constructing churches and the Munkeliv Abbey . 
 Eystein died of illness in August 1123 , and his brother Sigurd thereby became the sole Norwegian king . 
 = = Background = = 
 Eystein was born in 1088 or 1089 as the first son of the future king Magnus Barefoot , born to an otherwise unknown mother who is only recorded to have been of " low birth " . Upon the death of his father in 1103 during one of his campaigns in Ireland , Eystein became king together with his two brothers Olaf and Sigurd , all of whom had different mothers . Sigurd was about a year younger than Eystein , while Olaf was more than ten years younger than him . Sigurd was the only son who had accompanied their father Magnus on his campaign in the West , but he returned to Norway after Magnus ' death . 
 Many accounts concerning Eystein in later sagas are characterized by literary motifs , and have little value as sources on his life . Snorri Sturluson , the Icelandic author of the early 13th century Heimskringla mastered this literary style particularly well , stylistically and psychologically . His stories includes a so @-@ called <unk> ( literally " comparison of men " ) between Eystein and Sigurd , in which the two boast about their skills and deeds in an attempt to outdo each other . In a similar fashion , Snorri also tells a story about how Eystein managed to cure the melancholy of a friend , by agreeing to regularly clear time to talk with him about what troubled him . On his physical appearance , Snorri wrote that Eystein " was the handsomest man that could be seen . He had blue open eyes ; his hair yellow and curling ; his stature not tall , but of the middle size . " More reliable information , particularly about Eystein 's building @-@ projects , is offered in earlier sagas such as the work of Theodoric the Monk , a Norwegian chronicler who wrote in the late 12th century . 
 = = Reign = = 
 The co @-@ rule between Eystein , Sigurd and Olaf entailed a shared kingship , and the kingdom itself was not divided into fixed borders . During the early years of their reign , Eystein is nonetheless said to have stayed mostly in Western Norway and Trøndelag , while Sigurd was in Viken . In practice , only Eystein and Sigurd ever ruled as kings , as Olaf was considerably younger and died when he was only seventeen years old , and virtually nothing is known about him beyond his name . One of the earliest acts by the kings was passing a <unk> , a special law ordained by the king , which among other things abolished various royal taxes that originated from the Danish rule of Sweyn <unk> and Ælfgifu ( under Cnut the Great ) in the early 1030s . The kings became very popular because of this . According to some sources , the main motivation for abolishing the taxes was to gain the support of the population for Sigurd 's planned crusade . 
 In 1107 or 1108 , after years of preparations , Sigurd sailed with a large fleet on a crusade to the Holy Land , the first European king ever to do so . Sigurd arrived back in Norway in 1111 . Eystein , on the other hand , did not engage in any warfare , and considerably less information is thus written about him than about Sigurd , although Snorri notes that he " had also effected much in the country that was useful while King Sigurd was on his journey . " While Sigurd gained fame in posterity as the " warrior king " , although mainly because of his one @-@ time crusade , Eystein was portrayed by the saga writers as the " peace king " who stayed at home and improved the country . Since Sigurd remained king for nineteen years after his crusade with little controversy , historian Claus Krag has considered that the domestic peace probably could be attributed equally to Sigurd . In order to contrast Eystein with Sigurd , Snorri tells a story that Eystein instead subdued Jämtland to the Norwegian crown peacefully through the use of gifts and diplomacy . Despite Snorri 's account , historical records indicate that Jämtland did not succumb to Norwegian rule until much later , during the reign of King Sverre in 1178 . Eystein and Sigurd are , however , known to have claimed monopoly on the trade and taxation in <unk> . 
 Fish became an increasingly important commodity during Eystein 's reign , as more cod was fished in Northern Norway and the demand for stockfish soared in Europe . As the most suitable port , Bergen became the main trade hub for exporting stockfish , including trade connections with Grimsby in England , while it also served to import much needed goods such as grain and flour . To further the trade , Eystein had fishing booths and a church built in the fishing centre at Vågan in Lofoten in Northern Norway , and he sailed north to Lofoten and Trondenes himself in 1114 . He also secured the route along the coast by constructing a port in Agdenes on the mouth of the Trondheimsfjord , as well as smaller beacons along the coast . Eystein 's port construction in Agdenes was compared by Theodoric the Monk to that of Augustus Caesar at Brundisium , an association readily reflected by Theodoric 's use of the Latinised name form " <unk> " for Eystein . ( Otherwise , Pope Callixtus II calls Eystein " <unk> " in a letter . ) The existence of a now lost port in Agdenes dated to around Eystein 's reign has been supported by recent archaeological surveys in the area . Snorri also says that Eystein had several large dry @-@ docks built in Nidaros , and that he had a large ship built which " in size and shape " resembled the great ship Ormen Lange once built by King Olaf Tryggvason . Eystein also improved the shelters in the mountain passes , notably at Hjerkinn in Dovre , to more comfortable houses with permanent supervision . 
 In Snorri 's <unk> between Eystein and Sigurd , Eystein allegedly maintains that his own building @-@ projects in Norway were " more useful for the country , " than " you [ Sigurd ] killing <unk> for the devil in Serkland . " Eystein was particularly active in Bergen , and his role in the development of the city was probably more important than that of King Olaf Kyrre , the founder of the city according to the sagas . He moved the royal seat in the city from <unk> to Holmen on the eastern shore of Vågen , in the city core , thereby rationalising the bureaucracy . At Holmen , he built a Church of the Apostles ( probably a stave church ) and a St. Nicholas Church , as well as a royal palace which according to Snorri Sturluson was the most imposing wooden building ever raised in Norway ( although Theodoric the Monk who wrote earlier already noted it was " now almost collapsed from excessive age " ) . He also built a St. Michael 's Church and founded the Benedictine abbey Munkeliv Abbey at <unk> , and the tithe to the church was introduced during the reign of Eystein and Sigurd . 
 Eystein died on 29 August 1123 , not long after he was " seized with an illness " during a feast at Hustad in Fræna , Møre og Romsdal . Snorri tells that his body thereafter was taken to Nidaros , and buried in the Nidaros Cathedral . According to Snorri , it was " generally said that so many mourners never stood over any man 's grave in Norway as over King Eystein 's , " at least since the death of Magnus the Good . The reign of Eystein and Sigurd was the longest joint rule in Norwegian history . Sigurd ruled alone after Eystein 's death , until Sigurd 's own death in 1130 . 
 = = Family = = 
 Eystein married <unk> <unk> , from a prominent noble family of Gudbrandsdalen . Their marriage was part of Eystein 's strategy of building alliances in Eastern Norway . They had a daughter , Maria , who became the mother of the future royal pretender Olaf <unk> by her marriage to the <unk> Gudbrand <unk> . Olaf was named king in 1165 , during the Norwegian civil war era , but was subsequently defeated by Magnus <unk> and forced to flee the country . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 Opinions on Eystein have been strongly favourable . Theodoric the Monk wrote about Eystein that he " was a paragon of honesty who governed himself no less than his subjects with moderation and wisdom . He was a king who loved peace , an assiduous manager of public affairs , and above all a <unk> of the Christian religion . " Snorri Sturluson later wrote that Eystein " was wise , intelligent , and acquainted with the laws and history . He had much knowledge of mankind , was quick in counsel , prudent in words , and very eloquent and very generous . He was very merry , yet modest ; and was liked and beloved , indeed , by all the people . " The view of Eystein as a peaceful and domestically active king has been supported by modern historians such as Claus Krag , although noting that the literary embellishments should be disregarded . 
 A stylized marble bust of Eystein , dated to before the middle of the 12th century , was found during excavations at Munkeliv Abbey in 1853 , and it represents the oldest known preserved portrait of a Norwegian king . The bust has the inscription " <unk> REX " , and was originally probably part of a full figure statue built into the wall . The headpiece worn on the bust has been said to resemble a German Imperial crown , or to be of a Byzantine type . According to Snorri Sturluson , Eystein had " somewhat large eyes " , which seems to correspond with the bust . Since Snorri may have seen the bust in Bergen himself , it is unclear if his account represents an independent source on Eystein 's physical appearance . Today , the bust is located in the collections of Bergen Museum . 
 To commemorate his status as founder of the fishing town Vågan ( although it had been an important centre for at least a century ) , a huge statue of Eystein ( <unk> ) by Arthur <unk> was raised at Breidablikk in Vågan in 1935 , after an idea of <unk> Harald Sund . At Hjerkinn in Dovre , a church dedicated to Eystein ( <unk> ) was constructed in 1969 according to a design by Magnus Poulsson , in commemoration of Eystein 's construction of a <unk> or shelter near the village . 
 = Dongan Charter = 
 The Dongan Charter is the 1686 document incorporating Albany , New York as a city . Albany 's charter was issued by Governor Thomas Dongan of the Province of New York , a few months after Governor Dongan issued a similarly worded , but less detailed charter for the city of New York . The city of Albany was created three years after Albany County . The charter is the oldest existing city charter still in force in the United States and " arguably in all the Western Hemisphere " , according to Stefan <unk> , former senior historian of the New York State Museum . In 1936 the United States Congress commemorated the charter 's 250th anniversary by minting a half dollar coin . 
 = = History = = 
 After the city of New York received a municipal charter from Governor Dongan the governor came to Albany , at which time the village sent a delegation of prominent men to request a charter of their own . The Patroon , after being encouraged by the governor , finally released all claims to Albany and forfeited a strip of land 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) wide and 16 miles ( 26 km ) long to Albany . Albany at the time consisted of about 500 residents living in around 140 houses . In July 1686 a delegation led by Pieter Schuyler and Robert Livingston traveled to New York to receive the charter for Albany ; the charter was signed on July 25 , 1686 and was read aloud to the citizens of Albany three days later . Due to England , and by extension Albany , using the Julian calendar at the time , the corrected date for the signing of the document under the Gregorian calendar is August 1 , 1686 . 
 During Leisler 's Rebellion Jacob Leisler demanded the charters of Albany and the city of New York be forfeited , and New York yielded but Albany 's mayor , Pieter Schuyler , refused . Schuyler went on to become one of the major leaders in suppressing the rebellion . The next major threat to the charter government came during the American Revolution when the Common Council stopped meeting in 1775 . The local Committee of Safety took over daily functions until 1778 when the Common Council began meeting again . 
 A Dongan Charter Parade was held in 1936 for the 250th anniversary celebrations , and as part of the ceremonies the United States Congress authorized the minting of an Albany Charter half dollar coin . Tricentennial celebrations held in 1986 included a re @-@ enactment of the signing and awarding of the charter by Governor Mario Cuomo playing Governor Dongan , and Mayor Thomas Whalen playing Mayor Schuyler . Other events during the tricentennial were fireworks , music , the unveiling of a tricentennial clock , a hot @-@ air balloon lift @-@ off from Lincoln Park , and a cake large enough to feed thousands . Mayors from other <unk> around the world were among the visiting dignitaries who were invited to the ceremonies and given a tour of the city by Mayor Whalen . 
 = = Provisions = = 
 The charter turned the village of Albany into a city under the name of " The Mayor , Aldermen , and Commonalty of the city of Albany " ; this legally separated it from Rensselaerswyck , a nearby colonial estate . The charter also established Albany 's boundaries and a municipal government , as well as specifically naming the first officers . Certain special rights were put into the charter as well , such as the exclusive right to negotiate with the Native Americans . It also established Albany as the sole market town in the upper Hudson region , with the right to purchase land at <unk> and Schaghticoke . 
 The mayor of Albany was the executive officer and selected by the Lieutenant Governor . He was also designated as the clerk of the marketplace and the coroner for both the city and Albany County . Two alderman and two assistant aldermen were chosen from each ward and sat on the Common Council along with the mayor and recorder . The mayor , recorder , and aldermen were also justices , the assistants however did not have any judicial powers . 
 The sole right to issue trading privileges anywhere in Albany County rested with the mayor and Common Council . Albany County encompassed all of Upstate New York north and west of Ulster County at that time , as well as the state of Vermont . All residents of New York , except those of Albany , were specifically banned from trading with any Iroquois nation , or with any other native tribe to the west , east , or north of the city of Albany , or with native tribes anywhere within Albany County . 
 = = Amendments = = 
 The Dongan Charter was first amended on March 21 , 1787 to remove the mayor 's powers to act as the city and county 's sole coroner , and to regulate trade with Indians . It continued to be used with only minor changes until March 16 , 1870 , when it saw major changes by the state legislature in 1870 and 1883 . In the 1870 revision the name of the city was changed from " The Mayor , Aldermen , and Commonalty of the city of Albany " to the " City of Albany " . In 1998 the people of Albany adopted a revised charter as an amendment to the Dongan Charter .

 = Rosewood massacre = 
 The Rosewood massacre was a violent , racially motivated massacre of blacks and destruction of a black town that took place during the first week of January 1923 in rural Levy County , Florida . At least six blacks and two whites were killed , and the town of Rosewood was abandoned and destroyed in what contemporary news reports characterized as a race riot . Racial disturbances were common during the early 20th century in the United States , reflecting the nation 's rapid social changes . Florida had an especially high number of lynchings of black males in the years before the massacre , including a well @-@ publicized incident in December 1922 . 
 Prior to the massacre , the town of Rosewood had been a quiet , primarily black , self @-@ sufficient whistle stop on the Seaboard Air Line Railway . Trouble began when white men from several nearby towns lynched a black Rosewood resident because of unsupported accusations that a white woman in nearby Sumner had been beaten and possibly raped by a black drifter . When the town 's black citizens rallied together to defend themselves against further attacks , a mob of several hundred whites combed the countryside hunting for black people , and burned almost every structure in Rosewood . Survivors from the town hid for several days in nearby swamps until they were evacuated by train and car to larger towns . Although state and local authorities were aware of the violence , no arrests were made for what happened in Rosewood . The town was abandoned by its former black residents ; none ever moved back . 
 Although the rioting was widely reported around the United States at the time , few official records documented the event . Survivors , their descendants , and the perpetrators remained silent about Rosewood for decades . Sixty years after the rioting , the story of Rosewood was revived in major media when several journalists covered it in the early 1980s . Survivors and their descendants organized to sue the state for having failed to protect Rosewood 's black community . In 1993 , the Florida Legislature commissioned a report on the massacre . As a result of the findings , Florida became the first U.S. state to compensate survivors and their descendants for damages incurred because of racial violence . The incident was the subject of a 1997 feature film directed by John Singleton . In 2004 , the state designated the site of Rosewood as a Florida Heritage Landmark . Officially , the recorded death toll of the first week of January 1923 was six blacks and two whites . Historians disagree about this number . Some survivors ' stories claim there may have been up to 27 black residents killed , and assert that newspapers did not report the total number of white deaths . Minnie Lee Langley , who was in the Carrier house siege , recalls that she stepped over many white bodies on the porch when she left the house . Several eyewitnesses claim to have seen a mass grave filled with black people ; one remembers a plow brought from Cedar Key that covered 26 bodies . Others claimed as many as 150 people were killed . However , by the time authorities investigated these claims , most of the witnesses were dead , or too elderly and infirm to lead them to a site to confirm the stories . 
 = = Background = = 
 = = = Settlement = = = 
 Rosewood was settled in 1845 , nine miles ( 14 km ) east of Cedar Key , near the Gulf of Mexico . Most of the local economy drew on the timber industry ; the name Rosewood refers to the reddish color of cut cedar wood . Two pencil mills were founded nearby in Cedar Key ; local residents also worked in several turpentine mills and a sawmill three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) away in Sumner , in addition to farming of citrus and cotton . The hamlet grew enough to warrant the construction of a post office and train depot on the Florida Railroad in 1870 , but it was never incorporated as a town . 
 Initially , Rosewood had both black and white settlers . When most of the cedar trees in the area had been cut by 1890 , the pencil mills closed , and many white residents moved to Sumner . By 1900 , the population in Rosewood had become predominantly black . The village of Sumner was predominantly white , and relations between the two communities were relatively amicable . Two black families in Rosewood named Goins and Carrier were the most powerful . The Goins family brought the turpentine industry to the area , and in the years preceding the attacks were the second largest landowners in Levy County . To avoid lawsuits from white competitors , the Goins brothers moved to Gainesville , and the population of Rosewood decreased slightly . The Carriers were also a large family , primarily working at logging in the region . By the 1920s , almost everyone in the close @-@ knit community was distantly related to each other . The population of Rosewood peaked in 1915 at 355 people . Florida had effectively disenfranchised blacks since the start of the 20th century by high requirements for voter registration ; both Sumner and Rosewood were part of a single voting precinct counted by the U.S. Census . In 1920 , the combined population of both towns was 344 blacks and 294 whites . 
 As was common in the late 19th century South , Florida had imposed legal racial segregation under Jim Crow laws requiring separate black and white public facilities and transportation . Blacks and whites created their own community centers : by 1920 , the residents of Rosewood were mostly self @-@ sufficient . They had three churches , a school , a large Masonic Hall , a turpentine mill , a sugarcane mill , a baseball team named the Rosewood Stars , and two general stores , one of which was white @-@ owned . The village had about a dozen two @-@ story wooden plank homes , other small two @-@ room houses , and several small unoccupied plank farm and storage structures . Some families owned pianos , organs , and other symbols of middle @-@ class prosperity . Survivors of Rosewood remember it as a happy place . In 1995 , survivor Robie Mortin recalled at age 79 that when she was a child there , that " Rosewood was a town where everyone 's house was painted . There were roses everywhere you walked . Lovely . " 
 = = = Racial tensions in Florida = = = 
 Racial violence at the time was common throughout the nation , manifested as individual incidents of extra @-@ legal actions , or attacks on entire communities . <unk> reached a peak around the start of the 20th century as southern states were disenfranchising blacks and imposing white supremacy ; whites used it as a means of social control throughout the South . In 1866 Florida , as did many Southern states , passed laws called Black Codes disenfranchising black citizens . Although these were quickly overturned , and black citizens enjoyed a brief period of improved social standing , by the late 19th century black political influence was virtually nil . The white Democrat @-@ dominated legislature passed a poll tax in 1885 , which largely served to disenfranchise poor whites and blacks alike . Losing political power , blacks suffered a deterioration of their legal and political rights in the years following . Without the right to vote , blacks were excluded as jurors and could not run for office , effectively excluding them from the political process . The United States as a whole was experiencing rapid social changes : an influx of European immigrants , industrialization and the growth of cities , and political experimentation in the North . In the South , black Americans grew increasingly dissatisfied with their lack of economic opportunity and status as second @-@ class citizens . 
 Elected officials in Florida represented the voting white majority . Governor Napoleon Bonaparte Broward ( 1905 – 1909 ) suggested finding a location out of state for blacks to live separately . Tens of thousands of blacks moved to the North during and after World War I in the Great Migration , unsettling labor markets and introducing more rapid changes into cities . They were recruited by many expanding northern industries , such as the Pennsylvania Railroad , the steel industry , and meatpacking . Florida governors Park Trammell ( 1913 – 1917 ) and Sidney Catts ( 1917 – 1921 ) generally ignored the emigration of blacks to the North and its causes . While Trammell was state attorney general , none of the 29 lynchings committed during his term was prosecuted , nor were any of the 21 that occurred while he was governor . Catts ran on a platform of white supremacy and anti @-@ Catholic sentiment ; he openly criticized the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People ( NAACP ) when they complained he did nothing to investigate two lynchings in Florida . Catts changed his message when the turpentine and lumber industries claimed labor was scarce ; he began to plead with black workers to stay in the state . By 1940 , 40 @,@ 000 blacks had left Florida to find employment , but also to escape the oppression of segregation , underfunded education and facilities , violence , and disenfranchisement . 
 When U.S. troop training began for World War I , many white Southerners were alarmed at the thought of arming black soldiers . A confrontation regarding the rights of black soldiers culminated in the Houston Riot of 1917 . German propaganda encouraged black soldiers to turn against their " real " enemies : American whites . Rumors reached the U.S. that French women had been sexually active with black American soldiers , which University of Florida historian David Colburn argues struck at the heart of Southern fears about power and miscegenation . Colburn connects growing concerns of sexual intimacy between the races to what occurred in Rosewood : " Southern culture had been constructed around a set of mores and values which places white women at its center and in which the purity of their conduct and their manners represented the refinement of that culture . An attack on women not only represented a violation of the South 's foremost taboo , but it also threatened to dismantle the very nature of southern society . " The transgression of sexual taboos subsequently combined with the arming of blacks to raise fears among whites of an impending race war in the South . 
 The influx of blacks into urban centers in the North and Midwest increased racial tensions in those cities . Between 1917 and 1923 , racial disturbances erupted in numerous cities throughout the U.S. , motivated by economic competition for industrial jobs , mostly between ethnic whites , immigrants and their descendants , and southern blacks , who were often used as strikebreakers . One of the first and most violent instances was a riot in East St. Louis , sparked in 1917 . In the Red Summer of 1919 , racially motivated mob violence erupted in 23 cities — including Chicago , Omaha , and Washington , D.C. — caused by competition for jobs and housing by returning World War I veterans of both races , and the arrival of waves of new European immigrants . Further unrest occurred in Tulsa in 1921 , when whites attacked the black Greenwood community . David Colburn distinguishes two types of violence against blacks up to 1923 : Northern violence was generally spontaneous mob action against entire communities . Southern violence , on the other hand , took the form of individual incidents of lynchings and other extrajudicial actions . The Rosewood massacre , according to Colburn , resembled violence more commonly perpetrated in the North in those years . 
 In the mid @-@ 1920s , the Ku Klux Klan ( KKK ) reached its peak membership in the South and Midwest after a revival beginning around 1915 . Its growth was due in part to tensions from rapid industrialization and social change in many growing cities ; in the Midwest and West , its growth was related to the competition of waves of new immigrants from Southern and Eastern Europe . The KKK was strong in the Florida cities of Jacksonville and Tampa ; Miami 's chapter was influential enough to hold initiations at the Miami Country Club . The Klan also flourished in smaller towns of the South where racial violence had a long tradition dating back to the Reconstruction era . An editor of The Gainesville Daily Sun admitted that he was a member of the Klan in 1922 , and praised the organization in print . 
 Despite Governor Catts ' change of attitude , white mob action frequently occurred in towns throughout north and central Florida and went unchecked by local law enforcement . Extrajudicial violence against blacks was so common that it seldom was covered by newspapers . In 1920 , whites removed four black men from jail , who were suspects accused of raping a white woman in <unk> , and lynched them . In Ocoee the same year , two black citizens armed themselves to go to the polls during an election . A confrontation ensued and two white election officials were shot , after which a white mob destroyed Ocoee 's black community , causing as many as 30 deaths , and destroying 25 homes , two churches , and a Masonic Lodge . Just weeks before the Rosewood massacre , the Perry Race Riot occurred on 14 and 15 December 1922 , in which whites burned Charles Wright at the stake and attacked the black community of Perry , Florida after a white schoolteacher was murdered . On the day following Wright 's lynching , whites shot and hanged two more black men in Perry ; next they burned the town 's black school , Masonic lodge , church , amusement hall , and several families ' homes .

 The Rosewood massacre occurred after a white woman in Sumner claimed she had been assaulted by a black man . Frances " Fannie " Taylor was 22 years old in 1923 and married to James , a 30 @-@ year @-@ old millwright employed by <unk> & Sons in Sumner . They lived there with their two young children . James ' job required him to leave each day during the darkness of early morning . Neighbors remembered Fannie Taylor as " very peculiar " . She was meticulously clean , scrubbing her cedar floors with bleach so that they shone white . Other women attested that Taylor was aloof ; no one knew her very well . 
 On January 1 , 1923 , the Taylors ' neighbor reported that she heard a scream while it was still dark , grabbed her revolver and ran next door to find Fannie bruised and beaten , with <unk> marks across the white floor . Taylor was screaming that someone needed to get her baby . She said a black man was in her house ; he had come through the back door and assaulted her . The neighbor found the baby , but no one else . Taylor 's initial report stated her assailant beat her about the face but did not rape her . Rumors circulated — widely believed by whites in Sumner — that she was both raped and robbed . The charge of rape of a white woman by a black was inflammatory in the South : the day before , the Klan had held a parade and rally of over 100 hooded Klansmen 50 miles ( 80 km ) away in Gainesville under a burning cross and a banner reading , " First and Always Protect Womanhood " . 
 The neighbor also reported the absence that day of Taylor 's laundress , Sarah Carrier , whom the white women in Sumner called " Aunt Sarah " . Philomena Goins , Carrier 's granddaughter , told a different story about Fannie Taylor many years later . She joined her grandmother Carrier at Taylor 's home as usual that morning . They watched a white man leave by the back door later in the morning before noon . She said Taylor did emerge from her home showing evidence of having been beaten , but it was well after morning . Carrier 's grandson and Philomena 's brother , Arnett Goins , sometimes went with them ; he had seen the white man before . His name was John Bradley and he worked for the Seaboard Air Line Railway . Carrier told others in the black community what she had seen that day ; the black community of Rosewood understood that Fannie Taylor had a white lover , they got into a fight that day , and he beat her . When the man left Taylor 's house , he went to Rosewood . 
 Quickly , Levy County Sheriff Robert Elias Walker raised a posse and started an investigation . When they learned that Jesse Hunter , a black prisoner , had escaped from a chain gang , they began a search to question him about Taylor 's attack . Men arrived from Cedar Key , Otter Creek , Chiefland , and Bronson to help with the search . Adding confusion to the events recounted later , as many as 400 white men began to gather . Sheriff Walker deputized some of them , but was unable to initiate them all . Walker asked for dogs from a nearby convict camp , but one dog may have been used by a group of men acting without Walker 's authority . Dogs led a group of about 100 to 150 men to the home of Aaron Carrier , Sarah 's nephew . Aaron was taken outside , where his mother begged the men not to kill him . He was tied to a car and dragged to Sumner . Sheriff Walker put Carrier in protective custody at the county seat in Bronson to remove him from the men in the posse , many of whom were drinking and acting on their own authority . Worried that the group would quickly grow further out of control , Walker also urged black employees to stay at the turpentine mills for their own safety . 
 A group of white vigilantes , who had become a mob by this time , seized Sam Carter , a local blacksmith and teamster who worked in a turpentine still . They tortured Carter into admitting that he had hidden the escaped chain gang prisoner . Carter led the group to the spot in the woods where he said he had taken Hunter , but the dogs were unable to pick up a scent . To the surprise of many witnesses , someone fatally shot Carter in the face . The group hung Carter 's mutilated body from a tree as a symbol to other black men in the area . Some in the mob took souvenirs of his clothes . Survivors suggest that John Bradley fled to Rosewood because he knew he was in trouble and had gone to the home of Aaron Carrier , a fellow veteran and Mason . Carrier and Carter , another Mason , covered Bradley in the back of a wagon . Carter took Bradley to a nearby river , let him out of the wagon , then returned home to be met by the mob ; they had reached him led by dogs following Bradley 's scent . 
 After lynching Sam Carter , the mob met Sylvester Carrier — Aaron 's cousin and Sarah 's son — on a road and told him to get out of town . Carrier refused , and when the mob moved on , he suggested gathering as many people as possible for protection . 
 = = = Escalation = = = 
 Despite the efforts of Sheriff Walker and mill supervisor W. H. Pillsbury to disperse the mobs , white men continued to gather . On the evening of January 4 , a mob of armed white men went to Rosewood and surrounded the house of Sarah Carrier . It was filled with approximately 15 to 25 people seeking refuge , including many children hiding upstairs under mattresses . Some of the children were in the house because they were visiting their grandmother for Christmas . They were protected by Sylvester Carrier and possibly two other men , but Carrier may have been the only one armed . He had a reputation of being proud and independent . In Rosewood , he was a formidable character , a crack shot , expert hunter , and music teacher , who was simply called " Man " . Many whites considered him arrogant and disrespectful . 
 Sylvester Carrier was reported in the New York Times saying that the attack on Fannie Taylor was an " example of what negroes could do without interference " . Whether or not he said this is debated , but a group of 20 to 30 white men , inflamed by the reported statement , went to the Carrier house . They believed that the black community in Rosewood was hiding escaped prisoner Jesse Hunter . 
 Reports conflict about who shot first , but after two members of the mob approached the house , someone opened fire . Sarah Carrier was shot in the head . Her nine @-@ year @-@ old niece at the house , Minnie Lee Langley , had witnessed Aaron Carrier taken from his house three days earlier . When Langley heard someone had been shot , she went downstairs to find her grandmother , Emma Carrier . Sylvester placed Minnie Lee in a firewood closet in front of him as he watched the front door , using the closet for cover : " He got behind me in the wood [ bin ] , and he put the gun on my shoulder , and them crackers was still shooting and going on . He put his gun on my shoulder ... told me to lean this way , and then Poly Wilkerson , he kicked the door down . When he kicked the door down , Cuz ' Syl let him have it . " 
 Several shots were exchanged : the house was riddled with bullets , but the whites did not overtake it . The standoff lasted long into the next morning , when Sarah and Sylvester Carrier were found dead inside the house ; several others were wounded , including a child who had been shot in the eye . Two white men , C. P. " Poly " Wilkerson and Henry Andrews , were killed ; Wilkerson had kicked in the front door , and Andrews was behind him . At least four whites were wounded , one possibly fatally . The remaining children in the Carrier house were spirited out the back door into the woods . They crossed dirt roads one at a time , then hid under brush until they had all gathered away from Rosewood . 
 = = = Razing Rosewood = = = 
 News of the armed standoff at the Carrier house attracted white men from all over the state to take part . Reports were carried in the St. Petersburg Independent , the Florida Times @-@ Union , the Miami Herald , and The Miami Metropolis , in versions of competing facts and overstatement . The Miami Metropolis listed 20 blacks and four whites dead and characterized the event as a " race war " . National newspapers also put the incident on the front page . The Washington Post and St. Louis Dispatch described a band of " heavily armed Negroes " and a " negro desperado " as being involved . Most of the information came from discrete messages from Sheriff Walker , mob rumors , and other embellishments to part @-@ time reporters who wired their stories to the Associated Press . Details about the armed standoff were particularly explosive . According to historian Thomas Dye , " The idea that blacks in Rosewood had taken up arms against the white race was unthinkable in the Deep South " . 
 Black newspapers understandably covered the events from a different angle . The Afro @-@ American in Baltimore highlighted the acts of African @-@ American heroism against the onslaught of " savages " . Another newspaper reported : " Two Negro women were attacked and raped between Rosewood and Sumner . The sexual lust of the brutal white <unk> satisfied , the women were strangled . " 
 The white mob burned the black churches in Rosewood . Philomena Goins ' cousin , Lee Ruth Davis , heard the bells tolling in the church as the men were inside setting it on fire . The mob also destroyed the white church in Rosewood . Many black residents fled for safety into the nearby swamps , some clothed only in their pajamas . Wilson Hall was nine years old at the time ; he later recounted his mother waking him to escape into the swamps early in the morning when it was still dark ; the lights from approaching cars of white men could be seen for miles . The Hall family walked 15 miles ( 24 km ) through swampland to the town of Gulf Hammock . The survivors recall that it was uncharacteristically cold for Florida , and people suffered when they spent several nights in raised wooded areas called hammocks to evade the mob . Some took refuge with sympathetic white families . Sam Carter 's 69 @-@ year @-@ old widow hid for two days in the swamps , then was driven by a sympathetic white mail carrier , under bags of mail , to join her family in Chiefland . 
 White men began surrounding houses , pouring kerosene on and lighting them , then shooting at those who emerged . Lexie Gordon , a light @-@ skinned 50 @-@ year @-@ old woman who was ill with typhoid fever , had sent her children into the woods . She was killed by a shotgun blast to the face when she fled from hiding underneath her home , which had been set on fire by the mob . Fannie Taylor 's brother @-@ in @-@ law claimed to be her killer . On January 5 , more whites converged on the area , forming a mob of between 200 and 300 people . Some came from out of state . Mingo Williams , who was 20 miles ( 32 km ) away near Bronson , was collecting turpentine sap by the side of the road when a car full of whites stopped and asked his name . As was custom among many residents of Levy County , both black and white , Williams used a nickname that was more prominent than his given name ; when he gave his nickname of " Lord God " , they shot him dead . 
 Sheriff Walker pleaded with news reporters covering the violence to send a message to the Alachua County Sheriff P. G. Ramsey to send assistance . <unk> of men came from Gainesville to assist Walker ; many of them had probably participated in the Klan rally earlier in the week . W. H. Pillsbury tried desperately to keep black workers in the Sumner mill , and worked with his assistant , a man named Johnson , to dissuade the white workers from joining others using extra @-@ legal violence . Armed guards sent by Sheriff Walker turned away blacks who emerged from the swamps and tried to go home . W. H. Pillsbury 's wife secretly helped smuggle people out of the area . Several white men declined to join the mobs , including the town barber who also refused to lend his gun to anyone . He said he did not want his " hands wet with blood " . 
 Governor Cary Hardee was on standby , ready to order National Guard troops in to neutralize the situation . Despite his message to the sheriff of Alachua County , Walker informed Hardee by telegram that he did not fear " further disorder " and urged the governor not to intervene . The governor 's office monitored the situation , in part because of intense Northern interest , but Hardee would not activate the National Guard without Walker 's request . Walker insisted he could handle the situation ; records show that Governor Hardee took Sheriff Walker 's word and went on a hunting trip . 
 James Carrier , Sylvester 's brother and Sarah 's son , had previously suffered a stroke and was partially paralyzed . He left the swamps and returned to Rosewood . He asked W. H. Pillsbury , the white turpentine mill supervisor , for protection ; Pillsbury locked him in a house but the mob found Carrier , and tortured him to find out if he had aided Jesse Hunter , the escaped convict . After they made Carrier dig his own grave , they fatally shot him .

 On January 6 , white train conductors John and William Bryce managed the evacuation of some black residents to Gainesville . The brothers were independently wealthy Cedar Key residents who had an affinity for trains . They knew the people in Rosewood and had traded with them regularly . As they passed the area , the <unk> slowed their train and blew the horn , picking up women and children . Fearing reprisals from mobs , they refused to pick up any black men . Many survivors boarded the train after having been hidden by white general store owner John Wright and his wife , Mary Jo . Over the next several days , other Rosewood residents fled to Wright 's house , facilitated by Sheriff Walker , who asked Wright to transport as many residents out of town as possible . 
 Lee Ruth Davis , her sister , and two brothers were hidden by the Wrights while their father hid in the woods . On the morning of Poly Wilkerson 's funeral , the Wrights left the children alone to attend . Davis and her siblings crept out of the house to hide with relatives in the nearby town of <unk> , but they were turned back for being too dangerous . The children spent the day in the woods but decided to return to the Wrights ' house . After spotting men with guns on their way back , they crept back to the Wrights , who were frantic with fear . Davis later described the experience : " I was laying that deep in water , that is where we sat all day long ... We got on our bellies and crawled . We tried to keep people from seeing us through the bushes ... We were trying to get back to Mr. Wright house . After we got all the way to his house , Mr. and Mrs. Wright were all the way out in the bushes <unk> and calling us , and when we answered , they were so glad . " Several other white residents of Sumner hid black residents of Rosewood and smuggled them out of town . Gainesville 's black community took in many of Rosewood 's refugees , waiting for them at the train station and greeting survivors as they disembarked , covered in sheets . On Sunday , January 7 , a mob of 100 to 150 whites returned to burn the remaining dozen or so structures of Rosewood . 
 = = = Response = = = 
 On January 8 , 1923 , a telegram was sent to the US Attorney General in Washington , DC , asking for an investigation ; the reply stated that the federal government had no jurisdiction and referred the matter to state officials . Many people were alarmed by the violence , and state leaders feared negative effects on the state 's tourist industry . Governor Cary Hardee appointed a special grand jury and special prosecuting attorney to investigate the outbreak in Rosewood and other incidents in Levy County . In February 1923 , the all @-@ white grand jury convened in Bronson . Over several days , they heard 25 witnesses , eight of whom were black , but found insufficient evidence to prosecute any perpetrators . The judge presiding over the case deplored the actions of the mob . 
 By the end of the week , Rosewood no longer made the front pages of major white newspapers . The Chicago Defender , the most influential black newspaper in the U.S. , reported that 19 people in Rosewood 's " race war " had died , and a soldier named Ted Cole appeared to fight the lynch mobs , then disappeared ; no confirmation of his existence after this report exists . A few editorials appeared in Florida newspapers summarizing the event . The Gainesville Daily Sun justified the actions of whites involved , writing " Let it be understood now and forever that he , whether white or black , who brutally assaults an innocent and helpless woman , shall die the death of a dog . " The Tampa Tribune , in a rare comment on the excesses of whites in the area , called it " a foul and lasting blot on the people of Levy County " . 
 Northern publications were more willing to note the breakdown of law , but many attributed it to the backward mindset in the South . The New York Call , a socialist newspaper , remarked " how astonishingly little cultural progress has been made in some parts of the world " , while the Nashville Banner compared the events in Rosewood to recent race riots in Northern cities , but characterized the entire event as " deplorable " . A three @-@ day conference in Atlanta organized by the Southern Methodist Church released a statement that similarly condemned the chaotic week in Rosewood . It concluded , " No family and no race rises higher than womanhood . Hence , the intelligence of women must be cultivated and the purity and dignity of womanhood must be protected by the maintenance of a single standard of morals for both races . " 
 Officially , the recorded death toll of the first week of January 1923 was six blacks and two whites . Historians disagree about this number . Some survivors ' stories claim there may have been up to 27 black residents killed , and assert that newspapers did not report the total number of white deaths . Minnie Lee Langley , who was in the Carrier house siege , recalls that she stepped over many white bodies on the porch when she left the house . Several eyewitnesses claim to have seen a mass grave filled with black people ; one remembers a plow brought from Cedar Key that covered 26 bodies . However , by the time authorities investigated these claims , most of the witnesses were dead , or too elderly and infirm to lead them to a site to confirm the stories . 
 Aaron Carrier was held in jail for several months in early 1923 ; he died in 1965 . James Carrier 's widow Emma was shot in the hand and the wrist and reached Gainesville by train . She never recovered , and died in 1924 . Sarah Carrier 's husband Haywood did not see the events in Rosewood . He was on a hunting trip , and discovered when he returned that his wife , brother James , and son Sylvester had all been killed and his house destroyed by a white mob . Following the shock of learning what had happened in Rosewood , Haywood rarely spoke to anyone but himself ; he sometimes wandered away from his family unclothed . His grandson , Arnett Goins , thought that he had been unhinged by grief . Haywood Carrier died a year after the massacre . Jesse Hunter , the escaped convict , was never found . Many survivors fled in different directions to other cities , and a few changed their names from fear that whites would track them down . None ever returned to live in Rosewood . 
 Fannie Taylor and her husband moved to another mill town . She was " very nervous " in her later years , until she succumbed to cancer . John Wright 's house was the only structure left standing in Rosewood . He lived in it and acted as an emissary between the county and the survivors . After they left the town , almost all of their land was sold for taxes . Mary Jo Wright died around 1931 ; John developed a problem with alcohol . He was ostracized and taunted for assisting the survivors , and rumored to keep a gun in every room of his house . He died after drinking too much one night in Cedar Key , and was buried in an unmarked grave in Sumner . The sawmill in Sumner burned down in 1925 , and the owners moved the operation to <unk> in Pasco County . Some survivors as well as participants in the mob action went to <unk> to work in the mill there . W. H. Pillsbury was among them , and he was taunted by former Sumner residents . No longer having any supervisory authority , Pillsbury was retired early by the company . He moved to Jacksonville and died in 1926 . 
 = = Culture of silence = = 
 Despite nationwide news coverage in both white and black newspapers , the incident , and the small abandoned village , slipped into oblivion . Most of the survivors scattered around Florida cities and started over with nothing . Many , including children , took on odd jobs to make ends meet . Education had to be sacrificed to earn an income . As a result , most of the Rosewood survivors took on manual labor jobs , working as maids , shoe shiners , or in citrus factories or lumber mills . 
 Although the survivors ' experiences after Rosewood were disparate , none publicly acknowledged what had happened . Robie Mortin , Sam Carter 's niece , was seven years old when her father put her on a train to Chiefland , 20 miles ( 32 km ) east of Rosewood , on January 3 , 1923 . Mortin 's father avoided the heart of Rosewood on the way to the depot that day , a decision Mortin believes saved their lives . Mortin 's father met them years later in Riviera Beach , in South Florida . None of the family ever spoke about the events in Rosewood , on order from Mortin 's grandmother : " She felt like maybe if somebody knew where we came from , they might come at us " . 
 This silence was an exception to the practice of oral history among black families . Minnie Lee Langley knew James and Emma Carrier as her parents . She kept the story from her children for 60 years : " I didn 't want them to know what I came through and I didn 't discuss it with none of them ... I just didn 't want them to know what kind of way I come up . I didn 't want them to know white folks want us out of our homes . " Decades passed before she began to trust white people . Some families spoke of Rosewood , but forbade the stories from being told : Arnett Doctor heard the story from his mother , Philomena Goins Doctor , who was with Sarah Carrier the day Fannie Taylor claimed she was assaulted , and was in the house with Sylvester Carrier . She told her children about Rosewood every Christmas . Doctor was consumed by his mother 's story ; he would bring it up to his aunts only to be dissuaded from speaking of it . 
 In 1982 , an investigative reporter named Gary Moore from the St. Petersburg Times drove from the Tampa area to Cedar Key looking for a story . When he commented to a local on the " gloomy atmosphere " of Cedar Key , and questioned why a Southern town was all @-@ white when at the start of the 20th century it had been nearly half black , the local woman replied , " I know what you 're digging for . You 're trying to get me to talk about that massacre . " Moore was hooked . He was able to convince Arnett Doctor to join him on a visit to the site , which he did without telling his mother . Moore addressed the disappearance of the incident from written or spoken history : " After a week of sensation , the weeks of January 1923 seem to have dropped completely from Florida 's consciousness , like some unmentionable skeleton in the family closet " . 
 When Philomena Goins Doctor found out what her son had done , she became enraged and threatened to disown him , shook him , then slapped him . A year later , Moore took the story to CBS ' 60 Minutes , and was the background reporter on a piece produced by Joel Bernstein and narrated by African @-@ American journalist Ed Bradley . Philomena Doctor called her family members and declared Moore 's story and Bradley 's television exposé were full of lies . A psychologist at the University of Florida later testified in state hearings that the survivors of Rosewood showed signs of posttraumatic stress disorder , made worse by the secrecy . Many years after the incident , they exhibited fear , denial , and hypervigilance about socializing with whites — which they expressed specifically regarding their children , interspersed with bouts of apathy . Despite such characteristics , survivors counted religious faith as integral to their lives following the attack in Rosewood , to keep them from becoming bitter . Michael D <unk> , who wrote a book about Rosewood , said , " [ E ] <unk> told me in their own way , in their own words , that if they allowed themselves to be bitter , to hate , it would have eaten them up . " Robie Mortin described her past this way : " I knew that something went very wrong in my life because it took a lot away from me . But I wasn 't angry or anything . " 
 The legacy of Rosewood remained in Levy County . For decades no black residents lived in Cedar Key or Sumner . Robin <unk> , the white editor of the Cedar Key Beacon , tried to place the events in an open forum by printing Moore 's story . She had been collecting anecdotes for many years , and said , " Things happened out there in the woods . There 's no doubt about that . How bad ? We don 't know ... So I said , ' Okay guys , I 'm opening the closet with the skeletons , because if we don 't learn from mistakes , we 're doomed to repeat them ' . " <unk> received notes reading , " We know how to get you and your kids . All it takes is a match " . University of Florida historian David Colburn stated , " There is a pattern of denial with the residents and their relatives about what took place , and in fact they said to us on several occasions they don 't want to talk about it , they don 't want to identify anyone involved , and there 's also a tendency to say that those who were involved were from elsewhere . " 
 In 1993 , a black couple retired to Rosewood from Washington D.C. They told The Washington Post , " When we used to have black friends down from Chiefland , they always wanted to leave before it got dark . They didn 't want to be in Rosewood after dark . We always asked , but folks wouldn 't say why . "

 Philomena Goins Doctor died in 1991 . Her son Arnett was , by that time , " obsessed " with the events in Rosewood . Although he was originally excluded from the Rosewood claims case , he was included after this was revealed by publicity . By that point , the case had been taken on a pro bono basis by one of Florida 's largest legal firms . In 1993 , the firm filed a lawsuit on behalf of Arnett Goins , Minnie Lee Langley , and other survivors against the state government for its failure to protect them and their families . 
 Survivors participated in a publicity campaign to expand attention to the case . Langley and Lee Ruth Davis appeared on The Maury Povich Show on Martin Luther King Day in 1993 . Gary Moore published another article about Rosewood in the Miami Herald on March 7 , 1993 ; he had to negotiate with the newspaper 's editors for about a year to publish it . At first they were skeptical that the incident had taken place , and secondly , reporter Lori <unk> of the Miami Herald had reported on the first stage of what proved in December 1992 to be a deceptive claims case , with most of the survivors excluded . " If something like that really happened , we figured , it would be all over the history books " , an editor wrote . 
 Arnett Doctor told the story of Rosewood to print and television reporters from all over the world . He raised the number of historic residents in Rosewood , as well as the number who died at the Carrier house siege ; he exaggerated the town 's contemporary importance by comparing it to Atlanta , Georgia as a cultural center . Doctor wanted to keep Rosewood in the news ; his accounts were printed with few changes . According to historian Thomas Dye , Doctor 's " forceful addresses to groups across the state , including the NAACP , together with his many articulate and heart @-@ rending television appearances , placed intense pressure on the legislature ... to do something about Rosewood " . In December 1996 , Doctor told a meeting at Jacksonville Beach that 30 women and children had been buried alive at Rosewood , and that his facts had been confirmed by journalist Gary Moore . He was embarrassed to learn that Moore was in the audience . As the Holland & Knight law firm continued the claims case , they represented 13 survivors , people who had lived in Rosewood at the time of the 1923 violence , in the claim to the legislature . 
 The lawsuit missed the filing deadline of January 1 , 1993 . The speaker of the Florida House of Representatives commissioned a group to research and provide a report by which the equitable claim bill could be evaluated . It took them nearly a year to do the research , including interviews , and writing . On December 22 , 1993 , historians from Florida State University , Florida A & M University , and the University of Florida delivered a 100 @-@ page report ( with 400 pages of attached documentation ) on the Rosewood massacre . It was based on available primary documents , and interviews mostly with black survivors of the incident . Due to the media attention received by residents of Cedar Key and Sumner following filing of the claim by survivors , white participants were discouraged from offering interviews to the historians . The report used a taped description of the events by Jason <unk> , a Cedar Key resident who had since died , and an interview with Ernest Parham , who was in high school in 1923 and happened upon the lynching of Sam Carter . Parham said he had never spoken of the incident because he was never asked . The report was titled " Documented History of the Incident which <unk> at Rosewood , Florida in January 1923 " . Gary Moore , the investigative journalist who wrote the 1982 story in The St. Petersburg Times that reopened the Rosewood case , criticized demonstrable errors in the report . The commissioned group retracted the most serious of these , without public discussion . They delivered the final report to the Florida Board of Regents and it became part of the legislative record . 
 = = = Rosewood victims v. the State of Florida = = = 
 Florida 's consideration of a bill to compensate victims of racial violence was the first by any U.S. state . Opponents argued that the bill set a dangerous precedent and put the onus of paying survivors and descendants on Floridians who had nothing to do with the incident in Rosewood . James Peters , who represented the State of Florida , argued that the statute of limitations applied because the law enforcement officials named in the lawsuit — Sheriff Walker and Governor Hardee — had died many years before . He also called into question the shortcomings of the report : although the historians were instructed not to write it with compensation in mind , they offered conclusions about the actions of Sheriff Walker and Governor Hardee . The report was based on investigations led by historians as opposed to legal experts ; they relied in cases on information that was hearsay from witnesses who had since died . Critics thought that some of the report 's writers asked leading questions in their interviews . 
 Even legislators who agreed with the sentiment of the bill asserted that the events in Rosewood were typical of the era . One survivor interviewed by Gary Moore said that to single out Rosewood as an exception , as if the entire world was not a Rosewood , would be " vile " . Florida Representatives Al Lawson and Miguel De Grandy argued that , unlike Native Americans or slaves who had suffered atrocities at the hands of whites , the residents of Rosewood were tax @-@ paying , self @-@ sufficient citizens who deserved the protection of local and state law enforcement . While lynchings of individual blacks by mobs around the same time tended to be spontaneous and quickly concluded , the incident at Rosewood was prolonged over a period of several days . Some legislators began to receive hate mail , including some claiming to be from Ku Klux Klan members . One legislator remarked that his office received an unprecedented response to the bill , with a proportion of ten constituents to one opposing it . 
 In 1994 , the state legislature held a hearing to discuss the merits of the bill . Lee Ruth Davis died a few months before testimony began , but Minnie Lee Langley , Arnett Goins , Wilson Hall , Willie Evans , and several descendants from Rosewood testified . Other witnesses were a clinical psychologist from the University of Florida , who testified that survivors had suffered post @-@ traumatic stress , and experts who offered testimony about the scale of property damages . Langley spoke first ; the hearing room was packed with journalists and onlookers who were reportedly mesmerized by her statement . Ernest Parham also testified about what he saw . When asked specifically when he was contacted by law enforcement regarding the death of Sam Carter , Parham replied that he had been contacted for the first time on Carter 's death two weeks before testifying . The coroner 's inquest for Sam Carter had taken place the day after he was shot in January 1923 ; he concluded that Carter had been killed " by Unknown Party " . 
 After hearing all the evidence , the Special Master Richard <unk> , who presided over the testimony for the Florida Legislature , declared that the state had a " moral obligation " to make restitution to the former residents of Rosewood . He said , " I truly don 't think they cared about compensation . I think they simply wanted the truth to be known about what happened to them ... whether they got fifty cents or a hundred and fifty million dollars . It didn 't matter . " 
 Black and Hispanic legislators in Florida took on the Rosewood compensation bill as a cause , and refused to support Governor Lawton Chiles ' healthcare plan until he put pressure on House Democrats to vote for the bill . Chiles was offended , as he had supported the compensation bill from its early days , and the legislative caucuses had previously promised their support for his healthcare plan . The legislature passed the bill , and Governor Chiles signed the Rosewood Compensation Bill , a $ 2 @.@ 1 million package to compensate survivors and their descendants . Seven survivors and their family members were present at the signing to hear Chiles say , 
 Because of the strength and commitment of these survivors and their families , the long silence has finally been broken and the shadow has been lifted ... Instead of being forgotten , because of their testimony , the Rosewood story is known across our state and across our nation . This legislation assures that the tragedy of Rosewood will never be forgotten by the generations to come . 
 Originally , the compensation total offered to survivors was $ 7 million , which aroused controversy . The legislature eventually settled on $ 1 @.@ 5 million : this would enable payment of $ 150 @,@ 000 to each person who could prove he or she lived in Rosewood during 1923 , and provide a $ 500 @,@ 000 pool for people who could apply for the funds after demonstrating that they had an ancestor who owned property in Rosewood during the same time . The four survivors who testified automatically qualified ; four others had to apply . More than 400 applications were received from around the world . 
 Robie Mortin came forward as a survivor during this time ; she was the only one added to the list who could prove she lived in Rosewood in 1923 , totaling nine survivors who were compensated . Gaining compensation changed some families , whose members began to fight among themselves . Some descendants refused it , while others went into hiding to avoid the press of friends and relatives who came asking for handouts . Some descendants , after dividing the funds among siblings , received not much more than $ 100 each . Later , the Florida Department of Education set up the Rosewood Family Scholarship Fund for Rosewood descendants and ethnic minorities .

 The Rosewood massacre , the ensuing silence , and the compensation hearing were the subject of the 1996 book Like Judgment Day : The Ruin and Redemption of a Town Called Rosewood by Michael D <unk> . It won the Lillian Smith Book Award , bestowed by the University of Georgia Libraries and the Southern Regional Council , to authors who highlight racial and social inequality in their works . 
 The dramatic feature film Rosewood ( 1997 ) , directed by John Singleton , was based on these historic events . Minnie Lee Langley served as a source for the set designers , and Arnett Doctor was hired as a consultant . <unk> forms of the towns of Rosewood and Sumner were built in Central Florida , far away from Levy County . The film version , written by screenwriter Gregory Poirier , created a character named Mann , who enters Rosewood as a type of reluctant Western @-@ style hero . Composites of historic figures were used as characters , and the film offers the possibility of a happy ending . E.R. Shipp in The New York Times suggests that Singleton 's youth and his background in California contributed to his willingness to take on the story of Rosewood . She notes Singleton 's rejection of the image of blacks as victims and portrayal of " an idyllic past in which black families are intact , loving and prosperous , and a black superhero who changes the course of history when he escapes the noose , takes on the mob with double @-@ barreled ferocity and saves many women and children from death " . Singleton has offered his view : " I had a very deep — I wouldn 't call it fear — but a deep contempt for the South because I felt that so much of the horror and evil that black people have faced in this country is rooted here ... So in some ways this is my way of dealing with the whole thing . " 
 Reception to the film was mixed . Shipp commented on Singleton 's creating a fictional account of Rosewood events , saying that the film " assumes a lot and then makes up a lot more " . The film version alludes to many more deaths than the highest counts by eyewitnesses . Gary Moore believes that creating an outside character who inspires the citizens of Rosewood to fight back condescends to survivors , and he criticized the inflated death toll specifically , saying the film was " an interesting experience in illusion " . On the other hand , in 2001 Stanley Crouch of The New York Times described Rosewood as Singleton 's finest work , writing , " Never in the history of American film had Southern racist hysteria been shown so clearly . Color , class and sex were woven together on a level that Faulkner would have appreciated . "

 The State of Florida declared Rosewood a Florida Heritage Landmark in 2004 and subsequently erected a historical marker on State Road 24 that names the victims and describes the community 's destruction . Scattered structures remain within the community , including a church , a business , and a few homes , notably John Wright 's . Robie Mortin , the last survivor , died on June 12 , 2010 at age 94 after a brief illness . 
 Rosewood descendants formed the Rosewood Heritage Foundation and the Real Rosewood Foundation to educate people in Florida and all over the world . The Rosewood Heritage Foundation created a traveling exhibit that tours internationally to share the history of Rosewood and the attacks ; a permanent display is housed in the library of Bethune @-@ Cookman University in Daytona Beach . The Real Rosewood Foundation presents a variety of humanitarian awards to people in Central Florida who help preserve Rosewood 's history . The organization also recognized Rosewood residents who protected blacks during the attacks by presenting an Unsung Heroes Award to the descendants of Sheriff Robert Walker , John Bryce , and William Bryce . Lizzie Jenkins , executive director of the Real Rosewood Foundation and niece of the Rosewood schoolteacher , explained her interest in keeping Rosewood 's legacy current : 
 It has been a struggle telling this story over the years , because a lot of people don 't want to hear about this kind of history . People don 't relate to it , or just don 't want to hear about it . But Mama told me to keep it alive , so I keep telling it ... It 's a sad story , but it 's one I think everyone needs to hear . 
 = Dark Fantasy ( song ) = 
 " Dark Fantasy " is a song by American hip hop recording artist and producer Kanye West from his fifth studio album , My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy ( 2010 ) . The song serves as the opening track of the album , and was written by West , Ernest Wilson , Jeff Bhasker , Mike Dean and Robert Diggs . It features an opening narrative delivered by rapper Nicki Minaj , and singers Teyana Taylor and Justin Vernon contribute to the song 's hook and provide background vocals . The track is built around a sample of " In High Places " by Mike Oldfield . The song introduces several of the themes presented on the album and features numerous pop culture references , a gospel @-@ inspired production style , and piano @-@ driven composition . The song received acclaim from music critics , who praised the song as a strong opener to My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy , complimenting West 's vocal delivery and the song 's production . 
 Despite not being released as a single , the hype generated by the release of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy caused the song to enter the Billboard Hot 100 at position 60 . It was the opening song of West 's 2011 setlist at the Coachella Music Festival , and was performed with Taylor at the ' Vevo Presents GOOD Music ' musical venue . " Dark Fantasy " was utilized during the opening sequence of West 's short film Runaway , during an extended scene with West driving down an atmospheric forest .

 Like the majority of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy , the song was recorded in Oahu , Hawaii . Following several media controversies , West decided to record his next album in a reclusive manner only working with artists he considered himself familiar with . The song features vocals delivered by singer Teyana Taylor , a musician who initially met West at his Glow in the Dark Tour tour in 2007 . West was an admirer of her fashion sense , and the two frequently talked about clothing and designing , to the point when they eventually became friends . West called Taylor down to his recording studio in Hawaii under the pretense of checking out some pieces of clothing designed by Pierre Balmain . While the initial reason for her being there was to look at some clothing for him , she was determined to appear on the album . While at the studio , she purposely hummed loud enough for West to hear her . West was impressed by her singing ability and by the fact she was signed to producer Pharrell Williams , and asked her to do backing vocals on the album . On the recording process of the song , she commented : 
 " So then he tells me to do ' Dark Fantasy . ' At the time it was pretty empty , just verses . He put me in another room by myself and said , ' Go . ' I came back with a whole intro and chorus . I did all the scratches and the cuts myself with my voice . That ’ s not a DJ thing when you hear my voice go like that . I was so nervous when I played it for Kanye . I hadn ’ t been in the studio for so long . I was so excited to be trying out for that song . Rihanna was there . " 
 According to Taylor , when the song was being recorded , it was three hours before the album 's deadline when it had to be turned into the record company . West was so impressed with her performance that he signed her to his label GOOD Music , because of issues she was facing with her current label Star Trak Entertainment . Justin Vernon of the group Bon Iver appears on backing vocals of the track and is the first voice heard on the album . West was a fan of Bon Iver 's album For Emma , Forever Ago and invited him down to Hawaii to record with him . While working there , the two became friends and reportedly produced 10 songs during their sessions together . Vernon described the process as highly artistic in nature , stating that the fourteen @-@ hour day recording schedule allowed for a lot of fun and creativity . 
 The song features production by RZA of the hip @-@ hop group Wu @-@ Tang Clan , who commented that " Dark Fantasy " was one of the many compositions that he and West collaborated on . According to him , West had a " stack of beats " and that he tried to be as productive as possible with so much material already recorded . The style of composition is deeply influenced by producer RZA , who introduces his " bring @-@ the @-@ ruckus " aesthetic to the song production . Nicki Minaj was asked to open the song with a spoken word introduction , a favor she was excited to perform because she was a fan of Jay @-@ Z , a rapper who West was recording with at the time . Minaj described both Jay @-@ Z and West as " icons " , and stated that she was blessed to be working with them . 
 Producer No I.D. spoke about the history of the beat , and noted that it was offered to both Drake and Jay @-@ Z before West finally decided to use it himself . According to him , producers RZA and Pete Rock had already recorded certain portions of the song , and that him and West recorded the chorus parts . Following that , he mused " then Nicki did the intro and it went crazy . That ’ s one of my favorite records , just because of all the emotions that came with it . ” 
 = = Composition = = 
 The song is introduced with a narrative by Minaj , speaking in an English accent , that serves as a retelling of writer Roald Dahl 's poetic rework of " Cinderella " . West begins his verse with the refrain " I fantasized ’ bout this back in Chicago " . It introduces themes referenced on the majority of My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy , including comments on decadence and hedonism , with West musing how " the plan was to drink until the pain was over / but what ’ s worse , the pain or the hangover ? " . His lyrics on the track contain numerous musical and cultural references , including those to the song " Mercy Mercy Me ( The Ecology ) " , the Lamborghini Murciélago sports car , rapper Nas , fashion designer Phoebe Philo , short story " The Legend of Sleepy Hollow " , the band the Kings Of Leon and their song " Sex on Fire " , singers Celine Dion and Leona Lewis , and television character Steve Urkel . The song contains the line " too many <unk> on your team / that 's why your wins low " , a double entendre . The " <unk> " were the family Urkel lived with on the show Family Matters , with the alternative meaning touching upon how his opponents ' " wins are low " . The chorus contains the line " can we get much higher ? " , another inquiry that is brought up during much of the proceeding album . The song samples a portion of " In High Places " by Mike Oldfield , a pop rock song from 1983 from the album Crises . 
 West raps in a highly melodic manner , almost singing some of his verses , over the brooding production style . The production style has been defined as having several similarities with West 's prior composition styles . AbsolutePunk 's Drew Beringer stated felt that the song sounded like West was " sampling his own source material " on the song , and felt that West embraced a " baroque instrumentation " on the track .

 " Dark Fantasy " received acclaim by critics . The Washington Post 's Chris Richards described the song as having " mutant gospel crescendos " and called it epic in nature . MTV News praised the delivery of Minaj 's verse , calling it structured like a nursery rhyme , musing that it " sets the tone for the song ( which is intense and hallucinatory ) and the album " . Rolling Stone writer Rob Sheffield praising the lyricism , describing it as witty , and wrote " in ' Dark Fantasy , ' West rhymes " mercy , mercy me , that Murcielago " with " diablo , " " bravado " and " My chick in that new Phoebe Philo / So much head , I woke up in Sleepy Hollow . It 's some genius stuff . " David Amidon of PopMatters felt that West 's vocals were " layered a baker ’ s dozen different ways " and described the production as synthetic in nature . 
 Dan Vidal of URB stated that he enjoyed Minaj 's verse , describing it as a " pseudo @-@ cockney @-@ accented opening narration " and praised the song 's arrangement as " spine @-@ tingling " . David Browne of Time wrote " tracks like ' Dark Fantasy ' and ' So Appalled ' are built on rumbling tanks of pianos and strings that sound as if West is marching into the apocalypse . " Andrew Martin of Prefix Magazine stated that the song restored his admiration for West , and that the track lived up to the hype behind it , writing " most of it is rather epic and damn good , especially this track with its classic RZA production and assistance from No I.D .. " J. Tinsley of The Smoking Section commented that the song served as a successful opener , viewing it as a " boisterous firestarter combining sharp lyrics , a spurious Nicki Minaj English accent and an enormous chorus . " Chris Martins of Spin complimented West 's lyricism and use of double <unk> , and mused that the track was the album 's " beyond luxe opener " . Jonah Weiner Slate commented that West pulled off an impressive balancing act , and cited the song as an example of " his marvelous , hungry ear " . Andrew Barber of Complex compared the impact of the beat to that of a cannon , calling the production team of the song a " dream team " , describing the track as powerful in nature .

 At the ' Vevo Presents GOOD Music ' musical presentation , the song was performed by both West and Taylor . The performance began with West 's silhouette pressed against a glowing background , dressed in all black . Taylor joined the performance and sang her portion of the song . During his set at the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival , West performed " Dark Fantasy " as the opening track . 
 The song was also featured as the opening track in Runaway , a 35 @-@ minute music video directed by West set to music from My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy . The scene which the track is played during features West driving his MTX Tatra V8 through the forest when he crashes into a meteorite , which according to GQ , paralleled West 's car accident that was the inspiration for " Through the Wire " . The song was used in advertisements for the film The Hangover Part II . Taylor commented that she heard the song performed at a basketball game she was attending , and saw the trailer for Hangover II which featured the song . She reported that she was very excited to see that the song was becoming popular . 
 Most notably , the song is featured during the farewell montage at the climax of The Hangover Part III , particularly the verse " The plan was to drink until the pain over , but what 's worse the pain or the hangover ? " as it coincidentally relates to the story arc of the trilogy .

 = SMS Zähringen = 
 SMS Zähringen ( " His Majesty 's Ship Zähringen " ) was third ship of the Wittelsbach class of pre @-@ dreadnought battleships of the German Imperial Navy . Laid down in 1899 at the Germaniawerft shipyard in Kiel , she was launched on 12 June 1901 and commissioned on 25 October 1902 . Her sisters were Wittelsbach , Wettin , Schwaben and Mecklenburg ; they were the first capital ships built under the Navy Law of 1898 , brought about by Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz . 
 Zähringen saw active duty in the I Squadron of the German fleet for the majority of her career . The ship was rapidly superseded by new " all @-@ big @-@ gun " warships , however , and as a result served for less than eight years before being decommissioned on 21 September 1910 . After the start of World War I in August 1914 , Zähringen was brought back to active duty in the IV Battle Squadron . The ship saw limited duty in the Baltic Sea against Russian forces , though the threat from British submarines forced the ship to withdraw by 1916 . 
 Zähringen was converted into a target ship in 1917 for the remainder of the war . In the mid @-@ 1920s , Zähringen was heavily reconstructed and equipped for use as a radio @-@ controlled target ship . She served in this capacity until 1944 , when she was sunk in Gotenhafen by British bombers during World War II . The retreating Germans raised the ship and moved it to the harbor mouth where they scuttled it to block the port . Zähringen was broken up in situ in 1949 – 50 . 
 = = Description = = 
 Zähringen was 126 @.@ 8 m ( 416 ft 0 in ) long overall and had a beam of 22 @.@ 8 m ( 74 ft 10 in ) and a draft of 7 @.@ 95 m ( 26 ft 1 in ) forward . The ship was powered by three 3 @-@ cylinder vertical triple expansion engines that drove three screws . Steam was provided by six naval and six cylindrical coal @-@ fired boilers . Zähringen 's powerplant was rated at 14 @,@ 000 metric horsepower ( 13 @,@ 808 ihp ; 10 @,@ 297 kW ) , which generated a top speed of 18 knots ( 33 km / h ; 21 mph ) . She had a crew of 30 officers and 650 enlisted men . 
 Zähringen 's armament consisted of a main battery of four 24 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) SK L / 40 guns in twin gun turrets , one fore and one aft of the central superstructure . Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 inch ) SK L / 40 guns and twelve 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 45 in ) SK L / 30 quick @-@ firing guns . The armament suite was rounded out with six 45 cm ( 18 in ) torpedo tubes , all submerged in the hull ; one was in the bow , one in the stern , and the other four were on the broadside . Her armored belt was 225 millimeters ( 8 @.@ 9 in ) thick in the central portion that protected her magazines and machinery spaces , and the deck was 50 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 in ) thick . The main battery turrets had 250 mm ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) of armor plating . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Zähringen 's keel was laid on 21 November 1899 , at Friedrich Krupp 's Germaniawerft dockyard in Kiel . She was ordered under the contract name " E " , as a new unit for the fleet . The Wittelsbach class was the first battleship class built under the terms of the Navy Law of 1898 , the chief proponent of which was Admiral Alfred von Tirpitz . Zähringen was launched on 12 June 1901 , with her launching speech given by Frederick I , Grand Duke of Baden and head of the House of Zähringen ; his wife , Grand Duchess Louise , christened the ship . Zähringen was commissioned on 25 October 1902 , and began her sea trials , which lasted until 10 February 1903 . She thereafter replaced the battleship Brandenburg in the I Squadron of the Active Fleet . 
 In 1905 the German fleet was reorganized into two squadrons of battleships . Zähringen was assigned to the I Division of I Squadron , alongside her sisters Wettin and Wittelsbach . The German fleet at that time consisted of another three @-@ ship division in the I Squadron and 2 three @-@ ship divisions in the II Squadron . This was supported by a reconnaissance division , composed of two armored cruisers and six protected cruisers . 
 The Deutschland @-@ class battleships — the most powerful battleships yet built in Germany — were beginning to enter service by 1907 . This provided the Navy with enough ships to form two full battle squadrons of eight ships each . The fleet was then renamed the Hochseeflotte ( High Seas Fleet ) . On 21 September 1910 , Zähringen was decommissioned and her crew was transferred to the new dreadnought Rheinland , which had recently been completed . In 1912 , Zähringen and her sisters were recommissioned as the III Squadron of the High Seas Fleet to augment the forces available for the annual summer fleet maneuvers in the North Sea . The exercises began on 2 September and were conducted in the area between Wilhelmshaven , Helgoland , and Cuxhaven . While on maneuvers southwest of Helgoland on 14 September 1912 , Zähringen accidentally rammed the torpedo boat <unk> . The torpedo boat was cut in half and quickly sank ; six men drowned and a seventh died after being pulled from the sea . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 By 1914 , Zähringen and her sisters were removed from active service and placed in the reserve squadron . However , after the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , Zähringen and the rest of her class were mobilized to serve in the IV Battle Squadron , under the command of Vice Admiral Ehrhard Schmidt . Starting on 3 September , the IV Squadron , assisted by the armored cruiser Blücher , conducted a sweep into the Baltic . The operation lasted until 9 September and failed to bring Russian naval units to battle . In May 1915 , IV Squadron , including Zähringen , was transferred to support the German Army in the Baltic Sea area . Zähringen and her sisters were then based in Kiel . 
 On 6 May , the IV Squadron ships were tasked with providing support to the assault on Libau . Zähringen and the other ships stood off Gotland in order to intercept any Russian cruisers that might try to intervene in the landings , which the Russians did not attempt . On 10 May , after the invasion force had entered Libau , the British submarines HMS E1 and HMS E9 spotted the IV Squadron , but were too far away to make an attack . Zähringen and her sisters were not included in the German fleet that assaulted the Gulf of Riga in August 1915 , due to the scarcity of escorts . The increasingly active British submarines forced the Germans to employ more destroyers to protect the capital ships . 
 By 1916 , the increasing threat from British submarines in the Baltic convinced the German navy to withdraw the elderly Wittelsbach @-@ class ships from active service . Zähringen was initially used as a training ship in Kiel . In 1917 , the ship was used to train stokers but then became a target ship . 
 = = = Reichsmarine and Kriegsmarine = = = 
 As of April 1919 , Zähringen lay in the harbor in Danzig ; the ship had been decommissioned but retained its armament . According to Article 181 of the Treaty of Versailles , Zähringen and her sisters were to be demilitarized . This would permit the newly reorganized Reichsmarine to retain the vessels for auxiliary purposes . Zähringen was therefore stricken from the navy list on 11 March 1920 and disarmed . She was then used as a hulk in Wilhelmshaven until 1926 . 
 In 1927 – 28 , the Reichsmarine rebuilt the ship as a radio @-@ controlled target vessel . The ship had its engine system overhauled ; the three @-@ shaft arrangement was replaced by a pair of 3 @-@ cylinder , vertical triple expansion engines . These were supplied with steam by two naval oil @-@ fired , water @-@ tube boilers . The system was designed to be operated remotely via wireless telegraph . The new propulsion system provided a top speed of 13 @.@ 5 knots ( 25 @.@ 0 km / h ; 15 @.@ 5 mph ) . The superstructure was also cut down and the hull was filled with cork . When the conversion was completed , Zähringen displaced 11 @,@ 800 metric tons ( 11 @,@ 600 long tons ) . While not in use as a target , the ship was manned by a crew of 67 . She served as a target vessel for the Reichsmarine and then the Kriegsmarine , together with the old battleship Hessen . 
 On 18 December 1944 , the old ship was hit by bombs during an air raid on Gotenhafen and sank in shallow water . She was temporarily refloated and towed to the harbor entrance , where she was scuttled to block the port on 26 March 1945 . The wreck was broken up in situ starting in 1949 ; work lasted until 1950 . 
 = Stealth game = 
 A stealth game is a type of video game that tasks the player with using stealth to avoid or overcome antagonists . Games in the genre typically allow the player to remain undetected by hiding , using disguises , and / or avoiding noise . Some games allow the player to choose between a stealthy approach or directly attacking antagonists , perhaps rewarding the player for greater levels of stealth . The genre has employed espionage , counter @-@ terrorism and rogue themes , with protagonists who have been identified as special forces operatives , spies , thieves , ninjas , and assassins . Some games have also combined stealth elements with other genres , such as first @-@ person shooters and even platformers . 
 Some of the early games emphasizing stealth include Manbiki Shounen ( 1979 ) , Lupin III ( 1980 ) , 005 ( 1981 ) , Castle Wolfenstein ( 1981 ) , Infiltrator ( 1986 ) , Metal Gear ( 1987 ) , and Metal Gear 2 : Solid Snake ( 1990 ) . The genre became popular in 1998 , with the mainstream success of Metal Gear Solid as well as Tenchu : Stealth Assassins and Thief : The Dark Project . Tenchu was the first 3D game in the genre , while Metal Gear Solid , released some months later , transformed the relatively obscure Metal Gear series into a highly acclaimed , profitable franchise with numerous sequels , while Thief pioneered 3D stealth games on the PC . These games were followed by other stealth series , such as Hitman and Splinter Cell . Later games in the genre have allowed the player to choose between , or combine , stealth tactics and direct confrontation . 
 = = Definition = = 
 Unlike most action games , stealth games challenge the player to avoid alerting enemies altogether . The core gameplay elements of the modern stealth game are to avoid combat , minimize noise , and strike enemies from the shadows . Completing objectives without being detected by any enemy , sometimes referred to as " ghosting " is a common approach to stealth games . Avoiding detection may be the only way to successfully complete a game , but there are usually multiple ways to achieve a goal with different pathways or styles of play . Players can hide behind objects or in shadows , and can strike or run past an enemy when the enemy is facing the other way . If the player attracts the attention of enemies , they usually must hide and wait until the enemies abandon their search . Thus , planning becomes important , as does trial @-@ and @-@ error . However , some stealth games put more emphasis on physical combat skill when the player is spotted . Some games offer a choice between killing or merely knocking out an enemy . When ghosting is optional , or even not well @-@ supported by a game , players may still attempt to avoid combat for moral reasons or as a demonstration of skill . 
 = = Game design = = 
 When hiding in the dark is a gameplay element , light and shadow become important parts of the level design . Usually the player is able to disable certain light sources . Stealth games also emphasize the audio design when players must be able to hear the subtle sound effects that may alert enemies to their actions ; noise will often vary as the player walks on different surfaces such as wood or metal . Players who move recklessly will make more noise and attract more attention . 
 In order for a game to include stealth gameplay , the knowledge of the artificial intelligence ( AI ) must be restricted to make it ignorant to parts of the game world . The AI in stealth games takes into specific consideration the enemies ' reactions to the effects of the player 's actions , such as turning off the lights , as opposed to merely reacting to the player directly . Enemies typically have a line of sight which the player can avoid by hiding behind objects , staying in the shadows or moving while the enemy is facing another direction . Enemies can also typically detect when the player touches them or moves within a small , fixed distance . Overall , stealth games vary in what player actions the AI will perceive and react to , with more recent games offering a wider range of enemy reactions . Often , the AI 's movements are predictable and regular , allowing the player to devise a strategy to overcome his adversaries . Players are often given limited methods of engaging opponents directly in stealth games , either by restricting the player to ineffective or non @-@ lethal weapons , equipping adversaries with far superior equipment and numbers , or providing the player with a limited amount of health that makes most combat scenarios extremely dangerous . Stealth games sometimes overlap with the survival horror genre , in which players are forced to hide from and evade supernatural or occasionally mundane enemies as they attempt to track down the player . Examples of hybrid stealth / horror games include Amnesia : The Dark Descent , <unk> , and the Penumbra video game series . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early developments : 1979 – 1997 = = = 
 The first stealth game was Manbiki Shounen ( Shoplifting Boy ) , a PET 2001 personal computer game developed by Hiroshi Suzuki , a 19 year @-@ old Tokyo University student , in October 1979 , and released in November 1979 . Inspired by a 7 / 11 store near his university , the game involves a boy entering a convenience store and attempting to shoplift by stealing " $ " symbols , while avoiding the line @-@ of @-@ sight detection of the owner ; if caught , the player is led away by the police . He presented the game to Space Invaders developer Taito , which used it as inspiration for their similar stealth arcade game , Lupin III ( based on the manga and anime of the same name ) , released in April 1980 . Suzuki developed a Manbiki Shounen sequel , Manbiki Shoujo ( Shoplifting Girl ) , released in November 1980 for the PET 2001 , requiring an installed PCG ( Programmable Character Generator ) module for improved tile map graphics and more realistic movement . The game also featured speech synthesis and joystick support . Manbiki Shounen was later ported to the PC @-@ 6001 in July 1982 . The game was then ported to the FM @-@ 7 in 1983 . 
 In 1981 , Sega released an arcade game called 005 in which the player 's mission is to take a briefcase of secret documents to a waiting helicopter while avoiding enemy flashlights and use boxes as hiding spots . 005 held the Guinness World Record for being the first stealth game . Castle Wolfenstein , originally available on the Apple II in 1981 , also employed stealth elements as a focus of the gameplay . Players were charged with traversing the levels of Castle Wolfenstein , stealing secret plans and escaping . Players could acquire uniforms to disguise themselves and walk by guards undetected . Beyond Castle Wolfenstein , released in 1984 , included some additions to its predecessor , such as a dagger for close @-@ range kills and a greater emphasis on disguising in enemy <unk> id Software 's technically updated 1992 remake Wolfenstein 3D was originally going to feature some of the original 's stealth gameplay , such as body hiding , but this was cut to make the game faster paced . This Wolfenstein game would ironically pave the way for quite a few later 3D action games , specifically first @-@ person shooters . 
 Mindscape 's Infiltrator , released in 1986 , combined a flight simulator with a stealth @-@ based " ground mission " . In this ground mission , the protagonist attempts to sneak into enemy territory using false IDs to avoid detection and knock @-@ out gas to incapacitate enemies . The goal of this mission is to photograph secret documents while avoiding alarms . 
 Hideo Kojima 's Metal Gear , released in 1987 for the MSX2 and the Nintendo Entertainment System in 1988 , utilized stealth elements within an action @-@ adventure framework , and was the first mainstream stealth game to be released on consoles . Since the MSX2 was not available in North America , only the NES version was released there . Metal Gear placed a greater emphasis on stealth than other games of its time , with the player character Solid Snake beginning without any weapons ( requiring him to avoid confrontation until weapons are found ) and having limited ammunition for each weapon . Enemies are able to see Snake from a distance ( using a line @-@ of @-@ sight mechanic ) and hear gunshots from non @-@ silenced weapons ; security cameras and sensors are placed at various locations , and a security alarm sounds whenever Snake is spotted and causes all enemies on screen to chase him . Snake could also disguise himself in enemy uniform or a cardboard box , and use his fists to fight enemies . 
 The sequel Metal Gear 2 : Solid Snake was released in 1990 for the MSX2 . It further evolved the stealth gameplay of its predecessor and introduced most of the gameplay elements present in Metal Gear Solid , including the three @-@ dimensional element of height , allowing players to crouch and crawl into hiding spots and air ducts and underneath desks . The player could also distract guards by knocking on surfaces and use a radar to plan ahead . The enemies had improved AI , including a 45 @-@ degree field of vision , turning their heads left and right to see diagonally , the detection of various different noises , being able to move from screen to screen ( they were limited to a single screen in earlier games ) , and a three @-@ phase security alarm ( where reinforcements are called in to chase the intruder , then remain on the lookout for some time after losing sight of the intruder , and then leave the area ) . The game also had a complex storyline and improved graphics . 
 = = = Establishing a genre : 1998 – 2002 = = = 
 Although stealth gameplay had appeared in several games in the 1980s and 1990s , 1998 is seen as a turning point in gaming history because of the release of Metal Gear Solid , Tenchu : Stealth Assassins , and Thief : The Dark Project . The ninja @-@ themed game Tenchu : Stealth Assassins was released several months before Metal Gear Solid , making it the first 3D stealth based @-@ game . The highly anticipated Metal Gear Solid transformed its modestly successful franchise into a large mainstream success . The increased power of the PlayStation console over previous platforms allowed for greater immersion in terms of both story and game environment . Metal Gear Solid has been credited with popularizing the stealth genre . Thief : The Dark Project is also credited as a pioneer of the genre . It was the first stealth game using the first @-@ person perspective , dubbed a " first @-@ person sneaker " , or " sneak @-@ em @-@ up " , and the first to use darkness and shadows as the mode of concealment . Another of Thief 's most noteworthy contributions to the genre was the heavy use of audio cues and ambiance to determine the player 's level of stealth and establish a tense , foreboding atmosphere . 
 With further releases , many games in the genre have drifted towards action by allowing the option of direct confrontations . The Hitman series , the first installment of which was released in 2000 , allowed this play style , but rewarded the player for stealthy and elaborate assassination of antagonists . Hitman : Codename 47 was also the first 3D game to employ the genre 's device of disguises . No One Lives Forever , an espionage themed parody also released in 2000 , again allowed the player to combine or choose between stealth and overt violence . In 2000 , the first @-@ person action role @-@ playing game Deus Ex also incorporated stealth elements in its gameplay . A USA Today reviewer found " At the easiest difficulty setting , your character is pureed again and again by an onslaught of human and robotic terrorists until you learn the value of stealth . " 
 The acclaimed Metal Gear series continued with Metal Gear Solid 2 : Sons of Liberty ( PlayStation 2 ; 2001 ) which further evolved the stealth gameplay . It featured an array of new abilities , including " leaping over and hanging off of railings , opening and hiding in storage lockers , " and sneaking up behind enemies to " hold them at gunpoint for items and ammunition . " Metal Gear Solid 2 : Sons of Liberty became the genre 's best selling game with 7 million in sales , followed by Metal Gear Solid with 6 million in sales . 
 = = = Later developments : 2002 – present = = = 
 Due to the success of Metal Gear Solid , and to an extent Tenchu and Thief , stealth elements have become increasingly incorporated by a wide range of video games , with numerous action games since then using stealth elements in some way or another . 2002 saw the first installment of the Tom Clancy licensed Splinter Cell series , an attempt at a more realistic game in the vein of Metal Gear . As with Metal Gear , if the player is discovered in Splinter Cell , the guards will often raise a general alarm . This can cause a difficulty spike or even result in automatic mission failure . Splinter Cell was notable for its state of the art graphics , including dynamic lighting and shadows . These effects not only contributed to the atmosphere of the game , but dynamically affected in which areas the player could hide . The 2004 sequel , Tom Clancy 's Splinter Cell : Pandora Tomorrow , added a multiplayer component to the stealth genre . 
 As the genre developed and progressed , stealth gameplay was combined with other genres . Sly Cooper , a cel @-@ shaded game released in 2002 , was a " stealth platformer " , while 2003 's Siren combined the survival horror genre with the stealth genre . In the same year , Manhunt employed a snuff movie theme and allowed the player to kill antagonists with varying levels of violence , dependent on how much time was spent sneaking behind them . It was the first to show visual executions in the genre . The following year , Konami 's Metal Gear Acid combined the stealth gameplay of the Metal Gear series with turn @-@ based strategy and tactical role @-@ playing game elements as well as card battle elements from Konami 's own Yu @-@ Gi @-@ Oh ! games . 
 In 2004 , Metal Gear Solid 3 : Snake Eater ( PlayStation 2 ) introduced camouflage to the genre . Set in a jungle , the game emphasized infiltration in a natural environment , along with survival aspects such as food capture , healing and close @-@ quarters combat . The following year , the updated version Metal Gear Solid 3 : Subsistence introduced an online multiplayer element to the genre . Another 2004 release was The Chronicles of Riddick : Escape From Butcher Bay , based on the Chronicles of Riddick series of movies . The game follows the character of Riddick as he attempts to escape from prison . Action and stealth gaming are combined seamlessly by allowing the character to hide , sneak , or fight his way past most situations . The game was critically acclaimed , and was followed with The Chronicles of Riddick : Assault on Dark Athena in 2009 . 
 In 2007 , Assassin 's Creed employed a social element to the stealth game , where the player is able to hide among crowds of civilians by taking care to blend in . The same year , Crytek 's open world first @-@ person shooter Crysis incorporated stealth elements within its gameplay , as did the multiplayer first @-@ person shooter Team Fortress 2 the same year and the first @-@ person role @-@ playing game Fallout 3 the following year . In 2008 , Metal Gear Solid 4 : Guns of the Patriots ( PlayStation 3 ) introduced a <unk> element , where the stealth gameplay is incorporated into a battlefield fought between two armies , both of which can be infiltrated by Solid Snake . In 2009 , Assassin 's Creed II broadened its predecessor 's elements of stealth by allowing the player to blend among any group of civilians , rather than specific ones . Assassin 's Creed II also allowed the player to distract guards by tossing coins or by hiring thieves and courtesans , and also featured a notoriety level , which made the player more recognizable until they paid off officials or tore down wanted posters . The same year , Uncharted 2 : Among Thieves and Batman : Arkham Asylum incorporated stealth elements in different segments of the games . The multiplayer modes of Aliens vs. Predator in 2010 and Killzone 3 in 2011 also incorporated stealth elements . 
 The 2012 game Dishonored tried to incorporate stealth elements that were influenced by Thief , such as the importance of lighting and shadows . The developers later abandoned that system citing realism as a factor . The game instead relies on a system of " occlusion @-@ based " stealth , using the vision cones of the enemies , obstacles , and special abilities which determines whether or not the character is visible . Forbes called Dishonored one of the best stealth games of 2012 , along with Hitman Absolution and Mark of the Ninja . Mark of the Ninja puts a twist on the stealth genre in that it is a 2D side @-@ scroller . This posed some unique factors , such as the lack of corners for the character to hide behind , and the visibility presented in a side @-@ scroller ; the developers overcame this by adding ' fog ' that prevents the player from seeing things that the character can not see , visually representing enemy line @-@ of @-@ sight and even visualizing the noise made by the character , including how far that noise travels . After the completion of the game , the player has access to a harder difficulty called " New Game Plus " , which further decreases visibility by adding fog behind the player and removes noise visualizations and enemy line of sight indicators .

After trying to catch up on time he lost doing these things , Homer is arrested for speeding . He calls Barney , who is asked to pay $ 50 to bail him out . After being acquitted , he tells off his boss Mr. Burns and has one last drink at Moe 's Tavern with his friends , causing him to miss dinner with his waiting family .

 The episode was written by Nell Scovell and directed by Wes Archer . In the episode , Bart and Lisa sneak into the sushi bar 's karaoke room and sing the theme song to the 1971 film Shaft , " Theme from Shaft " . The Fox network censors originally did not want the staff to use the song because they thought the lyrics were too obscene to appear on television . In order to prove the censors wrong and show that it could appear on television , the staff dug up footage from an old Academy Awards ceremony at which the song was performed by Isaac Hayes . When the chef of the sushi bar finds out that Homer has been poisoned , he yells at his apprentices in Japanese . The staff wanted the language they spoke to be actual Japanese , so they hired a Japanese actor who translated the lines for them . The episode introduced the character Akira , who has appeared many times later on the show . American actor George Takei provided the voice of Akira . The episode featured many other guest appearances ; Larry King as himself ; Sab Shimono as the sushi bar chef ; Joey <unk> as Toshiro , the apprentice chef who slices up the fugu ; and Diane Tanaka as hostess of the bar . King 's role was first offered to American singer Bruce Springsteen , but he turned it down . According to showrunner Sam Simon , actor William Shatner also rejected the part . 
 " One Fish , Two Fish , Blowfish , Blue Fish " originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on January 24 , 1991 . The episode was selected for release in a video collection of selected episodes , titled The Last Temptation of Homer , that was released on November 9 , 1998 . Other episodes included in the collection set were " Colonel Homer " , " Homer Alone " , and " Simpson and Delilah " . The episode was again included in the 2005 DVD release of the Last Temptation of Homer set . It was also released in May 1998 on the seventh volume of the Best of The Simpsons video collection , together with " Bart Gets Hit by a Car " . The episode was later included on The Simpsons season two DVD set ; released on August 6 , 2002 . Scovell , Matt Groening , Al Jean , and Mike Reiss participated in the DVD 's audio commentary . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 The episode name is a parody of One Fish Two Fish Red Fish Blue Fish by Dr. Seuss . The sushi bar that the Simpson family visits is located on a street called Elm Street , a reference to the A Nightmare on Elm Street film franchise . While waiting for Homer to finish his meal at the sushi bar , Bart and Lisa sneak into the bar 's karaoke room and sing the theme song to the 1971 film Shaft , " Theme from Shaft " by Isaac Hayes . In the karaoke room , a gentleman introduces himself as Richie Sakai , a reference to a producer on The Simpsons with the same name . He proceeds to sing the 1971 song " Gypsies , Tramps & Thieves " by Cher . Homer sings his own version of the gospel hymn " When the Saints Go Marching In " while listening to Lisa playing her saxophone one last time . When Homer arrives at his home after leaving Moe 's Tavern , he hammers on one of the windows of the house and shouts Marge 's name . This is a reference to the 1967 film The Graduate , in which Ben Braddock ( Dustin Hoffman ) does the same and runs to the church , pounds on the window , and yells " Elaine ! Elaine ! " As Homer awaits his death , he listens to Larry King read the Bible on tape .

 In its original broadcast , " One Fish , Two Fish , Blowfish , Blue Fish " finished twenty @-@ seventh in the ratings for the week of January 21 – 27 , 1991 , with a Nielsen rating of 14 @.@ 1 , equivalent to thirteen million viewing households . It was the highest @-@ rated show on the Fox network that week . 
 Since airing , the episode has received mostly positive reviews from television critics . DVD Movie Guide 's Colin Jacobson said that despite a " potentially gimmicky tone " , the episode provided " a lot of fun moments along with a little emotional content as well . The show usually balanced sentimentality cleanly , and that occurred here ; it avoided becoming too syrupy and featured just enough emotion to make an impact . It also contained some great bits , like Bart and Lisa ’ s karaoke performance of the ' Theme from Shaft ' . It also ended on a hilarious and incisive note . " Jacobson 's favorite line of the episode was the sushi restaurant hostess 's " This is our karaoke bar . Now it is empty , but soon it will be hopping with drunken Japanese businessmen . " The authors of the book I Can 't Believe It 's a Bigger and Better Updated Unofficial Simpsons Guide , Warren Martyn and Adrian Wood , wrote : " Again , a playful dig at racial stereotypes . Homer comes over as a reasonable man who wants to live his last day in style , and the closing twist is easily as good as the farewells leading up to it . " Jeremy Kleinman of DVD Talk said that the episode is " rich with sentimentality and Homer 's expression of love for his family as he fears that his time is up . " He also commented that while all of the chalkboard gags on the show are " funny " , this episode " features a true gem " as Bart writes " I will not cut corners " once and then puts ditto marks below . Ed Potton of The Times wrote : " The writers offer black humour by the <unk> , but the grim reality of Homer 's fate is never in doubt ; his eventual collapse is deeply affecting . A great example of [ the show 's ] fierce satire being offset by a potent emotional core . " Doug Pratt , a DVD reviewer and Rolling Stone contributor , said the first half of the episode has " fun skewering Japanese restaurants and such , while the second half is reasonably successful at emphasizing character while sustaining the comedy . " 
 In a review of the second season , Bryce Wilson of Cinema Blend commented : " The worst moments of this season are merely uninspired , never truly horrible . Slight misses like “ Dancin ' Homer ” , “ One Fish , Two Fish , Blowfish , Blue Fish ” , “ Bart 's Dog Gets an F ” , and “ The War of the Simpsons ” are a bit flat . But even in their lowest points , humor is easy to find . " Jeremy Roebuck of <unk> named this episode , along with " Bart Sells His Soul " , " Homer the Heretic " , " Simpsons Bible Stories " , and " She of Little Faith " , one of the best Simpsons episodes with a religious theme . Dawn Taylor of The DVD Journal thought Homer 's line to Bart , " I want to share something with you , the three little sentences that will get you through life . Number one : ' Cover for me . ' Number two : ' Oh , good idea , boss . ' Number three , ' It was like that when I got here . ' " , was the best line of the episode . 
 = The American Israelite = 
 The American Israelite is a Jewish weekly newspaper published in Cincinnati , Ohio . Founded in 1854 as The Israelite and assuming its present name in 1874 , it is the longest @-@ running English @-@ language Jewish newspaper still published in the United States . 
 The paper 's founder , Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise , and publisher , Edward Bloch and his Bloch Publishing Company , were both very influential figures in American Jewish life . During the 19th century , The American Israelite became the leading organ for Reform Judaism in America . During the early 20th century , it helped geographically dispersed American Jews , especially in the West and the South of the country , keep in touch with Jewish affairs and their religious identity . 
 = = Founding and early history = = 
 The first Jewish newspaper published in Cincinnati was the English @-@ language The Israelite , established on July 15 , 1854 . It was also among the first Jewish publications in the nation . It was founded by Rabbi Isaac Mayer Wise , who became known as the father of Reform Judaism in the United States . Its initial issues were published by Charles F. Schmidt . The paper lost $ 600 in its first year , and although Wise repaid the publisher out of his own funds , Schmidt terminated the relationship . Edward Bloch and his Bloch Publishing Company began to publish the paper with the issue of July 27 , 1855 . Bloch , who was Wise 's brother @-@ in @-@ law , subsequently became known as the dean of American Jewish publishers . 
 From the start , the newspaper 's motto was <unk> <unk> " Let There Be Light , " and still is . Its two goals were to propagate the principles of Reform Judaism and to keep American Jews , who often lived in small towns singly or in communities of two or three families , in touch with Jewish affairs and their religious identity . 
 The publication , along with Die Deborah , a German @-@ language supplement that Wise started the following year , soon attracted a large circulation and was influential in helping the nascent Reform movement spread throughout North America . Both Wise and the paper had a reach beyond Cincinnati , and especially to the growing Jewish communities in the American Midwest and South . In 1858 , for instance , the members of Congregation B 'nai Israel in Memphis , Tennessee advertised for their first rabbi in The Israelite , at the same time they advertised for a kosher butcher . 
 Despite its spread , the early years of The Israelite were a financial struggle . Most subscribers did not pay their bills , the Panic of 1857 adversely affected it , and the paper lost half its subscribers in the South during the Civil War . Bloch travelled east several times in the late 1850s in order to solicit subscriptions and advertising . Wise 's admitted sloppiness in monetary matters did not help either . Nevertheless , the newspaper and Bloch stayed out of bankruptcy and relocated to larger offices twice during this period . 
 Wise , a prolific writer , published in the editorial columns of The Israelite numerous studies on various subjects of Jewish interest . Besides being the leading organ for American Reform Judaism , it also forcefully defended the civil and religious rights of all Jews . Wise tirelessly expounded his call to the " ministers and other Israelites " of the United States , urging them to form a union which might put an end to the prevalent religious anarchy . In 1873 , twenty @-@ five years after he had first broached the idea , the Union of American Hebrew Congregations was organized at Cincinnati . Another campaign he presented in the columns of The Israelite was the desire for an educational institution , and this eventually led to success in 1875 when the Hebrew Union College opened its doors for the reception of students . Wise also wrote a number of novels , which appeared first as serials in the Israelite . 
 = = New name and continued influence = = 
 The Israelite was renamed The American Israelite beginning with the issue of July 3 , 1874 . The goal was to make the name more in consonance with the ideas it represented . Despite the change , the paper continued to cover and advocate for not only American Jews but also Jews around the world . By 1879 , a typical issue had eight pages 28 @-@ by @-@ 42 @-@ inches in size , and a subscription cost $ 4 , or $ 5 if the Die Deborah four @-@ page supplement was included . 
 Rabbi Wise 's son Leo Wise , who had become business manager for the paper in 1875 , took over as its publisher from 1883 to 1884 , and then he did so again , permanently , in 1888 ( due apparently to some kind of rupture between Leo Wise and Bloch ) . A sister publication , The Chicago Israelite , was started in 1885 . The papers stressed their reputation in trade publications , stating " None but clean advertisements of reputable houses accepted . " 
 Leo Wise gradually took over the principle editorial functions from his father , but Rabbi Wise remained active on the paper until his death on March 26 , 1900 , writing an editorial for it just a few days before . Ownership then passed to Leo Wise . 
 By 1900 , The American Israelite , in combination with The Chicago Israelite , claimed a circulation of other 35 @,@ 000 , about 12 @,@ 000 in Ohio and Illinois and the balance spread across almost every other state as well as Canada and Mexico . The publication Printer 's Ink said they had the largest guaranteed circulation of any Jewish newspaper in the U.S. , and it continued to be especially strong in the West and the South . One 1902 book characterized The American Israelite as " the leading Jewish newspaper in the United States and the National Journal of the Jews . " 
 In the early 20th century , the paper 's short articles were sometimes picked up and run by The New York Times with a credit " From The American Israelite " . In those years , The American Israelite became known for its very strong stance against the new Zionism movement , calling it in 1902 a " pernicious agitation " that would undermine the acceptance of Jews in the countries where they currently resided . Rabbi David Philipson was among the editorial contributors to the paper who used it to oppose Zionism , arguing that Judaism was a religion exclusively , and thus stateless . Other noted contributors to the paper in this era included Rabbi Moses Mielziner and Jewish history scholar Gotthard Deutsch , as well as other prominent rabbis and Jewish thinkers within the country . The paper gave extensive coverage to the goings @-@ on of the Union of American Hebrew Congregations and the Hebrew Union College ( and was sometimes viewed as a publication of them ) , as well as notices of various rabbinical conferences . 
 Die Deborah was discontinued after Isaac Wise 's death , then resumed for a while . The Chicago Israelite ceased publication in 1920 . Leo Wise edited The American Israelite until his retirement at age 78 in 1928 ( he died in 1933 ) . Another son of Isaac , Isidor Wise , worked as a writer and associate editor for the paper until his death in 1929 . 
 = = Subsequent history = = 
 Leo Wise was succeeded as editor and publisher of The American Israelite in 1928 by his half @-@ brother , Rabbi Jonah Wise of New York , who remained in that city and who himself became a long @-@ time leader of American Reform Judaism . 
 The Jonah Wise arrangement did not last long , and in 1930 , journalist Henry C. Segal bought the paper and became its editor and publisher for more than five decades , until his death in 1985 . Along with Isaac Wise , Segal is still named on the paper 's masthead . 
 Contributors to the newspaper in the late 1980s and early 1990s included writer Don Canaan . His four @-@ part series published in 1988 , " Jews in Ohio 's Prisons : Does Anyone Care ? " , won the award for best weekly journalism from the Ohio State Bar Association . 
 By the 1990s , the paper was focusing on local Jewish news . In 1995 , The American Israelite was sued for $ 2 million by an Ohio lawyer for calling him and his son anti @-@ Semitic . 
 By 2010 , Ted Deutsch was the editor and publisher . A typical issue ran 24 pages , with color front and back pages and black @-@ and @-@ white inside . Some stories were locally written , while many others were run from the Jewish Telegraphic Agency . It published full facsimile copies of its issues on its website . 
 = Underbelly ( series 1 ) = 
 Underbelly , the first series of Australian crime television drama series Underbelly . The thirteen @-@ part series originally aired from 13 February 2008 to 7 May 2008 on the Nine Network and is loosely based on the real events of the 1995 – 2004 gangland war in Melbourne . It depicts the key players in Melbourne 's criminal underworld , including the Carlton Crew and their rival , Carl Williams . The series is based on the book Leadbelly : Inside Australia 's Underworld , by journalists John Silvester and Andrew Rule , and borrows its name from the successful Underbelly true crime anthology book series also authored by Silvester and Rule . An alternative and significantly updated tie @-@ in novel , Underbelly : The Gangland War , was released as their 13th book in the series . The series is produced by the Australian Film Finance Corporation , in association with Film Victoria . The executive producers are Des Monaghan and Jo Horsburgh . 
 The lead @-@ up to Underbelly involved a heavy marketing campaign which covered radio , print , billboards and an increased online presence , including the use of social networking tools . At a reported cost of $ 500 @,@ 000 , both this marketing investment and potentially millions of dollars in advertising revenue were claimed to be put at risk by the Victorian Supreme Court 's injunction , as the series was expected to attract 800 @,@ 000 to 1 million viewers in Victoria alone . The injunction was put in place to ensure that upcoming criminal trials were not unfair to the accused , because the series contained fictionalised re @-@ enactments of several disputed events . Underbelly began screening on 13 February 2008 on the Nine Network in all states and territories except Victoria . An edited version of the series premiered in Victoria on 14 September 2008 after the injunction was partially lifted , although only the first five episodes were shown . In 2011 , the injunction was partially lifted and the series was screened as " Underbelly : Uncut " . This rebroadcast included scenes from the original DVD release , as well as several significant changes that were made to keep the show current , including a newly recorded final voiceover and the crediting of several characters that were previously uncredited ( allowable due to the ending of related trials ) . Some previously named characters in the final episode however are now unable to be named , resulting in a continued banning of the sale of the video release in Victoria . 
 Underbelly was a critical and ratings success , being described as " Australia 's best ever crime drama " . Despite this critical success , the series has been the target of controversy due to its <unk> depiction of crime and violence . The opening double episodes , which aired on 13 February , attracted an average of 1 @,@ 320 @,@ 000 viewers nationally , minus Victoria . Every episode of the 13 @-@ part series was soon made available for download on a range of sites , with the Nine Network saying it was considering legal action . The legal DVD of Underbelly was released on 8 May 2008 , a day after the final episode was aired on television . Due to the legal suppression , the release was not able to be distributed through any retail or rental outlets in Victoria or on the internet . The ban remains in place in 2013 , due to legal issues involving the final episode of the show . It was the first in a continuing series , and was later followed by Underbelly : A Tale of Two Cities , Underbelly : The Golden Mile , Underbelly : Razor , Underbelly : <unk> , Underbelly : Squizzy and the sequel to the first series Fat Tony & Co . , as well as three television films released as Underbelly Files .

 = = = Overview = = = 
 Underbelly is a fictionalised account of the events behind the Melbourne gangland war that lasted from 1995 until 2004 . In the first episode , the Carlton Crew crime syndicate is introduced , comprising stand @-@ over man Alphonse Gangitano ( Vince Colosimo ) , Domenic " Mick " Gatto ( Simon <unk> ) , <unk> Mario Condello ( Martin Sacks ) , retired bank robber Graham <unk> ( Gerard Kennedy ) and drug @-@ dealing siblings Jason and Mark Moran ( Les Hill and Callan Mulvey ) and their father Lewis ( Kevin Harrington ) . Jason Moran 's seemingly harmless and half @-@ witted driver Carl Williams ( Gyton Grantley ) is also introduced , along with two police characters ; Steve Owen ( Rodger <unk> ) and Jacqui James ( Caroline Craig ) , the most prominent members of Task Force Purana . 
 Alphonse Gangitano , the self @-@ styled " Black Prince of Lygon Street " , kills a man at a party over a small debt and , with Jason 's assistance , injures 13 innocent people . During his trial , Gangitano is murdered by Jason , although the killing goes unsolved . The Moran brothers buy a pill press and employ Carl Williams to produce their drugs . Carl secretly begins making his own supply and forms an alliance with Moran rival Tony Mokbel ( Robert Mammone ) . When Carl is busted by the police , Jason discovers his double @-@ cross and shoots him in the stomach , before Jason is arrested . Mark Moran takes over the drug business , selling Tony Mokbel out to a corrupt officer from the drug squad . Carl kills Mark with the assistance of drug dealer Dino Dibra ( Daniel <unk> ) and L ( Ian Bliss ) , who establish an alibi . Lewis Moran hires Andrew " Benji " Veniamin ( Damian Walshe @-@ Howling ) to avenge his stepson , believing the killer to be Dibra . Benji kills Dibra then offers his services to Carl and becomes his bodyguard , although Carl is eventually jailed . Carl 's wife , Roberta ( Kat Stewart ) , is forced to run the business and she begins an affair with Benji . 
 Carl is released from jail and Jason Moran is given special parole conditions to allow him to move to London . Moran rival Nik " The Russian " Radev ( Don Hany ) becomes a liability and Carl has him murdered by Benji and T. ( Alex Dimitriades ) . Jason returns from London and a concerned Lewis offers to run the business , but is arrested during a bust . With Benji under constant police observation , Carl asks L. and T. to murder Jason , who is executed in front of his children . Carl orders a hit on small @-@ time dealer Willie Thompson , who turns out to be a friend of Tony Mokbel . However , Tony blames another small @-@ time dealer , Michael Marshall , for the crime and asks Carl to kill him . Carl 's hitmen L. and T. shoot Marshall and are immediately arrested , but the police are unable to prove Carl 's involvement in the crime . 
 When Graham <unk> is murdered , Carl agrees to end the violence and asks Benji to murder Gatto . Gatto instead kills Benji and is arrested , although he is later acquitted . A new thug , Keith Faure ( Kym Gyngell ) ( only named in the 2011 " Uncut " broadcast ) , offers to team up with Carl , while his real motive is to take over for himself . Several days later , Faure kills Lewis Moran in a crowded bar . Consumed by revenge for Benji 's death , his friend , convicted killer Lewis Caine ( Marcus Graham ) , decides to kill Condello , the only surviving member of the Carlton Crew . However , Caine is double @-@ crossed by his accomplices and is murdered beforehand . Detective Owen has Condello 's bodyguard " Tibor " arrested . They agree to have Tibor act as an undercover agent to record Condello ordering a hit on Carl . Meanwhile , Carl 's jailed associates testify against him . In the series final episode , Task Force Purana and Owen arrest Carl at a family barbecue . A voice @-@ over , performed by police officer Jacqui James , reveals that Mick Gatto is eventually acquitted for the killing of Andrew Veniamin and that Mario Condello is killed while awaiting trial on attempted murder charges . The final voice @-@ over was rerecorded during the production of Underbelly : Razor in preparation for the 2011 airing of the show in Victoria to also include information on Carl Williams ' murder , and Tony Mokbel 's arrest in a " cheap wig " in Greece . 
 = = = Inaccuracies = = = 
 While the series retells the real events of the gangland war , several inaccuracies have been pointed out and some deliberate <unk> have been made . The Purana Taskforce , as presented in this series , is not a portrayal of the real taskforce , as laws in Victoria do not allow real police officers , including those who previously served and were not sacked , to be portrayed by actors in the media . As a result , the characters presented are entirely fictional characters vaguely based on the real officers , leading to some major differences such as the series suggesting that a senior officer died due to a heart attack , which never in fact occurred . 
 In the first episode when Steve Owen pulls over Susie Money , when she hands him her license , one can momentarily see the birth date on the back of the card ; it shows her birth year as 1984 . Being that it is 1995 at the time of this scene , that would make her 11 years old . 
 In the second episode , during the outdoor scene after Alphonse 's funeral , a tram stop sign can be seen . This style and design of tram signage wasn 't introduced until well into the 2000s . 
 When Carl Williams is shot in the series by Moran the shooting takes place at the Willamstown Botanical Gardens in Willamstown , in front of Willamstown Beach , however the real shooting occurred in Broadmeadows , where no shoreline can be seen . 
 In the seventh episode , Paul <unk> is murdered in his home by Andrew Veniamin , and in the following episode , Victor Peirce is murdered outside of his home . While both murders occurred in 2002 , the series timeline is incorrect , as Peirce was murdered on 1 May , and <unk> was murdered on 15 October . 
 The execution of Victor Peirce in episode eight is portrayed as taking place in his car at the front of his home , but Peirce was shot dead while parked opposite a supermarket in Bay Street , Port Melbourne . The murder of alleged drug dealer Willie Thompson was portrayed in episode ten as Thompson being shot after leaving a martial arts class in broad daylight . However , Thompson was shot dead at around 9 : 30 pm , and the murder occurred on Waverley Road in the Melbourne suburb of <unk> , as he began to drive off in his car , directly outside the entrance to the martial arts centre . Another fiction portrayed was the murder of Nik Radev by both Victor <unk> and Andrew Veniamin in the late hours of the night when Radev was in fact ambushed on a residential street in Coburg in the company of two bodyguards in the late afternoon . 
 In all episodes showing the Melbourne skyline , the Eureka Tower is shown ; however , the building was not actually completed until 2006 , at least two years after the events depicted in the series . 
 Radio Station 3AW is heard on the frequency of 693 kHz in 2004 ; it only change to this frequency in 2006 .

 Underbelly is based on the book Leadbelly : Inside Australia 's Underworld , by Age journalists John Silvester and Andrew Rule . As the Nine Network was interested in creating local and world @-@ class television , they decided to invest in a drama series that told the story of the Melbourne gangland killings . Jo Horsburgh , Nine Network Head of Drama , stated that the network was " 100 percent committed to bringing Underbelly to the small screen " . Des Monaghan , executive producer for <unk> , called the series " one of the most exciting and challenging drama projects ever shot in [ Australia ] " . The script took 12 months to write , beginning in June 2006 , with the main writers , Greg Haddrick , Peter Gawler and Felicity Packard putting together an entire episode themselves before their scripts were edited . Haddrick , <unk> 's Head of Drama , felt that the challenge for the writing team was to " capture the essential truth of these extraordinary events in a compelling and coherent manner " . 
 Underbelly was filmed in Melbourne , at locations around the city where the real @-@ life events occurred . Filming took over 82 days , from 2 July to 19 October 2007 , with 150 inner urban locations utilised and 450 locations surveyed making the series as close to life as possible . Parts of the series were filmed in the Essendon area , near many of the houses and schools associated with the " Underworld " . Many of the Carlton scenes were filmed in North Melbourne , primarily around Errol Street . All La <unk> filming was done at Rubicon Restaurant Errol Street , and jail visit sequences were filmed in the dressing rooms at the Telstra Dome . 
 = = = Marketing = = = 
 The Nine Network spent more than fifteen million dollars producing and promoting Underbelly . The lead @-@ up resulted in a heavy marketing campaign which covered radio , print , billboards and an increased online presence , including the use of social networking tools . When the CEO of the Nine Network , David Gyngell noted the need to up its online presence , and embrace social networking as a valuable marketing tool , the official website was launched . The original website was launched on 15 January 2008 , with only a 3 @-@ minute trailer ; while the full site , with all its features , launched on 1 February 2008 . It was announced that the full first episode would be available for download on the site on 10 February , three days before the show premieres on television , but this option was made unavailable due to the Supreme court suppression case . This intention follows a similar strategy used for the launch of Sea Patrol in 2007 . The site was " poised to become " the biggest and most detailed website the Nine Network has hosted for a show so far , including features such as behind the scenes footage , profiles , visitor interactivity and the use of social networking tools . Due to the court injunction , the Nine Network was ordered to remove character profiles from its official website in Victoria . 
 According to its marketing , Underbelly " uses the framework of the murderous war between the two gangs , and the bigger moral war between the gangs and the Purana Task Force , to explore a complex array of individual stories and relationships — some touching , some incredible , all breathtaking — it is a mini @-@ series that examines the kaleidoscopic nature of loyalty , love , revenge and pride when the normal and identifiable emotions of human attachment are moved from the context of social decency to social indecency .

 The series ' first prequel , Underbelly : A Tale of Two Cities , revolves around the organised crime groups that stemmed from the Griffith @-@ based dope trade . The series follows the lives of two late infamous drug lords , " Aussie Bob " <unk> and Terry " Mr Asia " Clark , portrayed by Roy Billing and Matthew Newton respectively . Filming took place in both Sydney and Melbourne until March 2009 . Sydney locations Richmond , Bondi Beach and Warwick Farm were used to portray Griffith in the 1970s . Writers Peter Gawler and Greg Haddrick admitted that there was more nudity and sex than the original . The prequel premiered on 9 February 2009 to 2 @.@ 5 million viewers , making it the highest rated non @-@ sporting program in the history of Australian television ratings . The second prequel , titled Underbelly : The Golden Mile , began airing on 11 April 2010 . A telemovie trilogy known as The Underbelly Files was made and then aired in early 2011 . The three <unk> Infiltration , The Man Who Got Away , and Tell Them Lucifer Was Here . The fourth series , Underbelly : Razor , began airing on 21 August 2011 and was mostly concerned with telling the story of 1920s criminal matriarchs Tilly Devine and Kate Leigh . It was also therefore a prequel to the original series . A New Zealand version titled Underbelly NZ : Land Of The Long Green Cloud aired in 2011 . The fifth series , Underbelly : <unk> which tells the story of modern Sydney underworld figure Anthony Perish first aired on 13 August 2012 . The current production , Underbelly : Squizzy , is set to air in late 2013 and is a biography of Squizzy Taylor .

 The first episode of the series was screened privately to media on 17 January 2008 , prior the media had been treated with extracts and trailers promoting the series . On 3 January 2008 , The Sydney Morning Herald 's critic Michael Idato declared the series " The Blue Murder of its time " , referring to the critically acclaimed 1995 ABC TV drama Blue Murder , considered by many to be the finest crime drama ever produced in Australia . In a review on his blog on 17 January 2008 , David Knox , stated that Underbelly " is our own Sopranos " , and awarded it 4 @.@ 5 out of 5 . He also commented " If there are any criticisms to be found with Underbelly , they are few . One or two shots give away that period Melbourne was actually shot in 2007 . And while watching these gangsters thrive on power with ballsy disdain , it was hard not to think of the behaviour of some television executives in recent history . This aside , Underbelly looks set to be one of the highlights of the 2008 television year . " A review appeared in the Herald Sun on 18 January 2008 , in which critic Paul Anderson quoted : " Whether you followed the Melbourne gangland war or not , there 's a fair chance you will be blown away by the coming TV series Underbelly . [ It ] is a slick , violent and sexually charged dramatisation backed by a ripping soundtrack . " In an article appearing on 31 January 2008 , The Daily Telegraph 's TV editor , Marcus Casey , said of Underbelly after viewing the first four episodes : " If the quality is maintained then , while not perfect , Underbelly should equal , if not better , Australia 's best ever crime dramas – the Phoenix series and Blue Murder . "

 On 11 February 2008 the Australian Family Association ( AFA ) , was publicly outraged that Underbelly would be screening at 8 : 30 pm , well within reach of children , after clips of the series were leaked onto the internet . The clips highlighted the use of extreme profanities , and scenes that show a violent bashing , a cold @-@ blooded murder , and a sexual encounter . The Nine Network defended the timeslot and the M classification , saying the clips , leaked from the Network 's production department , were indeed from the series , but not all of them made the final cut . The Network set its own classification , under the accepted rules of the Australian Commercial Television Code of Conduct . The Australian Family Association threatened to take the matter to Communications Minister Stephen Conroy if the content of the show was anything near that of an unauthorised promotional clip leaked from Nine 's production department .

 George Defteros , a high @-@ profile lawyer , against whom criminal charges were dropped because the prosecution did not have enough evidence , disrupted the lead @-@ up to the series ' launch , when he threatened the Nine Network with a Supreme Court writ on 26 January 2008 . Defteros , said to be portrayed by George <unk> , engaged a top Melbourne defamation specialist , saying : 
 " Any attempt to depict me as a lawyer of low impropriety and unethical behaviour will be met with legal proceedings instituted by my lawyers , I regard the depiction of the gangland wars , in particular my role as a lawyer acting for parties , as nothing more than farcical and pure pantomime . We 'll be watching it very closely . " 
 Nine Network had subsequently said there would now be no direct reference to Mr Defteros , despite earlier publicity . A spokeswoman for the network said " There is no lawyer called Defteros in Underbelly " , but Defteros said he could still be defamed by implication , noting " it 's already been advertised as me " . The case was dropped by Director of Public Prosecutions Paul Coghlan , QC , due to a lack of evidence . 
 = = = Supreme Court suppression = = = 
 The screening of Underbelly in Victoria was put into jeopardy after last @-@ minute legal proceedings were instituted by the Director of Public Prosecutions , Jeremy <unk> , QC . <unk> secured an urgent viewing of the series , after which he decided to seek an injunction stopping its broadcast in Victoria . A Supreme Court judge called prosecutors and defence lawyers together after serious concerns were raised about whether the show could prejudice the jury in the trial of Evangelos Goussis , who had pleaded not guilty to the 2004 gangland killing of Lewis Moran . Although Goussis was not named in the series , there were concerns the show could hurt his chance of a fair trial . 
 The Supreme Court hearing took place on 11 February 2008 – only two days before the series was due to premiere . The Nine Network was ordered by a DPP subpoena to hand over tapes of all 13 episodes , as well as outlines and story lines , to the Victorian Supreme Court by 10 am on that date . The Nine Network refused to voluntarily hand over the tapes , saying they were incomplete and that the network 's lawyers were closely supervising production . However , it was willing to comply with any Court order and took the matter very seriously . The Network was also adamant that the series makes no assertions about the guilt of the accused killer . At the hearing , which took place at the Geelong Supreme Court , Justice Betty King gave prosecution and defence lawyers 24 hours to view the series and return to court the following day to decide whether it had the potential to affect the forthcoming trial . Justice King issued a suppression order on 12 February banning the Nine Network from broadcasting the series in the state of Victoria and on the internet until after the murder trial was completed . The Nine Network offered to air a heavily edited version in Victoria , but the offer was rejected by Justice King . It was initially planned that an alternative program , Underbelly : A Special Announcement , discussing the subject matter of the series , would air in Victoria instead of the series premiere . This idea was scrapped , and the movie The Shawshank Redemption was aired in Victoria instead . The Nine Network declared their intention to appeal the decision , and Network lawyers stated that they would exercise all legal options . 
 The injunction also affected national audiences receiving transmissions from <unk> Television , a Nine Network affiliate , because its single national satellite distribution signal is retransmitted in some parts of Victoria . Alternative programming was to be shown until the restriction was lifted . 
 The appeal began on 29 February 2008 in the Victorian Court of Appeal . Nine Network lawyers argued that the network should be allowed to broadcast the first three episodes of the series , arguing Justice King had erred in her decision to suppress the series because she had viewed the unedited version , rather than the final edited cut that was to be shown to audiences . The network believed the first three episodes , which depicted events from the beginning of the underworld war in 1995 , would have no potential to prejudice any part of the trial . Goussis 's murder trial was due to begin on 31 March 2008 . The judges overseeing the appeal retired to decide their verdict on 3 March 2008 . Their decision on 26 March 2008 upheld Justice King 's ruling that the series was not to be broadcast or distributed in or out of Victoria . During the appeal the Nine Network had proposed to screen the first three episodes immediately after any successful appeal , and would give the court seven days written notice of its intention to show any further episodes that it believed would not prejudice the murder trial . The Court of Appeal had dismissed the network 's application to appeal , and the network was compelled to comply with the suppression order issued by Justice King until the offending trial was complete . 
 The ban expired the week ending 30 May 2008 , with the conviction of Goussis for the murder of Lewis Moran , paving the way for Nine to begin screening episodes ; however , Andrew Rule , who co @-@ wrote the book on which the series is based , says Underbelly will not be seen in Victoria anytime soon , saying " the problem now will be that Tony Mokbel is back in Australia and ready to stand trial on very serious charges . That will effectively prevent the series being screened in Victoria until that trial is held ... That could be some time . I 'm not sure about several [ years ] , but it might be two years . " However , Underbelly was legally shown in Victoria in September 2008 , after a court ruled that the network could air the first five episodes . Supreme Court Justice Peter Vickery gave the network permission to air the specially edited episodes , but said screening the sixth episode could prejudice the upcoming trials of an accused criminal . The edited versions had whole scenes cut out , and Tony Mokbel 's face was pixelated . Reactions from viewers were not favourable , mainly because most had already seen the entire series . 
 = = Underbelly : Uncut ( 2011 Victorian Broadcast Version ) = = 
 The suppression order was partially lifted after Mokbel 's trial in April 2011 , after which the series was broadcast in Victoria . A 9 : 30pm timeslot allowed the airing of the ' Uncut ' edition , based on the episodes as they appeared in the DVD / Blu @-@ ray release , and a few further alterations were made to update the show 's significantly outdated summary of current events . The final voice over of the series , in the episode " Purana " , was rerecorded ( during production of Underbelly : Razor ) to include events that occurred up to , and including , 2011 ( such as Carl Williams ' murder and Tony Mokbel 's arrest ) . It is almost a minute longer than the original voice over summary . Other episodes contained less significant changes to the original voice over summaries , indicating they had also been rerecorded . 
 Kym <unk> ( Keith Faure ) , Alex Dimitriades ( Victor <unk> ) and Ian Bliss ( Thomas Hentschel ) are now fully credited in the episodes in which they starred , with the textual explanation given that their characters could not be named at the time of production but can now be named as of 2011 , due to the end of their related trials . They are still unnamed in the dialog of each episode . 
 The show , however , is still not allowed to be sold on DVD / Blu @-@ ray in Victoria , because a character in the " Purana " episode that was named in the original broadcast and DVD / Blu @-@ ray release , was not allowed to be named at the time of the rebroadcast due to a pending court case and subsequently had their name edited out . Because the DVD / Blu @-@ ray release is based on the original 2008 broadcast and not the 2011 " Uncut " broadcast , it is still not allowed to be sold in Victoria until the suppression order is fully lifted , or the alternative version is released .

TV3 reinstated the series in its old timeslot , but rescheduled it to 11 : 15pm on Tuesday evenings just weeks later . TV3 senior publicist Nicole Wood said the show had failed to win new viewers in the Sunday slot , and even though they were " inundated with fans " when they took it off air , it " still didn 't rate " on its second showing . The series was brought back to primetime in July 2009 , after the sequel series performed well in New Zealand . Beginning with episode 1 , the series is currently playing every Thursday at 9 : 30pm .

 Despite the ban on broadcasting the series in Victoria , Victorians were still able to access episodes via illegal online distribution . The first episode was made available on torrent sites within 20 minutes of it concluding in New South Wales . The Nine Network reportedly obtained the IP address of the first person to upload the show , and network lawyers were considering legal action . The Australian Federation Against Copyright Theft ( <unk> ) was investigating the matter , and was expected to make a list of recommendations to Victoria Police . Fears of inside leaks were aroused when advance screener versions of the first eight episodes were posted online . 
 Every episode of the 13 @-@ part series was soon available for download on a range of sites . It was reported that on <unk> more than 3 @,@ 000 users were attempting to download episode seven late on the afternoon of 27 February 2008 . The Nine Network said it was considering legal action , and was looking into how copies got into the hands of underworld figures in Victoria , including Roberta Williams , the former wife of gangland kingpin Carl Williams . Unauthorised copies of the entire series were also made available to the public . People were offered a 4 @-@ disc DVD set for between A $ 10 and $ 80 in public places such as carparks and building sites . The episodes were commercial @-@ free and came with introductory station countdowns , suggesting a major leak from inside the network 's production department . 
 Two network employees had been questioned by the network over the matter , but both denied distributing any copies of the series . <unk> DVDs containing the first nine episodes of Underbelly were seized in a raid by police on a business in Melbourne 's western suburbs on 11 March 2008 .

 = SMS Kaiser Karl der Grosse = 
 SMS Kaiser Karl der Grosse ( His Majesty 's Ship " Charles the Great " ) was a German pre @-@ dreadnought battleship of the Kaiser Friedrich III class , built around the turn of the 20th century for the Kaiserliche Marine ( Imperial Navy ) . Kaiser Karl der Grosse was built in Hamburg , at the Blohm and Voss shipyard . She was laid down in September 1898 and was launched in October 1899 . A shipyard strike and an accidental grounding delayed her completion until February 1902 ; she was therefore the last member of her class to enter service . The ship was armed with four 24 @-@ centimeter ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) guns in two twin gun turrets and had a top speed of 17 @.@ 5 knots ( 32 @.@ 4 km / h ; 20 @.@ 1 mph ) . 
 Kaiser Karl der Grosse served with the active fleet until 1908 , and during this time she participated in the normal peacetime routine of training cruises and fleet maneuvers . By 1908 , the new " all @-@ big @-@ gun " dreadnought battleships were entering service . As the ship was completely obsolete , she was withdrawn from active service and placed in the Reserve Division . At the outbreak of World War I in August 1914 , the ship was placed back in active duty as a coastal defense ship in the V Battle Squadron , though by February 1915 she was again placed in reserve . Kaiser Karl der Grosse was briefly used as a training ship and ended her career as a prison ship for prisoners of war in Wilhelmshaven . Following the German defeat in November 1918 , the ship was sold to ship @-@ breakers and scrapped in 1920 . 
 = = Design = = 
 Kaiser Karl der Grosse was 125 @.@ 3 m ( 411 ft 1 in ) long overall and had a beam of 20 @.@ 4 m ( 66 ft 11 in ) and a draft of 7 @.@ 89 m ( 25 ft 11 in ) forward and 8 @.@ 25 m ( 27 ft 1 in ) aft . She displaced up to 11 @,@ 785 t ( 11 @,@ 599 long tons ) at full load . The ship was powered by three 3 @-@ cylinder vertical triple @-@ expansion steam engines , each driving one screw propeller . Steam was provided by four Marine @-@ type and eight cylindrical boilers , all of which burned coal . Kaiser Karl der Grosse 's powerplant was rated at 13 @,@ 000 metric horsepower ( 12 @,@ 822 ihp ; 9 @,@ 561 kW ) , which generated a top speed of 17 @.@ 5 knots ( 32 @.@ 4 km / h ; 20 @.@ 1 mph ) . She had a normal crew of 39 officers and 612 enlisted men . 
 The ship 's armament consisted of a main battery of four 24 cm ( 9 @.@ 4 in ) SK L / 40 guns in twin gun turrets , one fore and one aft of the central superstructure . Her secondary armament consisted of eighteen 15 cm ( 5 @.@ 9 inch ) SK L / 40 guns and twelve 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 45 in ) SK L / 30 quick @-@ firing guns mounted in casemates . The armament suite was rounded out with six 45 cm torpedo tubes , all in above @-@ water swivel mounts . The ship 's belt armor was 300 mm ( 11 @.@ 8 in ) thick , and the deck was 65 mm ( 2 @.@ 6 in ) thick . The conning tower and main battery turrets were protected with 250 mm ( 9 @.@ 8 in ) of armor plating , and the secondary casemates received 150 mm ( 5 @.@ 9 in ) of armor protection .

 Kaiser Wilhelm II , the emperor of Germany , believed that a strong navy was necessary for the country to expand its influence outside continental Europe . As a result , he initiated a program of naval expansion in the late 1880s ; the first battleships built under this program were the four Brandenburg @-@ class ships . These were immediately followed by the five Kaiser Friedrich III @-@ class battleships , of which Kaiser Karl der Grosse was a member . She was ordered under the contract name " B " as a new ship of the fleet . The ship 's keel was laid on 17 September 1898 at the Blohm & Voss in Hamburg under yard number 136 . She was the first capital ship to be built by the yard , and the second warship of any type . The new battleship was launched on 18 October 1899 and named for Charlemagne ( Karl der Grosse in German ) ; Wilhelm II gave the launching speech and Johann Georg <unk> , the Erster Bürgermeister ( First Mayor ) of Hamburg christened the ship . A major strike by shipyard workers in late 1900 significantly delayed completion of the ship . In October 1901 , a shipyard crew took the ship to the naval base at Wilhelmshaven , though while en route she ran aground in the lower Elbe . The hull was damaged in the incident , and the necessary repairs further delayed her entry into service ; she was not commissioned until 4 February 1902 . 
 Kaiser Karl der Grosse was assigned to the II Division of the I Squadron on 19 February , the last member of her class to enter active service . With the assignment of Kaiser Karl der Grosse , the I Squadron was now fully composed of modern battleships . The squadron went on a training cruise to Britain in April and May , followed by a tour of the Kiel Week sailing regatta in late June . The ships then took part in another training cruise to Norway in July and then the autumn maneuvers , which began in the Baltic on 31 August . During the exercises , Kaiser Karl der Grosse was assigned to the " hostile " force , as were several of her sister ships . The " hostile " force was first tasked with preventing the " German " squadron from passing through the Great Belt in the Baltic . Kaiser Karl der Grosse and several other battleships were then tasked with forcing an entry into the mouth of the Elbe River , where the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal and Hamburg could be seized . The " hostile " flotilla accomplished these tasks within three days . The maneuvers concluded in the North Sea with a fleet review in the Jade . From 1 to 12 December , the squadron went on its normal winter cruise to Norway . 
 In 1903 , the fleet , which was composed of only one squadron of battleships , was reorganized as the " Active Battle Fleet . " Kaiser Karl der Grosse remained in the I Squadron along with her sister ships and the newest Wittelsbach @-@ class battleships , while the older Brandenburg @-@ class ships were placed in reserve in order to be rebuilt . The first quarter of 1903 followed the usual pattern of training exercises . The squadron went on a training cruise in the Baltic , followed by a voyage to Spain that lasted from 7 May to 10 June . In July , she joined the I Squadron for the annual cruise to Norway . The autumn maneuvers consisted of a blockade exercise in the North Sea , a cruise of the entire fleet first to Norwegian waters and then to Kiel in early September , and finally a mock attack on Kiel . The exercises concluded on 12 September . The winter training cruise began on 23 November in the eastern Baltic and continued into the Skagerrak in early December . 
 Kaiser Karl der Grosse participated in an exercise in the Skagerrak from 11 to 21 January 1904 . Squadron exercises followed from 8 to 17 March . A major fleet exercise took place in the North Sea in May . In July , the I Squadron and the I Scouting Group visited Britain , including a stop at Plymouth on 10 July . The German fleet departed on 13 July , bound for the Netherlands ; the I Squadron anchored in Vlissingen the following day . There , the ships were visited by Queen Wilhelmina . The I Squadron remained in Vlissingen until 20 July , when they departed for a cruise in the northern North Sea with the rest of the fleet . The squadron stopped in Molde , Norway , on 29 July , while the other units went to other ports . The fleet reassembled on 6 August and steamed back to Kiel , where it conducted a mock attack on the harbor on 12 August . Immediately after returning to Kiel , the fleet began preparations for the autumn maneuvers , which began on 29 August in the Baltic . The fleet moved to the North Sea on 3 September , where it took part in a major landing operation , after which the ships took the ground troops from the IX Corps that participated in the exercises to Altona for a parade for Wilhelm II . The ships then conducted their own parade for the Kaiser off the island of Helgoland on 6 September . Three days later , the fleet returned to the Baltic via the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal , where it participated in further landing operations with the IX Corps and the Guards Corps . On 15 September , the maneuvers came to an end . The I Squadron went on its winter training cruise , this time to the eastern Baltic , from 22 November to 2 December . 
 = = = 1905 – 14 = = = 
 In January and February 1905 , Kaiser Karl der Grosse served briefly as the flagship of the squadron . During this period , she took part in a pair of training cruises with the I Squadron during 9 – 19 January and 27 February – 16 March 1905 . Individual and squadron training followed , with an emphasis on gunnery drills . On 12 July , the fleet began a major training exercise in the North Sea . While on the cruise on 18 July , Kaiser Karl der Grosse was detached to visit Antwerp to represent Germany during the celebrations for the 75th anniversary of the Belgian Revolution . The rest of the fleet then cruised through the Kattegat and stopped in Copenhagen and Stockholm ; Kaiser Karl der Grosse rejoined them on 3 August in Karlskrona . The summer cruise ended on 9 August , though the autumn maneuvers that would normally have begun shortly thereafter were delayed by a visit from the British Channel Fleet that month . 
 The British fleet stopped in Danzig , Swinemünde , and Flensburg , where it was greeted by units of the German Navy ; Kaiser Karl der Grosse and the main German fleet was anchored at Swinemünde for the occasion . The visit was strained by the growing Anglo @-@ German naval arms race . As a result of the British visit , the 1905 autumn maneuvers ( 6 to 13 September ) were shortened considerably , consisting only of exercises in the North Sea . The first exercise presumed a naval blockade in the German Bight , and the second envisioned a hostile fleet attempting to force the defenses of the Elbe . In November , the I Squadron cruised in the Baltic . In early December , the I and II Squadrons went on their regular winter cruise , this time to Danzig , where they arrived on 12 December . While on the return trip to Kiel , the fleet conducted tactical exercises . 
 The fleet undertook a heavier training schedule in 1906 than in previous years . The ships were occupied with individual , division and squadron exercises throughout April . Starting on 13 May , major fleet exercises took place in the North Sea and lasted until 8 June with a cruise around the Skagen into the Baltic . The fleet began its usual summer cruise to Norway in mid @-@ July . Kaiser Karl der Grosse and the I Squadron anchored in Molde , where they were joined on 21 July by Wilhelm II aboard the steamer SS Hamburg . The fleet was present for the birthday of Norwegian King Haakon VII on 3 August . The German ships departed the following day for Helgoland , to join exercises being conducted there . The fleet was back in Kiel by 15 August , where preparations for the autumn maneuvers began . On 22 – 24 August , the fleet took part in landing exercises in Eckernförde Bay outside Kiel . The maneuvers were paused from 31 August to 3 September when the fleet hosted vessels from Denmark and Sweden , along with a Russian squadron from 3 to 9 September in Kiel . The maneuvers resumed on 8 September and lasted five more days . 
 The ship participated in the uneventful winter cruise into the Kattegat and Skagerrak from 8 to 16 December . The first quarter of 1907 followed the previous pattern and , on 16 February , the Active <unk> was re @-@ designated the High Seas Fleet . From the end of May to early June the fleet went on its summer cruise in the North Sea , returning to the Baltic via the Kattegat . This was followed by the regular cruise to Norway from 12 July to 10 August . During the autumn maneuvers , which lasted from 26 August to 6 September , the fleet conducted landing exercises in northern Schleswig with the IX Corps . The winter training cruise went into the Kattegat from 22 to 30 November . In May 1908 , the fleet went on a major cruise into the Atlantic instead of its normal voyage in the North Sea . The fleet returned to Kiel on 13 August to prepare for the autumn maneuvers , which lasted from 27 August to 7 September . Division exercises in the Baltic immediately followed from 7 to 13 September . Following the conclusion of these maneuvers on 18 September , Kaiser Karl der Grosse was decommissioned in Kiel and assigned to the Reserve Division in the Baltic . During this period , her sister ships were rebuilt , though Kaiser Karl der Grosse did not receive this treatment . In June and July 1911 , the ship underwent a major overhaul . By 1914 , the ship had been assigned to the V Squadron of the Reserve Fleet , alongside her four sister ships and the battleship Wettin . 
 = = = World War I = = = 
 As a result of the outbreak of World War I , Kaiser Karl der Grosse and her sisters were brought out of reserve and mobilized as the V Battle Squadron on 5 August 1914 . The ships were prepared for war very slowly , and they were not ready for service in the North Sea until the end of August . They were initially tasked with coastal defense , though they served in this capacity for a very short time . In mid @-@ September , the V Squadron was transferred to the Baltic , under the command of Prince Heinrich . He initially planned to launch a major amphibious assault on Windau , but a shortage of transports forced a revision of the plan . Instead , the V Squadron was to carry the landing force , but this too was cancelled after Heinrich received false reports of British warships having entered the Baltic on 25 September . Kaiser Karl der Grosse and her sisters returned to Kiel the following day , disembarked the landing force , and then proceeded to the North Sea , where they resumed guard ship duties . Before the end of the year , the V Squadron was once again transferred to the Baltic . 
 Prince Heinrich ordered a foray toward Gotland . On 26 December 1914 , the battleships rendezvoused with the Baltic cruiser division in the Bay of Pomerania and then departed on the sortie . Two days later , the fleet arrived off Gotland to show the German flag , and was back in Kiel by 30 December . Kaiser Karl der Grosse briefly replaced her sister Kaiser Wilhelm II as the squadron flagship , from 23 January 1915 to 23 February . The squadron returned to the North Sea for guard duties , but was withdrawn from front @-@ line service by February . Shortages of trained crews in the High Seas Fleet , coupled with the risk of operating older ships in wartime , necessitated the deactivation of Kaiser der Grosse and her sisters . Starting in October , she served briefly as a training ship for engine room personnel , though on 19 November she was decommissioned in Kiel and disarmed . She was thereafter employed as a prison ship for prisoners of war in Wilhelmshaven . In November 1918 , Germany capitulated and signed the First Armistice at Compiègne , which ended hostilities so a peace treaty could be negotiated . According to Article 181 of the Treaty of Versailles , signed on 28 June 1919 , Germany was permitted to retain only six battleships of the " Deutschland or Lothringen types " . On 6 December 1919 , the ship was struck from the naval list and sold to ship @-@ breakers . The following year , Kaiser Karl der Grosse was broken up for scrap metal in Rönnebeck . 
 = Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin = 
 Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin is a large 15th @-@ century oil and tempera on oak panel painting , usually dated between 1435 and 1440 , attributed to the Early Netherlandish painter Rogier van der Weyden . Housed in the Museum of Fine Arts , Boston , it shows Luke the Evangelist , patron saint of artists , sketching the Virgin Mary as she nurses the Child Jesus . The figures are positioned in a bourgeois interior which leads out towards a courtyard , river , town and landscape . The enclosed garden , illusionistic carvings of Adam and Eve on the arms of Mary 's throne , and attributes of St Luke are amongst the painting 's many iconographic symbols . 
 Van der Weyden was strongly influenced by Jan van Eyck , and the painting is very similar to the earlier Madonna of Chancellor Rolin , usually dated to around 1434 , with significant differences . The figure 's positioning and colourisation are reversed , and Luke takes centre stage ; his face is accepted as van der Weyden 's self @-@ portrait . Three near contemporary versions are in the Hermitage Museum , Saint Petersburg , the Alte Pinakothek , Munich , and the <unk> , Bruges . The Boston panel is widely considered the original from underdrawings that are both heavily reworked and absent in other versions . It is in relatively poor condition , having suffered considerable damage , which remains despite extensive restoration and cleaning . 
 The painting 's historical significance rests both on the skill behind the design and its merging of earthly and divine realms . By positioning himself in the same space as the Madonna , and showing a painter in the act of portrayal , Van der Weyden brings to the fore the role of artistic creativity in 15th @-@ century society . The panel became widely influential with near copies by the Master of the Legend of Saint Ursula and Hugo van der Goes . 
 = = Commission = = 
 There are no surviving contemporary archival documents for Rogier van der Weyden 's Saint Luke Drawing the Virgin , but art historians agree that it was almost certainly painted for the Brussels painters ' guild , for their chapel at the Cathedral of St. Michael and St. <unk> , where van der Weyden is buried . It may have been commissioned to celebrate the artist 's appointment as city painter for Brussels . Luke the Evangelist was thought to have been a portraitist , and Northern European painters ' guilds were considered to be under his protection . 
 In the 15th @-@ century images of Luke painting the Virgin were more commonly found in Northern rather than Italian art . Luke was credited with painting the original of the immensely popular Italo @-@ Byzantine Cambrai Madonna , to which numerous miracles were attributed . The original of that work was taken to France from Rome in 1440 , and within four years at least 15 high quality copies had been made . It was regarded as an example of St Luke 's skill , and contemporary painters strove to emulate him in their depictions of Mary . Popular belief held that the essence of the Virgin was captured in Luke 's portrait of her . 
 = = After van Eyck = = 
 Van der Weyden closely follows van Eyck 's c . 1435 Madonna of Chancellor Rolin , though there are significant differences . The landscape in the van der Weyden is less detailed , and its top gives less of an illusion of openness than van Eyck 's . The most obvious similarity is the two figures standing at a bridge , who may not carry specific identities ; those in the van der Weyden are sometimes identified as Joachim and Anne , the Virgin 's parents . In van Eyck 's painting the right hand figure wears a red turban , a motif widely accepted as that artist 's indicator of a self @-@ portrait ; similar images can be found on the London Portrait of a Man and the reflection in the knight 's shield in the Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele , Bruges . 
 In the van der Weyden , the positioning of the main figures is reversed from the van Eyck ; the Virgin appears to the left , a positioning that became predominate in later Netherlandish diptychs . The colours in this work are warmer than those in the van Eyck . Van der Weyden switches the colours of their costumes ; Luke is dressed in red or scarlet , Mary in the more typical warm blues . The Virgin type has further been changed , here she is depicted as a Maria Lactans ( " Nursing Madonna " ) . This is one of the standard depictions of her , different from the Hodegetria ( Our Lady of the Way , or She who points the way ) Virgin type most usually associated with Byzantine and Northern 15th @-@ century depictions of St Luke . This depiction of Mary 's motherhood stresses the " redemption of mankind by Christ as human ... [ and ] spiritual nourishing " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The panel comprises four individual pieces of oak , painted over a chalk ground bound with glue . The preparation wood is dated to around 1410 , giving an estimated date for the Van der Weyden in the mid @-@ 1430s . The dominant pigments are lead white ( often used in the panel to highlight blue and green passages ) , charcoal black , ultramarine , lead @-@ tin @-@ yellow , verdigris and red lake . There has been some discolouration – some greens are now brown , including pigments used to depict grass in the background . 
 Mary sits under a brocade canopy or cloth of honour , painted in brown hues which have since discoloured to dark green . The canopy hangs down to a wooden bench attached to the wall behind her . Mary 's hair is loose and she wears an embroidered dress lined with fur . Around her neck is a light veil , and she is shown in the act of nursing . Her dress is a centrepiece of the panel , composed of a variety of blues overlaid with lead white and deep blue lapis lazuli highlights . The inner parts of her robe contain violet coloured fabrics , lined with greyish blues and purples . 
 Luke is positioned on a green cushion , between the heavenly figure and the small study behind him . He is either rising from a kneeling position or about to <unk> . His eyes fix on her attentively , and he seems near hypnotised . Jesus is similarly transfixed . Hall describes Luke 's hands as floating before him , holding the tools " with the same delicacy that an angel might hold a lily or sceptre " . Mary has turned her face so that he can depict her in near full profile , a rare honour , while Luke 's kneeling position is closely analogous to that of a typical donor portrait in the presence of the Virgin . 
 Luke is beardless and in his early 40s , close to van der Weyden 's age in the mid @-@ 1430s . His face is not idealised ; he is middle @-@ aged with light stubble and greying hair . The room behind him contains his attributes including an ox and an open book representing his Gospel . He is painted with more naturalism than Mary ; his eyes in particular are more realistically drawn . Christ 's conform to the then idealised form , as simple crescents . Mary 's are formed from curved lines typical of late Gothic ideals of feminine beauty . Compared to contemporary paintings of this type , the work is unusually free of inscriptions ; they appear only on items in Luke 's study , dimly perceived on his right : on a book , on an ink bottle , and on a scroll emanating from the mouth of his ox , beneath the small desk . 
 The scene is set within a rather narrow interior space , with a barrel vault ceiling , patterned floor tilings , and stained glass windows . The outer wall opens to the midground , with a patch of grass and plants , and has a view of a river or inlet . Art historian Jeffrey Chipps Smith notes how the transition between the grounds establishes a " complex spatial space in which [ van der Weyden ] achieved an almost seamless movement from the elaborate architecture of the main room to the garden and parapet of the middle ground to the urban and rural landscape behind " . 
 Two figures in the mid @-@ ground stand at a battlement wall overlooking the water , their backs turned against the viewer , the male pointing outwards . They are framed by columns , and are looking towards the detailed city and landscape in the background . The figures seem preoccupied with " looking " , which Carol <unk> believes , to van der Weyden , was a form of devotionalism ; through meditating on an image , the " beholder experienced visions of transports of ecstasy " . Technical analysis shows that both figures were heavily reworked both in the underdrawing and the final painting ; the hood of the figure on the right was originally red , but over @-@ painted as black , amongst many other differences . 
 The positioning of these figures closely resembles that of two persons depicted in the van Eyck panel . In that painting the right @-@ hand figure turns to face his companion , gesturing at him to look outwards . In the van der Weyden , the equivalent figure seems protective of his friend , who here is female , while the left @-@ hand figure in the earlier panel might represent a tribute to the artist 's brother Hubert who had died in the 1420s . A red headdress was an indicator of self @-@ portraiture for van Eyck . As in the van Eyck , the figures act as examples of <unk> , in that they draw our attention to the picture 's underlying theme – the painting 's ability to visualize the infinity of the world in the landscape . The painting may allude to the concept of <unk> ; the man points to the landscape , perhaps highlighting the ability of painting , unlike sculpture , to supply its foreground with background . 
 Examination of the underdrawing shows that the artist intended a van Eyckian angel crowning the Virgin , but this was omitted from the final painting . He heavily reworked the positions of the three main figures even towards the end of completion . The draperies of the mantles were at first larger . Christ 's body at first faced Luke , but was later tilted in the direction of his mother . The mother and child were brought closer together . Luke 's head was at first level with the Virgin 's , but in the final painting is raised slightly above . The differences extend beyond those in the foreground . The fortifications of the inner courtyard have been enlarged , while the two figures looking out over the river were smaller , the river itself narrower . 
 = = Self @-@ portrait = = 
 Luke 's face is widely considered to be a van der Weyden self @-@ portrait . He may have wanted to associate himself both with a saint and with the founder of painting . This is reinforced by the fact that Luke is shown drawing in silverpoint on white paper ; an extremely difficult medium that demands high concentration , and is normally used only for preparation . The artist is boldly emphasising his ability and skill with preparatory sketches ; a single surviving silverpoint drawing attributed to van der Weyden , now in the Louvre , contains a female head very similar to Mary 's in the Boston panel . 
 Van der Weyden appears intelligent and handsome , but weather @-@ worn . He inserted a self @-@ portrait into one other work ; the lost Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald , known through a tapestry copy in the Historical Museum of Bern . Later northern artists followed his lead , using self @-@ portraits in their own depictions of Luke . 
 What biographical details are available place the artist as a devout Catholic , deeply influenced by mystical and devotional texts , familiar with 12th and 13th century female theologians such as Mechthild of Magdeburg and Hildegard of Bingen . They believed that contemplating devotional images whilst meditating might lead to a vision or a state of ecstasy . It is possible from these teachings that van der Weyden developed a set of devotional motifs such as The Magdalen Reading . The importance of St Luke in Christian art is underscored in St Luke Painting the Virgin , while affirming " the role of art within the context of meditation and contemplation . " 
 The self @-@ portraiture achieves a number of purposes . It acts as a tribute to his own ability , as a measure of his skill against van Eyck , and as a case for the legitimacy of the craft of painting . By portraying himself as St Luke in the act of drawing rather than painting , De Vries believes van der Weyden reveals an " artistic consciousness by commenting upon artistic traditions and by doing so presents a visual argument for the role and function of the artist and his art , one at that time still predominantly religiously defined . " 
 Smith describes the panel as an " exposition of the art of painting " , observing that van der Weyden records the essential skills any successful artist should master while claiming to be an heir to St Luke . He works in silverpoint – and thus is unencumbered with the paraphernalia of painting ; an easel , seat or other items which might clutter the composition , or more importantly place a physical barrier between the divine and earthly realms . 
 = = Iconography = = 
 The painting is rich in both actual and implied iconography . Van der Weyden presents Mary as the Maria Lactans virgin type , a symbol of " Mother Church " especially popular at times of plague or famine , the implication being that she cares for all and no one will go hungry . This notion ties in with Luke 's dual roles of physician ( and thus healer ) and artist . Van der Weyden had earlier portrayed Mary breast @-@ feeding in his Virgin and Child Enthroned , which depicts equally detailed carvings carrying significance , but is reduced in size and in its cast of characters , and omits the act of beholding . 
 The architecture of the enclosed space suggests a church . The Virgin sits beneath a canopy , perhaps symbolic of the sacred space , and the spatial separation between the celebrant and the congregation , usually by a Rood screen . The small room to the right could symbolize the vesting chamber . The arms of her throne are painted as carved with figures including Adam , Eve and the serpent before the fall from Paradise . The room faces towards an enclosed garden , another emblem of the Virgin 's chastity . Though Mary is positioned by a throne and under a canopy , indicating her role as Queen of Heaven , she sits on the step , an indication of her humility . 
 The Virgin occupies an earthly space as opposed to a sacred one , but remains aloof . This approach is emphasised by secondary midground figures who are out in the open air , while the main figures are positioned in an elevated room containing a throne , grand arches and wood carvings . Van der Weyden 's setting is less artificial than van Eyck 's ; here Luke and Mary face each other as equals , rather than in van Eyck 's painting where , as Blum describes " a divinity and a mortal " face one another . Van der Weyden omits the winged angel holding a crown hovering above the Virgin ; the figure was included in the underdrawings , but eventually abandoned . The landscape is more secular than van Eyck 's , which is dominated by church spires . 
 In the late @-@ 13th century , many of the newly emerging painter 's guilds were nominating Luke as their patron saint . The van der Weyden panel is among the first known depictions of St Luke painting the Virgin in Northern Renaissance art , along with a similar work , a lost triptych panel by Robert Campin . Van der Weyden presents a humanised Virgin and Child , as suggested by the realistic contemporary surroundings , the lack of halos , and the intimate spatial construction . Yet he infuses the panel with extensive religious iconography . 
 = = Attribution and dating = = 
 During the 19th century the painting was at times associated with Quentin Massys and Hugo van der Goes . In the early 1930s , based on x @-@ radiographs , art historian Alan Burroughs attributed the Boston painting to Dieric Bouts " under the supervision " of van der Weyden . He later revised his opinion to van der Weyden , but art historians remained unsure as to which of the four panel versions was the original or prime version and which were copies . Infrared reflectography has revealed underdrawing in the Boston version which contains heavy redrafting and re @-@ working . This is absent in the other versions , strong evidence the Boston panel is prime . The approach to the underdrawing is very similar to the paintings where attribution to van der Weyden is established , such as the Descent from the Cross in Madrid , and the Miraflores Altarpiece in Berlin . They are built up with brush and ink , with the most attention given to the outlines of the figures and draperies . Hatching is used to indicate areas of deep shadow . In each , the underdrawing is a working sketch , subject to constant revisions , which continued even after painting had begun . The drawing of Mary is similar to the Louvre 's silverpoint drawing of 1464 attributed to his circle . Both are of a type van der Weyden was preoccupied with , showing " an ongoing refinement and emphasis on [ Mary 's ] youthfulness ... [ which is ] traceable throughout his work " . 
 Art historians gradually revised their dating from 1450 to the currently accepted 1435 – 40 , earlier in the artist 's career . This estimate is based on three factors ; the dating of the Rolin Madonna , van der Weyden 's opportunity of viewing that panel , and his ability to produce his own work after such a viewing . He is known to have visited Brussels – where van Eyck kept his studio – in 1432 and again 1435 . Erwin Panofsky suggested c . 1434 as the earliest possible date , and that the Rolin panel was completed in 1433 or 1434 . Julius Held was sceptical of this early dating , noting that if true we are " forced to assume that within one year of Jan 's work Rogier received a commission which gave him an opportunity to adopt Jan 's compositional pattern while subjecting it at the same time to a very thorough and highly personal transformation , and all this in Bruges , under Jan 's very eyes " . 
 Held , as a lone voice and writing in 1955 , argues for a date between 1440 and 1443 , seeing the work as more advanced than other paintings by the artist from the mid @-@ 1430s , and believes it contains " considerable differences " when compared to other early works , especially the Annunciation Triptych of c . 1434 . He further observes that although the painting became highly influential , copies did not appear until the mid @-@ century . 
 Dendrochronological examination of the growth rings in the panel 's wood suggests that the timber was felled around 1410 . In the 15th century , wood was typically stored for around 20 years before use in panel painting , giving an earliest date in the mid to late 1430s . Analysis of the Munich version places it in the 1480s , around 20 years after van der Weyden 's death . The panel in Bruges is in the best condition and of exceptional quality , but dates from c . 1491 – 1510 . 
 = = Provenance and conservation = = 
 Despite the eminence of the painting and its many copies , little is known of its provenance before the 19th century . It seems likely that it is the painting Albrecht Dürer mentions in his diary recollection of his visit to the Low Countries in 1520 . It is probably the same work recorded in an 1574 inventory of Philip II , kept at the Escorial . The painting is recorded in 1835 in the collection of Don Infante Sebastián Gabriel <unk> y Braganza , a grandnephew of Charles III of Spain and himself an artist . Gabriel 's inventory notes described the panel in detail , attributed it to Lucas van Leyden , and suggested an earlier restoration . It was donated to the Museum of Fine Arts in 1893 by Henry Lee Higginson after his purchase at a New York auction in 1889 . Photographs from 1914 show it in an ornate , decorative frame which is probably the same as in Gabriel 's 1835 description . 
 The panel is in poor condition , with substantial damage to its frame and surface , despite at least four restorations . The earliest recorded restoration was in 1893 , the year it was acquired by the Museum of Fine Arts , but there are no surviving records of the treatment . In the early 1930s , the museum 's curator of paintings , Philip Henry , described the painting as an original van der Weyden , but gave the opinion that its poor condition was hindering wider acceptance of the attribution . On this basis , it was sent to Germany in 1932 to undergo conservation . The effort was led by the restorer Helmut Ruhemann , who described the panel as " structurally sound " , and removed layers of discoloured varnish and " crude overpainting " , while filling in some areas of paint loss . Ruhemann believed he had found evidence of at least two major 19th @-@ century restorations , one of which was probably that carried out in Boston in 1893 . Ruhemann 's cleaning and restoration was widely praised , and contributed to the acceptance of the panel as the original by van der Weyden . 
 The MFA undertook a third restoration in 1943 , when some yellowing of the glaze was repaired . Most recently , the painting was cleaned in 1980 when small amounts of grime were removed , some losses were filled in , and a light coat of varnish was applied . 
 = = Influence = = 
 The painting established van der Weyden as a progenitor and " inventor [ of ] authoritative models ... at the foundation of Netherlandish art " . If it was in the Guild of Saint Luke 's chapel in Brussels , then many near @-@ contemporary artists would have been able to view it . Van der Weyden 's interpretation was hugely influential during the mid @-@ 15th and early @-@ 16th centuries , both in free and faithful adaptations and copies , examples of which are in Brussels , Kassel , Valladolid and Barcelona . This reflects its quality , and the fact that he presents an ideal image of an artist as a self @-@ portrait , legitimising and elevating the trade . Also influential was his Madonna type , which he used again for the c . 1450 Diptych of Jean de Gros . That painting features a ' Virgin and Child ' wing directly modelled on his St Luke panel , extending the devotional aspect to include a donor who appears in the same panel with her . In combining the patron with the Virgin , the " artist has made that personal devotion an integral part of the image . " 
 Depictions of Luke drawing the Virgin rose in popularity in the mid @-@ to @-@ late 15th century , with van der Weyden 's panel the earliest known from the Low Countries – Campin 's earlier treatment was by then lost . Most were free copies ( adaptations ) of van der Weyden 's design . The anonymous painter known as the Master of the Legend of St. Ursula incorporated the Maria Lactans type for his Virgin and Child , now in New York . Other artists producing works directly influenced by van der Weyden 's portrait include Hugo van der Goes , Dieric Bouts , Derick <unk> and Jan Gossaert . Some artists copied van der Weyden by placing their own likeness in place of St Luke , notably Simon Marmion and Maarten van Heemskerck . By representing themselves as Luke , artists implied a depiction of the Virgin based on first hand contact and thus giving her true likeness . 
 Van der Goes 's is the earliest extant autographed version , and one of the most important . This panel was originally a diptych wing of which the accompanying panel of the Virgin and Child is lost , and was probably made for a guild . Luke is dressed in a heavy red robe , draws a preparatory sketch in silverpoint , and wears a melancholy expression . Building on van der Weyden 's theme of the role , practice and craft of an artist , van der Goes places pieces of charcoal , a knife and the feathers of a small bird in front of the saint . The similarities to the van der Weyden are many and striking , and include the painting utensils , red robes , physician 's cap and blue mantle . The figure has the same middle @-@ aged facial type and his pose , kneeling on a green cushion , although reversed compared to van der Weyden 's , is the same . Van der Goes 's adaption both increased van der Weyden 's standing in the eyes of the later artist 's followers , and led to a new group of copies that were modelled on the later painting . 
 A tapestry version woven in Brussels c . 1500 is now in the Louvre . It was probably designed using a reversed drawing of the painting .

 = Michigan State Capitol = 
 The Michigan State Capitol is the building housing the legislative branch of the government of the U.S. state of Michigan . It is located in the portion of the state capital of Lansing which lies in Ingham County . The present structure , at the intersection of Capitol and Michigan Avenues , is a National Historic Landmark that currently houses the chambers and offices of the Michigan Legislature as well as the ceremonial offices of the Governor of Michigan and Lieutenant Governor . Historically , this is the third building to house the Michigan government . 
 The first state capitol was located in Detroit , the original capital of Michigan , and was relocated to Lansing in 1847 , due to the need to develop the western portions of the state and for easy defense from British troops stationed in Windsor , Ontario . The present capitol building , preceded by a temporary wood frame structure , was dedicated in January 1879 , and is designed in a Neoclassical style , more specifically the Italianate style . The capitol was rededicated in 1992 after a three @-@ year restoration project .

 On July 13 , 1787 , the Second Continental Congress passed the Northwest Ordinance , creating the Northwest Territory which included Michigan . In 1805 , the U.S. Congress created the Michigan Territory , with Detroit as its territorial capital . Michigan first applied for statehood as early as 1832 , though it was rebuffed due to a dispute with Ohio over the Toledo Strip , a 468 @-@ square mile ( 1 @,@ 210 km ² ) area that included the important port city of Toledo . By 1835 , Michigan had formed a state government without receiving authorization from Congress to do so . The boundaries of the state included the contested area . 
 The dispute culminated in what has become known as the Toledo War , as Michigan and Ohio militia took up arms in the area . As a condition for entering the Union , Michigan was forced to accept the western three quarters of the Upper Peninsula in exchange for ceding its claim to the Toledo Strip . After a state convention first rejected this condition , a second convention , assembled under some duress in December 1836 , reluctantly accepted the terms and Michigan became the 26th state on January 26 , 1837 , with Detroit as its first capital . 
 The first building to serve as the State Capitol was built in 1832 as the Territorial Courthouse . The court house was located on the corner of Griswold Street and State Street . This brick structure was one of the earliest Greek revival buildings in Michigan , with a portico of Ionic columns and a central tower of 140 feet ( 42 m ) . Built at a cost of $ 24 @,@ 500 ( $ 580 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) , the building housed the territorial government and state legislatures until 1848 , when a hastily erected wood building was constructed in Lansing following a decision made March 17 , 1847 , to move the capital from Detroit to Lansing . The Detroit building then became a public school ( the Union School , at one time the city 's only high school ) and library until it burned in 1893 .

 The seat of government for this state shall be at Detroit , or at such other place or places as may be prescribed by law until the year eighteen hundred and forty @-@ seven , when it shall be permanently located by the legislature . 
 Prior to 1847 , Detroit fought to maintain the capitol within its jurisdiction , but communities in the growing western part of the state had many reasons for wanting a move inland , including the need to increase defensibility by moving the state government away from the Canadian border . Detroit had been occupied during the War of 1812 , and the border area of Michigan of less than a mile between Detroit and Windsor , Ontario , at the Detroit River continued to be occupied by British troops on both banks . Proponents of moving the capitol also sought to promote settlement and the economy in the interior , as well as making the government more accessible to the people throughout the state . 
 Contenders seeking designation as the new capitol included Ann Arbor , Jackson , Grand Rapids , and Shiawassee Township in Shiawassee County . At one point during the debate , Marshall officials were so certain of its selection that they built a governor 's mansion . After extensive debate , State Senator Joseph H. <unk> of Ingham County proposed that the nearly uninhabited Lansing Township be made the seat of government . The legislature agreed , with the location north of Ann Arbor , west of Detroit , and east of Grand Rapids being deemed a suitable compromise . The legislature renamed it as the Town of Michigan , though by 1848 the original name of Lansing was restored . 
 Construction began in 1847 on the state capitol building in Lansing , a temporary structure on the block bordered by Washington Avenue , Capitol Avenue , Allegan Street , and Washtenaw Street . It was a simple two @-@ story wood frame structure , painted white with green wooden shutters and topped by a tin cupola . The total cost for construction was $ 22 @,@ 952 @.@ 01 ( $ 580 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) . The building was sold when the permanent capitol building opened in 1879 . It was then used as a factory until , like the first capitol , it was destroyed by a fire in 1882 .

 In the early 1870s , Governor Henry P. Baldwin urged the legislature to fund a new , permanent capitol . On March 31 , 1871 , a bill was adopted " for the erection of a new state capitol , and a building for the temporary use of the state officers . " The new capitol was to cost $ 1 @.@ 2 million ( $ 24 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) , to be raised by a six @-@ year state income tax . 
 In 1872 , architect Elijah E. Myers of Springfield , Illinois , was commissioned to design the new capitol building and the design committee selected his design named <unk> , which means I will defend . Myers used the central dome and wing design found in the United States Capitol in his design and subsequently went on to design two other state capitol buildings , the <unk> of Colorado and Texas , as well as the former territorial capitol building of Idaho , the most by any architect . The cornerstone was laid on October 2 , 1873 , with about 7 @,@ 000 Lansing residents and some 30 @,@ 000 to 50 @,@ 000 visitors attending . Construction and finishing work were completed by late 1878 . The new capitol , with 139 rooms , was dedicated at the same time as the inauguration of Governor Charles Croswell January 1 , 1879 . 
 The Lansing capitol building inspired a national trend after the American Civil War for fireproof buildings , large enough to house expanding government as well as serving as a durable repository for artifacts of the war , including battle flags that were subsequently moved to the Michigan Historical Museum in 1990 . Over the years the dome , which at first matched the light tan of the building , was repainted a bright white . The legislature funded an extensive historical restoration starting in 1989 which was completed in 1992 . The restoration returned the dome to a creamy @-@ white shade , upgraded mechanical systems , and improved accessibility as well as restoring many of the original design elements . One of the largest phases of the restoration entailed removal of " half @-@ floors " that were installed in 1969 to create 50 @,@ 000 square feet ( 4 @,@ 600 m2 ) of additional office space . The floors were created by dividing the 16 @-@ foot ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) -high rooms horizontally and creating a level of rooms which was accessed from the stairway landing . The Capitol Building was listed on the National Register of Historic Places January 25 , 1971 ( NRHP Reference # <unk> ) , and was designated as a National Historic Landmark October 5 , 1992 .

 The Michigan State Capitol is 267 ft ( 81 m ) from the ground to the tip of finial / spire above the dome . The building is 420 ft 2 in ( 128 @.@ 07 m ) long and 273 ft 11 in ( 83 @.@ 49 m ) wide ( including approaches ) . The capitol occupies 1 @.@ 16 acres ( 4 @,@ 700 m2 ) , has a perimeter of 1 @,@ 520 ft ( 460 m ) . The structure contains four stories , with public entrances on the ground floor . Two grand staircases in the north and south corridors go up to the top floor . The rotunda measures 44 @.@ 5 feet ( 13 @.@ 6 m ) in diameter and 160 feet ( 49 m ) in height measured from the floor to the oculus . 
 When it opened , the Capitol structure was large enough to host all the state agencies and departments . Due to the growth of state government , however , only the offices of Senate and House leadership , and ceremonial offices for the governor and lieutenant governor remain in the capitol . The ground floor corridors led to " store rooms " designed by the architect in the original building plans . This includes an armory in the southwest corner of the south corridor . The original wood floor has been replaced by gray tiles . The rooms were originally lit with gas fixtures , though by 1900 , the entire building had been refitted with electric lights . Today the ground floor is home to several offices , including the Secretary of the Senate , the Clerk of the House , and the Capitol Tours and Information Service . 
 Starting with the first floor and continuing to the third , black and white floor tiling is made of Vermont marble and limestone . The exception is the floor of the rotunda which is composed of 976 blocks of translucent glass . The blocks vary in size so that when viewed from the upper floors , they appear to form a bowl which mirrors the dome above . The doorknobs are mostly made of a brass and bronze alloy ( most of the original brass doorknobs have disappeared over time ) . The present doorknobs and hinges , locked for protection , display the state coat of arms . Though the building appears to have walnut woodwork , the wood is actually Michigan white pine that has been wood @-@ grained to give the appearance of walnut . 
 The first floor gives visitors their first view of the interior of the rotunda . Below the cast @-@ iron dome , the ceiling displays eight muses painted in 1886 . For more than a century , the muses ' artist remained anonymous ; it is now known that it was Tommaso <unk> , who created them in his Boston studio and never came to Michigan . In the east wing of the first floor is a large clock , called a long @-@ drop clock . It was once the building 's master clock and is at least as old as the Capitol . The clock was restored in 1990 and is currently in working condition . 
 The second floor , in addition to housing the gubernatorial offices , features the Gallery of Governors with portraits of former Michigan Governors on the walls of the rotunda ; the gallery extends up to the third floor . The governor 's offices were among the most extensively restored during the 1989 – 1992 restoration . The office features a suite of original furnishings manufactured in 1876 by the Feige Brothers Company of Saginaw . The former chambers of the Michigan Supreme Court are located in the south wing of the building . The court vacated its chambers in 1970 for larger quarters , eventually moving to its current location in the Michigan Hall of Justice . The room is now used by the Senate Appropriations Committee and named for longtime chairman Harry Gast . 
 Public access to Michigan 's legislative bodies is through the third floor . The capitol building holds the chambers and offices of the bicameral state legislature , which is composed of the Michigan House of Representatives and Michigan Senate . Public galleries are at both ends of the third floor . The Senate , with 38 members , has its chambers on the south side of the building , while the House of Representatives , with 110 members , has its chambers in the north wing . House sessions are normally held on Tuesdays and Wednesdays at 1 : 00 PM and Thursdays at 10 : 30 AM , while Senate sessions begin at 10 : 00 AM on Tuesdays , Wednesdays , and Thursdays . Both houses occasionally convene on Mondays and Fridays . Senate and House sessions are taped by Michigan Government Television , a public service body transmitted to local cable television systems ' government @-@ access television channels . Similar to C @-@ SPAN , <unk> has made live coverage of the legislative proceedings available since July 15 , 1996 . 
 Although having the same floor plan , the House and Senate chambers are decorated very differently , with the former in terra cotta and teal colors and the latter in blue and gold . An oval cartouche in the carpet at the entrance to the House chamber features the state flower , the apple blossom . Presiding over the house is the speaker , whose chair is behind a desk in the center with a plaster and paint version of the state coat of arms . The Senate chamber is somewhat smaller than the House . The president of the Senate is the lieutenant governor , who presides over sessions from a walnut rostrum at the front of the chamber . Both the House and the Senate use computerized voting systems , including wall @-@ mounted screens that allow visitors to follow the voting and both also contain glass tiled ceilings that allow natural light to shine through etched glass panels to better light the room . These ceiling tiles feature the coats @-@ of @-@ arms of each state in the United States . 
 In summer 2013 , the structure underwent additional work to replace carpeting installed in the 1989 @-@ 1992 renovation that had become worn and frayed in many areas . Work also upgraded wiring for communications systems , repaired roof leaks and upgraded a handicapped parking area and entrance on the north side .

 The Capitol <unk> , located above the main front entrance to the building , is entitled " The Rise and Progress of Michigan . " It depicts a central figure , Michigan , who is dressed as a Native American . She offers a book and globe to the people of her state , promising a bright future . She is surrounded by symbols of Michigan 's economy , including a plow , cornucopia , and a laurel wreath to represent agriculture . Also included are symbols representing shipping , mining , and lumbering . 
 The cornerstone , located at the northeast corner of the building , bears the dates 1872 , the start of construction , and 1878 , the year of completion . The stone was opened during ceremonies November 15 , 1978 , the centennial of the building 's completion . Various documents enclosed within the stone had been damaged by moisture , although several coins from the era remained intact . Officials closed and resealed with stone with 38 new items depicting Michigan 's history , people , and lifestyles . At the southeast corner of the lawn is the Grand Army of the Republic Memorial , a 1924 @-@ bronze plaque attached to a boulder as a memorial to American Civil War veterans who fought for the Union . 
 Several notable trees are located on the grounds . An Eastern White Pine , the state tree of Michigan , is located at the east front of the building . The Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr . Tree was planted in memory of the slain leader in 1984 to the north of the Austin Blair Monument . The oldest tree on the grounds is a catalpa on the southeast lawn present when the Capitol was dedicated in 1873 . The American Forestry Association has certified that this catalpa is the largest living tree of its kind in the United States . The most recently dedicated tree is a blue spruce called " the Freedom Tree , " planted in 1973 as a memorial to the Vietnam War 's missing @-@ in @-@ action and prisoners of war . 
 = Istanbul = 
 Istanbul ( / <unk> / or / <unk> / or / <unk> / ; Turkish : İstanbul [ <unk> ] ) , historically known as Constantinople and Byzantium , is the most populous city in Turkey and the country 's economic , cultural , and historic center . Istanbul is a transcontinental city in Eurasia , straddling the Bosphorus strait ( which separates Europe and Asia ) between the Sea of Marmara and the Black Sea . Its commercial and historical center lies on the European side and about a third of its population lives on the Asian side . The city is the administrative center of the Istanbul Metropolitan Municipality ( coterminous with Istanbul Province ) , both hosting a population of around 14 @.@ 7 million residents . Istanbul is one of the world 's most populous cities and ranks as the world 's 8th @-@ largest city proper and the largest European city . 
 Founded under the name of Byzantium on the Sarayburnu promontory around 660 BCE , the city developed to become one of the most significant in history . After its reestablishment as Constantinople in 330 CE , it served as an imperial capital for almost 16 centuries , during the Roman and Byzantine ( 330 – 1204 and 1261 – 1453 ) , the Latin ( 1204 – 1261 ) , and the Ottoman ( 1453 – 1922 ) empires . It was instrumental in the advancement of Christianity during Roman and Byzantine times , before the Ottomans conquered the city in 1453 and transformed it into an Islamic stronghold and the seat of the Ottoman Caliphate . 
 Istanbul 's strategic position on the historic Silk Road , rail networks to Europe and the Middle East , and the only sea route between the Black Sea and the Mediterranean have produced a cosmopolitan populace , although less so since the establishment of the Turkish Republic in 1923 . Overlooked for the new capital Ankara during the interwar period , the city has since regained much of its prominence . The population of the city has increased tenfold since the 1950s , as migrants from across Anatolia have moved in and city limits have expanded to accommodate them . Arts , music , film , and cultural festivals were established at the end of the 20th century and continue to be hosted by the city today . Infrastructure improvements have produced a complex transportation network . 
 Approximately 12 @.@ 56 million foreign visitors arrived in Istanbul in 2015 , five years after it was named a European Capital of Culture , making the city the world 's fifth most popular tourist destination . The city 's biggest attraction is its historic center , partially listed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site , and its cultural and entertainment hub can be found across the city 's natural harbor , the Golden Horn , in the Beyoğlu district . Considered a global city , Istanbul has one of the fastest @-@ growing metropolitan economies in the world . It hosts the headquarters of many Turkish companies and media outlets and accounts for more than a quarter of the country 's gross domestic product . Hoping to capitalize on its revitalization and rapid expansion , Istanbul has bid for the Summer Olympics five times in twenty years . 
 = = Toponymy = = 
 The first known name of the city is Byzantium ( Greek : <unk> , <unk> ) , the name given to it at its foundation by <unk> colonists around 660 BCE . The name is thought to be derived from a personal name , Byzas . Ancient Greek tradition refers to a legendary king of that name as the leader of the Greek colonists . Modern scholars have also hypothesized that the name of Byzas was of local Thracian or Illyrian origin and hence predated the <unk> settlement . 
 After Constantine the Great made it the new eastern capital of the Roman Empire in 330 CE , the city became widely known as " <unk> " ( Constantinople ) , which , as the Latinized form of " <unk> " ( <unk> ) , means the " City of Constantine " . He also attempted to promote the name " Nova Roma " and its Greek version " <unk> <unk> " Nea <unk> ( New Rome ) , but this did not enter widespread usage . Constantinople remained the most common name for the city in the West until the establishment of the Turkish Republic , and <unk> ( Ottoman Turkish <unk> ) and Be <unk> @-@ e <unk> al @-@ <unk> ( meaning " the Protected Location of Constantinople " ) and İstanbul were the names used alternatively by the Ottomans during their rule . The use of Constantinople to refer to the city during the Ottoman period ( from the mid @-@ 15th century ) is now considered politically incorrect , even if not historically inaccurate , by Turks . 
 By the 19th century , the city had acquired other names used by either foreigners or Turks . Europeans used Constantinople to refer to the whole of the city , but used the name <unk> — as the Turks also did — to describe the walled peninsula between the Golden Horn and the Sea of Marmara . Pera ( from the Greek word for " across " ) was used to describe the area between the Golden Horn and the Bosphorus , but Turks also used the name Beyoğlu ( today the official name for one of the city 's constituent districts ) . Islambol ( meaning either " City of Islam " or " Full of Islam " ) was sometimes colloquially used to refer to the city , and was even engraved on some Ottoman coins , but the belief that it was the precursor to the present name , İstanbul , is belied by the fact that the latter existed well before the former and even predates the Ottoman conquest of the city . 
 The name İstanbul ( Turkish pronunciation : [ <unk> ] , colloquially [ <unk> ] ) is commonly held to derive from the Medieval Greek phrase " εἰς τὴν <unk> " ( pronounced [ is <unk> <unk> ] ) , which means " to the city " and is how Constantinople was referred to by the local Greeks . This reflected its status as the only major city in the vicinity . The importance of Constantinople in the Ottoman world was also reflected by its Ottoman name ' Der <unk> ' meaning the ' gate to Prosperity ' in Ottoman . An alternative view is that the name evolved directly from the name Constantinople , with the first and third syllables dropped . A Turkish folk etymology traces the name to Islam bol " plenty of Islam " because the city was called Islambol ( " plenty of Islam " ) or <unk> ( " find Islam " ) as the capital of the Islamic Ottoman Empire . It is first attested shortly after the conquest , and its invention was ascribed by some contemporary writers to Sultan Mehmed II himself . Some Ottoman sources of the 17th century , such as Evliya Çelebi , describe it as the common Turkish name of the time ; between the late 17th and late 18th centuries , it was also in official use . The first use of the word " Islambol " on coinage was in 1703 ( 1115 AH ) during the reign of Sultan Ahmed III . Nevertheless , the use of the name Constantinople remained common in English into the 20th century , Istanbul became common only after Turkey adapted the Latin alphabet in 1928 and urged other countries to use the city 's Turkish name . 
 In modern Turkish , the name is written as İstanbul , with a dotted <unk> , as the Turkish alphabet distinguishes between a dotted and <unk> I. In English the stress is on the last syllable ( <unk> ) , but in Turkish it is on the second syllable ( tan ) . A person from the city is an <unk> ( plural : <unk> ) , although <unk> is used in English . 
 = = History = = 
 Neolithic artifacts , uncovered by archeologists at the beginning of the 21st century , indicate that Istanbul 's historic peninsula was settled as far back as the 7th millennium BCE . That early settlement , important in the spread of the Neolithic Revolution from the Near East to Europe , lasted for almost a millennium before being inundated by rising water levels . The first human settlement on the Asian side , the <unk> mound , is from the Copper Age period , with artifacts dating from 5500 to 3500 BCE , On the European side , near the point of the peninsula ( Sarayburnu ) , there was a Thracian settlement during the early 1st millennium BCE . Modern authors have linked it to the Thracian toponym <unk> , mentioned by Pliny the Elder as an earlier name for the site of Byzantium . 
 The history of the city proper begins around 660 BCE , when Greek settlers from Megara established Byzantium on the European side of the Bosphorus . The settlers built an acropolis adjacent to the Golden Horn on the site of the early Thracian settlements , fueling the nascent city 's economy . The city experienced a brief period of Persian rule at the turn of the 5th century BCE , but the Greeks recaptured it during the Greco @-@ Persian Wars . Byzantium then continued as part of the Athenian League and its successor , the Second Athenian Empire , before gaining independence in 355 BCE . Long allied with the Romans , Byzantium officially became a part of the Roman Empire in 73 CE . Byzantium 's decision to side with the Roman usurper Pescennius Niger against Emperor Septimius Severus cost it dearly ; by the time it surrendered at the end of 195 CE , two years of siege had left the city devastated . Five years later , Severus began to rebuild Byzantium , and the city regained — and , by some accounts , surpassed — its previous prosperity .
