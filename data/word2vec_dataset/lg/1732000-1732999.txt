 On 24 March 1998 , the Radio Authority advertised for the first ( and at the time , the only one planned ) national ensemble to be broadcast on DAB . The three national commercial services on FM and mediumwave had to be included as part of the ensemble , Classic FM , talkSPORT and Virgin Radio . The licence was awarded to the sole applicant , GWR Group and NTL Broadcast to form Digital One . The original licence application included the following stations : 
 After the closure of PrimeTime Radio in 2006 , the original licence was amended to allow the launch of a new classic and contemporary jazz service , <unk> which was launched on 25 December 2006 , before the 31 December 2006 deadline set in the licence amendment . 
 In April 2009 , Global Radio , which had acquired GCap Media - part owner of Digital One , sold its 63 % stake in the ensemble to Arqiva , making them the sole owner and operator of the ensemble . 
 On 26 July 2013 , Digital One extended its broadcasts to Northern Ireland . Previously , only one VHF Band III frequency was allocated to Northern Ireland which was allocated to the local commercial ensemble . Block 11D became available in 2013 after digital television switchover in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland .

 The Radio Authority ( and subsequently Ofcom ) continue to award regional ensemble licences to a number of radio groups with advertising of the licences starting from 1998 , and licence awards being awarded from 10 May 1999 , with the Birmingham ensemble being the first local licence being issued to CE Digital . The Birmingham ensemble licence award was followed by awards for licences in Manchester , Greater London , Glasgow and South Yorkshire , with more licences being awarded afterwards . 
 In October 2006 , Ofcom announced a timetable of locations which would get its own DAB ensemble , where a local ensemble does not currently offer coverage . Three blocks will be made available in VHF Band III . In May 2007 , Ofcom replaced the York and Scarborough proposed licence area for a licence which covers the whole of North Yorkshire , and the Guildford plus Reigate and Crawley licences were merged to cover Surrey . 
 Areas covered are as follows : 
 As part of the Digital Economy Act 2010 which gained Royal Assent and became law on 8 April . 2010 , some DAB ensembles will be reorganised and merged . As a result , local ensembles waited for both the act to commence on 12 June 2010 and a report on the planning of DAB coverage and frequencies across the UK , with the final publication made to Government on 1 May 2012 before going ahead with announcements on the launch of additional local ensembles .

 The first regional licence to cover a greater area of land compared to a local ensemble was awarded on 6 October 2000 to Switch Digital for Central Scotland Other areas which were awarded and classed as regional licences include : 
 In March 2009 , Ofcom made a recommendation to the Government in their Radio in Digital Britain report that the regional ensembles should expand into a nationwide regionalised service to fill the gap made by the <unk> Group pulling out of the second national ensemble . Ofcom cited that the regions for the second national ensemble would be : 
 The East Midlands , East Anglia , mid and southern Lincolnshire ; 
 London , Southern England , the South East and the South Midlands ; 
 Northern Ireland ; 
 North East England and Cumbria ; 
 North West England ; 
 Scotland ; 
 The West Midlands ; 
 Wales ; 
 The West and South West of England ; 
 Yorkshire , the North Midlands and North Lincolnshire . 
 On 25 September 2012 , it was announced that the MXR <unk> will close between July and September 2013 after the shareholders Global Radio & Arqiva decided not to renew the licences . Digital Radio UK stated that the released frequencies of the closed regional multiplexes would be reused for local DAB coverage roll @-@ out .

 Ofcom announced in 2005 that they would be advertising for the second national digital ensemble . As a result , GCap threatened to take Ofcom to court after being told by the Radio Authority that there would not be another national ensemble . The court action was dropped after Ofcom assured GCap that none of the stations on the second ensemble would compete with existing stations on the Digital One ensemble . 
 On 1 December 2006 , Ofcom advertised a licence for a second national digital ensemble to launch new digital radio and multimedia services on frequency block 11A ( 216 @.@ 928 MHz ) . Applications needed to be submitted to Ofcom by 28 March 2007 . 
 On 29 March 2007 , Ofcom announced that it had received two applications for the second national digital ensemble , from the 4 Digital Group and National Grid Wireless . The radio channels which made up both applications are as follows : 
 On 6 July 2007 Ofcom awarded the licence for the second national ensemble to the 4 Digital Group , who were required to launch its services one year after its licence award . However , on 10 October 2008 the 4 Digital Group pulled its plans for digital radio , including the launch of the second multiplex . Ofcom held talks with the other remaining shareholders of the 4 Digital Group to see if they were willing to continue with the launch . In March 2009 , Ofcom recommended to the Government that the second national ensemble should be regionalised , formed by the existing regional ensembles .

 On 1 July 2014 , Ofcom re @-@ advertised the second national ensemble licence on frequency 11A for interested parties to submit applications by 31 October 2014 . The deadline was extended to 15 : 00 on 29 January 2015 . 
 On 29 January 2015 , it was announced that two bidders had applied for the licence to run the second national ensemble . <unk> , run primarily by Orion Media and Babcock International Group amongst others and Sound Digital , run by Arqiva , Bauer and UTV amongst others . On 27 March , Sound Digital was announced as the winning bidder .

 After experimentation on the Brighton experimental ensemble , Ofcom advertised for small scale DAB multiplexes to broadcast across the United Kingdom on ten localised multiplexes for a nine @-@ month trial period . The trials will test the viability of using free and open source software with low cost equipment to broadcast from a single transmitter , a single frequency network or channel repeaters to allow smaller radio stations to broadcast more cost effectively than is currently possible on local multiplexes .

 Digital Radio UK is an organisation which represents the interests of the digital radio industry including the BBC , commercial radio companies and transmission network operator , Arqiva . The organisation also promotes the use and take up of DAB in the United Kingdom and ensure that the deadline for digital migration in 2015 is met . Digital Radio UK is formed from the Digital Radio Delivery Group which also absorbed the Digital Radio Development Bureau ( DRDB ) . Part of DRDB 's plans , and under Digital Radio UK still is , will be to promote DAB uptake through a website for consumers as well as print and radio advertising .

 Marina <unk> Diamandis ( Greek : <unk> @-@ <unk> <unk> ; born 10 October 1985 ) , known professionally as Marina and the Diamonds , is a Welsh singer @-@ songwriter . 
 Born in Brynmawr and raised in nearby Pandy , she moved to London as a teenager to become a professional singer , despite having little formal musical experience . In 2009 , Diamandis came to prominence upon placing second in the BBC 's Sound of 2010 . Her debut studio album , The Family Jewels ( 2010 ) , incorporates indie pop and new wave musical styles . It entered the UK Albums Chart at number five and was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry . The album 's second song , " Hollywood " , peaked at number 12 on the UK Singles Chart . 
 Her follow @-@ up record Electra Heart ( 2012 ) , is a concept album about a character of the same name . It integrates prominent elements of electropop , and its producers include StarGate , Dr. Luke and Diplo . It became her first number @-@ one project in the United Kingdom , where it was also certified gold , and its lead single " Primadonna " is her highest @-@ charting track in the UK Singles Chart , reaching number 11 . Diamandis describes Electra Heart as " tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek " and considers it to have been better received in the United States , while some British fans disliked the change in musical direction . The song " Electra Heart " portrays the death of the character . Diamandis 's synthpop @-@ inspired third studio album Froot ( 2015 ) became her third top @-@ ten album in the United Kingdom , and her first top @-@ ten entry on the US Billboard 200 where it charted at number 8 . Produced entirely by Diamandis and David <unk> , it was praised for its cohesive sound and introspective lyrical content . 
 Diamandis has described herself as an " indie artist with pop goals " and often analyses components of human behaviour in her music . She is additionally recognised for her retro , surreal and cartoonish fashion styles , and has been described as an artist with a cult following , and a gay icon . 
 = = Early life and career beginnings = = 
 Diamandis was born in Brynmawr in Wales , and grew up in the nearby village of Pandy . She has one older sister , <unk> Diamandis . Their Welsh mother and Greek father met at university in Newcastle @-@ upon @-@ Tyne , and divorced when Marina was four . Following the divorce , her father returned to Greece but would visit on occasion , while Marina lived in a bungalow with her mother , sharing a bedroom with her sister ; she described her childhood as " simple and idyllic , " as well as " peaceful , very normal , poor . " 
 In her childhood , she attended Haberdashers ' Monmouth School for Girls , reflecting that " I sort of found my talent there … I was the one who always <unk> off choir , but I had an incredible music teacher who managed to convince me I could do anything . " However , she felt that she " stuck out " by being from a lower @-@ income family than the other girls at the school . At the age of 16 , she moved to Greece with her father " to connect with my heritage and learn to speak the language " and sang Greek folk songs with her grandmother . Having earned an International Baccalaureate at St. Catherine 's British Embassy School in Athens , she returned to Wales two years later . She and her mother then moved to Ross @-@ on @-@ Wye , Herefordshire . " Obsessed with becoming a singer , almost as if it was a disease , " she worked for two months at a petrol station in order to earn money to move to London . 
 Despite not having a musical background , Diamandis was able to create lyrics due to her childhood love of writing . She first began writing music when she was 18 years old ; she moved to London to attend dance school , but quit two months later . She studied music at the University of East London and transferred to a classic composition course in Middlesex University the following year , but after two months she dropped out . 
 Knowing that the Spice Girls were formed by an advertisement in The Stage , Diamandis applied for auditions listed in that newspaper . She travelled for several unsuccessful auditions , including opportunities with the musical for The Lion King and a boy band organised by Virgin Records , during which she managed to leave her CV to an A & R Representative , but was unable to audition at the time of the appointment as she felt sick . In 2005 , she created the stage name " Marina and the Diamonds " ; after coming to prominence , " the Diamonds " was established as a reference to her fans , instead of her backing band . 
 Inspired by the example of Daniel Johnston , Diamandis decided to compose her own music and stop going to auditions ; she taught herself how to play the piano and recorded music on a keyboard . She self @-@ composed and produced her earlier demos with GarageBand , and independently released her debut extended play Mermaid vs. Sailor through Myspace in 2007 . She held discussions with fourteen music labels , rejecting all but one as she believed it was the only one which would not dictate her image . She came to the attention of Neon Gold Records ' Derek Davies in 2008 , which managed her for six months , and was hired as the supporting act for Australian recording artist Gotye . In October , Diamandis finalised a recording contract with 679 Recordings ( eventually renamed 679 Artists ) , a subdivision of Warner Music Group .

 = = = 2009 – 10 : The Family Jewels = = = 
 Diamandis 's debut single " Obsessions " was released on 14 February 2009 through Neon Gold Records , while her first extended play The Crown Jewels EP followed on 1 June . That summer , she performed at BBC Radio 1 's Big Weekend , the Glastonbury Festival , and the Reading and Leeds Festivals . She also performed at iTunes Live , releasing a second EP in July 2009 of performances from that festival . 
 In December 2009 , Diamandis was ranked in second place on the Sound of 2010 poll organised by BBC , behind singer @-@ songwriter Ellie Goulding ; she was one of three nominees for the Critics ' Choice Award at the 2010 BRIT Awards , which also went to Goulding . " Mowgli 's Road " was released on 13 November 2009 , with Diamandis describing it as " uncommercial " , but it received attention after its video was shared by bloggers including Perez Hilton and Kanye West . It was followed by " Hollywood " on 1 February , which reached number 12 on the UK Singles Chart . 
 Diamandis 's debut studio album The Family Jewels was released on 15 February 2010 ; it debuted at number five on the UK Albums Chart with first @-@ week sales of 27 @,@ 618 copies , and was eventually certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry . Atlantic Records signed Diamandis to Chop Shop Records in the United States in March 2010 . Through the label , she released her third extended play The American Jewels EP on 23 March , and later released The Family Jewels in the United States on 25 May . The latter project debuted at number 138 on the US Billboard 200 with first @-@ week sales of 24 @,@ 000 copies . On Billboard 's Top Heatseekers and Top Rock Albums charts , it peaked at numbers 2 and 49 respectively . 
 " I Am Not a Robot " was serviced as the third single from The Family Jewels on 26 April , and peaked at number 26 on the UK Singles Chart . " Oh No ! " followed as the fourth single from the record in July , and reached number 38 in the United Kingdom . The fifth and final single " Shampain " peaked at number 141 on the UK Singles Chart , consequently underperforming by comparison with its preceding singles . To further promote The Family Jewels , Diamandis embarked on The Family Jewels Tour , which visited Europe , North America and Australia throughout 2010 and 2011 . In January 2011 , in an Australian radio interview , she expressed disappointment at her career , particularly in her failure to attract an American audience . She put this down to inaction by her label and American listeners ' contemporary taste for " pumping beats " by artists such as Lady Gaga . 
 = = = 2011 – 13 : Electra Heart = = = 
 In summer 2011 , Diamandis and Swedish recording artist Robyn performed as the opening acts for American recording artist Katy Perry 's California Dreams Tour . On 30 September , Diamandis released the track " Radioactive " through the iTunes Store ; it peaked at number 25 on the UK Singles Chart . Her second studio album was preceded by its lead single " Primadonna " in April 2012 ; the song is notable for being Diamandis 's highest @-@ charting track on the UK Singles Chart , where it reached number 11 . It is certified silver by the BPI and platinum by the respective authorities in Australia , Denmark and New Zealand . 
 The final product Electra Heart is a concept album lyrically united by the ideas of " female identity " and " a recent breakup . " Diamandis created the titular character " Electra Heart " as a protagonist for the project ; she portrays the personas " Teen Idle , " " Primadonna , " " Homewrecker , " and " Housewife , " which represent several female archetypes of stereotypical American culture . The project was released on 27 April 2012 , and debuted at number one on the UK Albums Chart with first @-@ week sales of 21 @,@ 358 copies . It became Diamandis 's first chart @-@ topping album in the United Kingdom , although at the time it was additionally distinguished as the lowest @-@ selling number @-@ one record of the 21st century in the country . The album was certified gold by the British Phonographic Industry for exceeding shipments of 100 @,@ 000 units , and gold by the Irish Recorded Music Association for surpassing 7 @,@ 500 sales . 
 " Power & Control " was released as the second single from Electra Heart on 20 July , although it peaked at number 193 on the UK Singles Chart . Later that month , it was announced that " How to Be a Heartbreaker " would be released as the second single in the United States and the third single in the United Kingdom . Diamandis commented that she had written the track while Electra Heart was being pressed in the United Kingdom , and consequently missed the cut @-@ off for initial inclusion on the record ; however , it was featured in the revised track listing for the American version . It peaked at number 88 in the latter country . Throughout 2012 , Diamandis travelled for The Lonely Hearts Club Tour , her second headlining concert tour , and Mylo Xyloto Tour headlined by Coldplay , for which she served as an opening act . On 8 August 2013 , Diamandis released a music video for the previously unreleased title track " Electra Heart " ; it depicted the death of the character , and symbolically ended the promotional campaign for Electra Heart . 
 = = = 2014 – 16 : Froot = = = 
 After spending one month in New York City , Diamandis announced in February 2013 that she had begun writing material for an upcoming third studio album . The single " Froot " was released on 10 October , her 29th birthday , and announced as the title track . 
 The album was announced to be released on 3 April 2015 with a new track from the album being announced each month . However , due to an Internet leak , the release was brought forward . Entirely produced by Diamandis and David <unk> , the album was praised for its cohesive sound . Froot debuted at number 8 on the Billboard 200 chart , and is currently her highest charting album in the United States . It also peaked at 10 , 6 and 4 in the UK , Canada and Ireland respectively . 
 In early 2015 , it was announced that Diamandis would perform at Lollapalooza Brazil , Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival and the Boston Calling Music Festival in March , April and May 2015 respectively . From October 2015 to the following October she embarked on the Neon Nature Tour across Europe and the Americas ; each performance was split into three acts , one for each of her albums , with most songs coming from Froot . Her 4 November performance at the House of Blues in Boston was broadcast live by Yahoo . During a question @-@ and @-@ answer video , Diamandis said that subsequent tours would be different , as her usual tours had been " a hard lifestyle . " In April 2016 , she said she would take a break from music after her tour . She returned to performing two months later , clarifying that she would rather work on a consistent basis than a cycle of touring and resting . 
 = = Artistry = = 
 = = = Musical style and influences = = = 
 As a child , Diamandis took inspiration from the differing musical tastes of her parents – Dolly Parton , Enya and George Michael from her mother , and Haris <unk> from her father – while also admiring pop acts of the era including the Spice Girls , Britney Spears and S Club 7 . Diamandis has revealed that " Madonna was the reason I wanted to be a pop star from the age of 15 , " however she also stated that she did not listen to music " properly " until the age of 19 , when she took influence from acts including PJ Harvey , Fiona Apple and The Distillers . She began smoking two years later in an attempt to sound like The Distillers ' frontwoman Brody Dalle , " but it never worked , and now I 'm just stuck with a bad habit . " She has cited Dalle and Spears as her musical influences , and has expressed a particular interest in Daniel Johnston and the lo @-@ fi production he uses . She has jokingly stated that " I probably have a bit of a different sound because I don 't really know what I 'm doing ! , " referencing her lack of formal musical training . Diamandis has synesthesia , and as a result associates particular colours with musical notes and days of the week . 
 A self @-@ described " DIY musician " and " indie artist with pop goals , " Diamandis considers her music to be " alternate pop " . Lester wrote in 2008 that Diamandis 's musical direction was " hard to fathom " , given the frequency with which she alternated " simple keyboards @-@ based ballads " and " quirky new wave @-@ inflected numbers . " Whereas The Family Jewels incorporated prominent elements of new wave music , Electra Heart was heavily inspired by electropop musical styles . Diamandis opined that the United States was more welcoming of said musical transition than the United Kingdom , and suggested that the American audience embraced the humour behind the latter " tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek record " . Froot is a pop record , with elements of europop and pop rock . 
 At the start of her career , Diamandis was compared to other British female singer @-@ songwriters , with Paul Lester from The Guardian writing that she had a " zeitgeist @-@ y female essence " , although she took exception at such comparisons and said that all she shared with Kate Nash was " a vagina and a keyboard . " During the Electra Heart era , she called comparisons to Lady Gaga , Katy Perry and Lana Del Rey " really annoying " , preferring to be classed as herself . Her vocals have been compared to those of Karen O , Regina Spektor , Kate Bush , and Florence Welch , with an androgynous timbre akin to those of Annie Lennox and Heather Small . When reviewing The Family Jewels , Joe Copplestone from PopMatters noted that Diamandis 's vocal delivery occasionally overpowers the " inventive " melodies showcased in her songs . 
 Diamandis 's lyrical content typically analyses components of human behaviour ; she has noted that she would have become a psychologist had she been unsuccessful in the music industry . The song " Savages " , from Froot , reflects on humanity 's proneness to violent acts . She is a feminist and wrote her song " Sex Yeah " as a " feminist statement . " Rory Cashin of Slate lauded Diamandis 's lyrics as " esoteric , " likening her to an " emotionally intelligent outsider who knew how to perfectly articulate those weird thoughts and reactions we all have but would never admit to . " Laurence Day of The Line of Best Fit considered Froot to be " an anthology of astute nihilistic , existentialist discussions " . 
 = = = Public image = = = 
 Diamandis has identified Sophia Loren , Leigh <unk> , Shirley Manson and Gwen Stefani as her fashion icons , and Asli <unk> and Mary Benson as among her favourite designers . As part of Selfridges ' " Sound of Music " , Diamandis and Paloma Faith designed their own window display for the London Oxford Street branch in May 2010 , and additionally appeared as a " live mannequins " for the display . In November , Diamandis was featured on the website for the British edition of Vogue , where she contributed to the " Today I 'm Wearing " column that month . In February 2011 , she became a brand ambassador for Max Factor , who called her " colourful personality " a perfect fit for the brand . In 2013 , she launched a fashion brand named 11 Diamonds and designed a line of T @-@ shirts for it , but has had little involvement with it since . 
 According to Emily Jupp of The Independent , despite various changes in musical direction , an " unconventional fashion sense " has been a constant in Diamandis 's career . In the video to " How to be a Heartbreaker , " she " subverts the norm " by wearing more clothes than male models in the background ; she reflected that " I don ’ t think it suits me to wear very little clothing , it just wouldn ’ t feel right . I ’ d rather people listen to what I have to say instead of staring at my bum . " In 2011 , when promoting The Family Jewels , Diamandis described her fashion styles as " vintage , cheerleader , and cartoon . " Four years later , she described her costumes then as " very badly put together vintage , kind of glittery ensemble " , and her outfits for Froot as a " mix of ' 70s with digital <unk> ... something surreal and ' 70s . " 
 She has been described as a " pop enigma " , an artist who " never felt like she belonged to the masses " and one with a cult following . She has criticised the Brit Awards for ostensibly being too corporate focussed , and has called for a new ceremony ideologically between the Brits and the " left @-@ field " Mercury Prize . Diamandis used to meet fans after each performance , but ended this practice for safety reasons during the Neon Nature Tour , instead having ten pairs of fans chosen to meet her before the show . 
 Diamandis estimates that gay people comprise 60 % of her concert audience ; she attributes her status as a gay icon to her campness and sense of humour , in addition to lyrics on being a societal outsider . In 2012 , she won the Best Music Award at gay magazine Attitude 's award show . She headlined an NYC Pride event in June 2016 in the aftermath of the Pulse nightclub shooting , wearing a rainbow @-@ striped cape . Diamandis plays down her popularity in the gay community in order to avoid sounding like a " cliché pop star " and hopes for a time when acceptance will mean that people do not label themselves by their sexuality . 
 She has been physically compared to her friend and label mate Charli XCX . In March 2016 , the two feuded over Charli XCX 's photoshoot which Diamandis considered to be derivative of her own image on Froot .

 = Belgium in World War II = 
 Despite being neutral at the start of World War II , Belgium and its colonial possessions found themselves at war after the country was invaded by German forces on 10 May 1940 . After 18 days of fighting in which Belgian forces were pushed back into a small pocket in the north @-@ east of the country , the Belgian military surrendered to the Germans , beginning an occupation that would endure until 1944 . The surrender of 28 May was ordered by King Leopold III without the consultation of his government and sparked a political crisis after the war . Despite the capitulation , many Belgians managed to escape to the United Kingdom where they formed a government and army @-@ in @-@ exile on the Allied side . 
 The Belgian Congo remained loyal to the Belgian government in London and contributed significant material and human resources to the Allied cause . Many Belgians were involved in both armed and passive resistance to German forces , although some chose to collaborate with the German forces . Support from right @-@ wing political factions and sections of the Belgian population allowed the German army to recruit two divisions of the Waffen @-@ SS from Belgium and also facilitated the Nazi persecution of Belgian Jews in which nearly 25 @,@ 000 were killed . 
 Most of the country was liberated by the Allies between September and October 1944 , though areas to the far east of the country remained occupied until early 1945 . In total , approximately 88 @,@ 000 Belgians died during the conflict , a figure representing 1 @.@ 05 percent of the country 's pre @-@ war population , and around 8 percent of the country 's GDP was destroyed . 
 = = Background = = 
 During the 1930s , Belgium was still recovering from the destruction of World War I. Economically , Belgium was experiencing high unemployment in the aftermath of the Great Depression of 1929 , and by 1932 unemployment stood at 23 @.@ 5 percent though under the " New Deal @-@ style " Plan de Man this had been reduced to around 15 percent by 1937 . 
 The 1930s also saw the growth of several authoritarian and fascist political parties in both Wallonia and Flanders . In the 1936 elections , one of these , the French @-@ speaking Rexist party , gained 11 @.@ 6 percent of the national vote . By 1939 however , extremist parties lost many of the seats that they had previously gained in new elections and political stability seemed to be returning . 
 = = = Neutrality = = = 
 As Belgium had suffered so much damage in World War I , there was little appetite within the country to involve itself in any potential European conflict . In October 1936 , King Leopold III announced that Belgium would remain neutral in the event of another war in Europe as part of what he termed an Independent Policy ( Politique d 'Indépendance ) . To this end , the Belgian government tried to steer a path away from alliances : leaving the Locarno Treaty , repudiating a defence pact with France signed in 1920 and receiving a guarantee of neutrality from Nazi Germany in 1937 . 
 The German Government considers that the inviolability and integrity of Belgium are common interests of the Western Powers . It confirms its determination that in no circumstances will it impair this inviolability and integrity and that it will at all times respect Belgian territory ... 
 During this period , the Belgian military was reorganized as an exclusively defensive force and began construction and modernization of fortifications around the country , particularly around Liège near the German border . 
 On the declaration of war between the United Kingdom , France , and Germany in September 1939 , the Belgian government launched a crash re @-@ armament program , augmenting the national defenses by creating the K @-@ W Line linking the National Redoubt at Antwerp with the south along the River <unk> , just behind the main Fortified Position of Liège . 
 = = 18 Days ' Campaign = = 
 With the German invasion of Poland in September 1939 , although still following a policy of neutrality , the Belgian government began general mobilization . By 1940 , the army numbered between 600 @,@ 000 and 650 @,@ 000 men ( nearly 20 percent of the male population of Belgium ) making it approximately four times larger than the British Expeditionary Force and twice as large as the Dutch army at the time . 
 The invasion of Belgium by Nazi Germany started on 10 May 1940 under the codename Fall Gelb ( " Case Yellow " ) as part of the wider invasion of France , the Netherlands and Luxembourg . The Belgian Albert Canal fortifications , some of the most modern defensive networks in Europe , proved almost useless . At Eben @-@ Emael , the fort held by 1 @,@ 200 Belgians was taken when the Germans deployed 500 glider @-@ borne Fallschirmjäger against them , opening the border for Blitzkrieg @-@ style warfare . Almost all of the air force 's modern Hurricane fighters were also destroyed by the Luftwaffe on the ground at Schaffen airfield on May 10 . 
 The German breakthrough at Sedan , which had been thought impassable , meant that defenders of the K @-@ W Line risked being outflanked , and had to withdraw on 16 May . The German invasion triggered a panic amongst Belgian civilians in the path of the advancing German army . By 11 May , the roads leading westwards , away from the fighting , were blocked by refugees , hampering the eastward advance of French and British forces . It is estimated that around two million civilians fled their homes during the campaign . 
 The government 's policy of neutrality had left Belgium with an outdated and ill @-@ equipped army and air force . Above all , the army possessed only 16 battle tanks between its two cavalry divisions for political reasons as they had been considered too " aggressive " for the army of a neutral power . The air force , hurriedly reorganised in May 1940 , was taken by surprise and could only field 180 serviceable aircraft out of its total of 234 . 
 The military held out against German forces for 18 days , against overwhelming odds . On 28 May , forced into a small pocket along the Leie river and after failed attempts to broker a ceasefire on the 27th , the Belgian king and military surrendered unconditionally . Belgian casualties during the campaign numbered some 6 @,@ 000 killed and 15 @,@ 850 wounded . Some 112 @,@ 500 French and Belgian troops escaped to the UK via Dunkirk but the majority of the Belgian survivors were made prisoners of war and many were not released until the end of the war . 
 With the surrender of the Belgian army , the government , led by Hubert Pierlot , fled first to Paris and formed a government in exile in Bordeaux . After the Fall of France , the government transferred to Eaton Square , London .

 Leopold III , King and commander in chief of the Belgian army , surrendered personally to German forces on 28 May , contrary to the advice of Pierlot 's government , having personally decided that the Allied cause was lost . His decision was fiercely criticized by the French Prime Minister , Paul Reynaud and by Pierlot in a radio broadcast on 28 June 1940 , where he declared Leopold 's decision to be " an event without precedent in history " . 
 The King remained in Belgium during the war as a German prisoner while the government went into exile and continued military action in the Allied cause . Unlike the Netherlands and Luxembourg where the monarchy was repressed or had joined the government in exile , Leopold III remained prominent in the occupied territory , and coins and stamps produced during the occupation continued to carry his face or monogram . Nevertheless , Leopold remained a focus for resistance , his position explained by the slogan " Belgium is captive ! Long live Belgium ! The King is captive ! Long live the King ! " While imprisoned , he sent a letter to Adolf Hitler in 1942 which has been credited with saving an estimated 500 @,@ 000 Belgian women and children from forced deportation to munitions factories in Germany . In November 1940 , Leopold visited Hitler in Berchtesgaden where he asked for Belgian prisoners of war to be freed . 
 After the war , allegations that Leopold 's surrender had been an act of collaboration provoked a political crisis , known as the Royal Question , about whether he could return to the throne , which ultimately ended with his abdication .

 = = = Life in occupied Belgium = = = 
 Belgium was run by a German military government under General Alexander von Falkenhausen and Eggert Reeder until July 1944 , and then by Reichskommissar Josef Grohé until liberation . The German government levied the costs of the military occupation on the Belgians through taxes , while also demanding " external occupation costs " ( or " Anti @-@ Bolshevik charge " ) to support operations elsewhere . In total , Belgium was forced to pay nearly two @-@ thirds of its national income for these charges , a figure equaling 5 @.@ 7 billion Reichsmarks . 
 As in all occupied countries in Europe , food , fuel and clothing were strictly rationed by the German authorities . Even with the stringent rationing , the food and materials which civilians should officially have been entitled to were not always available . A significant black market also existed in the country , supplying food illegally at very high prices to those that could afford it . Information and the press were strictly controlled by the German government and news was greatly restricted . Nevertheless , the sales of collaborationist newspapers like Le Soir and the newspapers of pro @-@ collaborationist political parties like Le Pays Réel remained high . A large number of underground newspapers were also published and distributed – the underground paper La Libre Belgique achieved a circulation of 30 @,@ 000 . 
 Occupied Belgium was also targeted by the Allied bombers from both the British RAF and American USAAF . The policy led to high civilian casualties as bombs missed their intended targets and fell on civilian areas . In a raid on the <unk> Motor Works in the Belgian town of <unk> ( near Antwerp ) in April 1943 , just two bombs dropped by the B @-@ 17s of the U.S. 8th Air Force fell on the intended target . The remaining 24 tons of bombs fell on civilian areas of the town , killing 936 and injuring 1 @,@ 600 more in just eight minutes . The Allied policy was condemned by many leading figures within Belgium , including Cardinal van Roey . 
 Around 375 @,@ 000 Belgians also served in labour programs within Germany during the war , working in manual jobs in industry or agriculture for the German war effort . Though nearly 180 @,@ 000 Belgians signed up before conscription began in 1941 , most were conscripted after that date and worked as forced labour against their will . 
 200 @,@ 000 Belgian military prisoners of war , who had been captured in 1940 , were also transported to Germany . Most were used as forced labour and paid only a nominal sum . About 80 @,@ 000 ( mainly Flemish ) prisoners were returned to Belgium between late 1940 and 1941 , but many remained in captivity until the end of the war . They were often kept in very poor conditions and around 2 @,@ 000 died . 
 = = = Collaboration = = = 
 During the period of Nazi occupation , some Belgians collaborated with their occupiers . There were pro @-@ Nazi political organizations in both Flemish and Walloon communities before and during the war . The most significant were DeVlag , Verdinaso and Vlaams Nationaal Verbond ( VNV ) in Flanders as well as the catholic Rex movement in Wallonia . Each of these movements had subtly different ideologies , their own paramilitary forces and printed their own newspapers . These organisations were also instrumental in encouraging Belgians to enlist into the German Army . Unlike the German @-@ style National Socialist agenda of DeVlag , VNV appealed directly to a Flemish separatist agenda , though this message was never the main source of their popularity . Infighting between the groups , particularly VNV and DeVlag , was considerable . 
 On the whole , the Belgian administrative system was very pliant and became an instrument of collaboration . In a 2007 report by a Belgian research institute , <unk> , a panel of historians concluded that Belgium had offered " maximum administrative collaboration " with the German occupation forces . The same report also commented on the apparently higher levels of collaboration in Flanders as part of an attempted integration into a " German @-@ Flemish New Order " . The towns of Brussels and Liège , the report added , " remained [ generally ] patriotic @-@ Belgian and decisively hostile to Germany " . The report also found that many Belgian authorities had been compliant , even active , in the deportation of Jews . 
 Two separate units of the Waffen @-@ SS , the Flemish Legion and the Walloon Legion , were recruited from Belgium during the occupation . Léon Degrelle , founder of the Rexist Party , served as commander of the Walloon Legion , which fought against the Soviet Union in Eastern Europe . A total of 15 @,@ 000 Belgians in the " divisions " ( neither ever greater than brigade strength ) fought on the Eastern Front where the Walloon Legion was nearly annihilated in the Korsun – Cherkassy Pocket in 1944 . 
 After the war , a total of 400 @,@ 000 Belgians were investigated for collaboration . Of these , around 56 @,@ 000 were prosecuted . The majority received prison sentences although several hundred were executed . 
 = = = Resistance = = = 
 Resistance to German occupation came from all levels and regions of Belgium and quarters of the political spectrum , but was highly fragmented and localised . The government in exile dealt only with sympathetic resistance groups , like the Armée Secrète , however even these umbrella organisations had many different agendas or political ideologies . Some groups were very left @-@ wing , like the Communist Partisans <unk> , but there were also right @-@ wing resistance movements , like the monarchist Mouvement National Royaliste and the fascist Légion Belge , created by members of the pre @-@ war Légion Nationale movement . There were also other groups like Groupe G which had no obvious political affiliation . 
 Resistance to the occupiers chiefly came in the form of helping Allied airmen escape , and numerous lines were set up to organise this effort ; for instance the Comet line which evacuated an estimated 700 Allied servicemen to Gibraltar . The Comet Line had a series of safe houses throughout Belgium . Allied airmen were given civilian clothes and were frequently moved from house to house , staying with Belgian families who supported the resistance . The resistance would aid the airmen by giving them false papers and guiding them to either neutral or Allied occupied territory . 
 As elsewhere , sabotage was employed against enemy military and economic assets , with railway lines and bridges being common targets . The activities of Groupe G , a small student resistance cell based in Brussels , alone are estimated to have cost the Nazis 10 million man @-@ hours of labour to repair damages done . Direct attacks on German troops and military installations were rarer , yet one estimate puts the number of German soldiers killed by the Belgian resistance in 1941 as higher than in all of France . 
 The resistance were instrumental in saving Jews and Roma from deportation to death camps , for instance the attack on the " Twentieth convoy " to Auschwitz . Many Belgians also hid Jews and political dissidents during the occupation , with one estimate putting the number at some 20 @,@ 000 people hidden during the war . There was also significant low @-@ level resistance , for instance in June 1941 , the City Council of Brussels refused to distribute Stars of David badges . Certain high profile members of the Belgian establishment , including Queen Elizabeth and Cardinal van Roey , Archbishop of Malines , spoke out against the German treatment of Jews . So far , 1 @,@ 612 Belgians have been awarded the distinction of " Righteous Among the Nations " by the State of Israel for risking their lives to save Jews from persecution during the occupation . 
 Nevertheless , Belgian civilians were often subject to retaliation by paramilitaries and German forces for resistance activity . In August 1944 , 20 civilians were killed by Rexist paramilitaries in a reprisal for a single attack on a Rexist politician in the Courcelles Massacre . 
 = = = The Holocaust = = = 
 In mid @-@ 1940 , nearly 56 @,@ 000 Jews were living in Belgium out of a population of roughly 8 million . Many had fled to Belgium to escape recent persecution in Germany and elsewhere , meaning that only a minority were Belgian citizens . Most of the Jewish population was focused in communities in the towns of Brussels and Antwerp . 
 Anti @-@ Jewish legislation ( along the lines of the German Nuremberg Laws or French laws on the status of Jews ) was enacted in October 1940 , a few months after the German occupation . Several pogroms took place in 1941 , notably in Antwerp , and economic assets belonging to Jews were seized . In May 1942 , wearing of the yellow Star @-@ of @-@ David badge became compulsory for Jews in Belgium . 
 From June 1942 , as part of the " Final Solution " , Jews living in Belgium were ordered to report to the Mechelen transit camp . Those who did not do so voluntarily were rounded up by the police . Between August 1942 and July 1944 , a total of twenty @-@ six railway convoys deported 25 @,@ 000 Jews and 350 Roma from Belgium to eastern Europe . Most were sent to the Auschwitz death camp , although others went to camps at Bergen @-@ Belsen and <unk> . 
 Of the 25 @,@ 000 deported , over 24 @,@ 000 were killed . Fewer than 1 @,@ 000 were still alive by the time Allied forces liberated the camps . 
 The former Belgian army fort at Breendonk , near Mechelen , was requisitioned by the Nazis and used for detainment and interrogation of Jews , political prisoners and captured members of the resistance . Of the 3 @,@ 500 people incarcerated in Breendonk between 1940 and 1944 , 1 @,@ 733 died . Around 300 people were killed in the camp itself , with at least 98 of them dying from deprivation or torture . 
 = = Belgian government and army in exile = = 
 After the defeat in 1940 , significant numbers of Belgian soldiers and civilians escaped to Britain who , along with Belgian pre @-@ war émigrés in Britain and Canada , formed the Belgian forces in exile . The Belgian government , including ministers from Catholic , Socialist and Liberal parties under Hubert Pierlot , evacuated to London alongside other governments from occupied countries ( including the Netherlands and Luxembourg ) where it remained until the liberation of Belgium in 1944 . 
 The government in exile claimed the authority to speak for the whole of Belgium , leading the Minister of Foreign Affairs , Paul @-@ Henri Spaak , to comment that " all that remains of legal and free Belgium , all that is entitled to speak in her name , is in London " . A Belgian politician , Victor de <unk> , is also credited with inspiring the Allied " V for Victory " propaganda campaign in 1941 . 
 In a broadcast on French Radio , Pierlot called for the creation of an army in exile to continue the fight : 
 With the same youthful courage that responded to the government 's call , reunited with the elements of the Belgian military in France and Great Britain , a new army will be levied and organized . It will go into the line alongside those of our allies ... all the forces we have will be put at the service of the cause which has become ours ... It is important to assure immediately and in a tangible way , the solidarity which continues to unite the powers which have given us their support ... 
 By 1944 , the Free Belgian forces in the United Kingdom numbered some 4 @,@ 500 men . Belgian soldiers formed the 1st Belgian Infantry Brigade ( which also included an artillery battery of soldiers from Luxembourg ) more often known as the Brigade Piron after its commanding officer , Jean @-@ Baptiste Piron . The Brigade Piron was involved in the Normandy Invasion and the battles in France and the Netherlands until liberation . 
 Belgians also served in British special forces units during the war , forming a troop of No.10 ( Inter @-@ Allied ) Commando , which was involved in the Italian Campaign and the Landings on Walcheren . The 5th Special Air Service ( part of the élite SAS ) was made up entirely of Belgians and was the first Allied unit to enter Belgium in September 1944 . 
 400 Belgian pilots served in the Royal Air Force . Two all @-@ Belgian fighter units , Nos. 349 and 350 Squadrons , served in the European theatre . No. 350 Squadron alone claimed 51 " kills " between its formation in November 1941 and the end of the war . In total , 1 @,@ 200 Belgians served in the RAF , mainly in British or Free Dutch squadrons . 
 Two corvettes and a group of minesweepers were also operated by the Belgians during the Battle of the Atlantic . By 1943 , 350 Belgians were serving as sailors on these vessels . 
 = = Belgian Congo = = 
 Despite Belgium 's occupation , the Belgian Congo remained loyal to the government in exile and was put at the disposal of the Allies , making a significant contribution to the Allied war effort . 
 Congolese soldiers of the Force Publique were involved in fighting with Italian forces during the East African Campaign and were instrumental to forcing Italian forces out of Abyssinia , suffering 500 casualties . 13 @,@ 000 Congolese troops served under British command in Nigeria . Detachments of Congolese soldiers also served in the Middle East and Burma . In total , the Force Publique comprised approximately 40 @,@ 000 men and was racially segregated meaning that blacks could not become officers . Throughout the war , therefore , it was commanded by white officers . 
 Twice , in 1941 and 1944 , major strikes took place in towns around the country against the extra pressure put on workers by the colonial authorities . The Force Publique garrison in Luluabourg also mutinied in 1944 . These were repressed by military force , often violently . 
 The Congo was also a vitally important economic asset to the Allied powers . The Congo 's gold alone contributed some $ 28 @.@ 5 million to the Allied war effort , while its exports of rubber and uranium provided vital sources of raw materials . Most of the uranium used during the American Manhattan Project – including that used for the nuclear weapons dropped on the Japanese towns of Hiroshima and Nagasaki – was supplied by the Belgian firm Union Minière du Haut Katanga from Katanga Province in the Belgian Congo . 
 = = Liberation = = 
 Belgium was liberated late in 1944 by Allied forces , including British , Canadian , and American armies , which also included the Brigade Piron . On September 3 , 1944 the Welsh Guards liberated Brussels . Just after the liberation , the inhabitants of the <unk> district held a mock funeral for Hitler . 
 The port of Antwerp was an important strategic objective because Allied supply lines were heavily stretched and needed a deep @-@ sea port near the front lines . The British Second Army liberated Antwerp on September 6 , with help from the local resistance . Despite taking control of the city , the port was not accessible until the surrounding waters were safe for cargo ships . The Germans successfully denied access to the port until the Battle of the Scheldt completed in November . 
 Leopold III 's brother , Charles , the Count of Flanders , was appointed Regent , pending a decision about whether the King would be able to regain his former position on the throne . In February 1945 , Achille Van Acker replaced Pierlot as Prime Minister . The resistance was disarmed , and many of its members and other Belgians who had remained in the country during the occupation were mobilised into the regular Belgian army in 57 " Fusilier Battalions " . These battalions served in several battles on the western front . 100 @,@ 000 Belgians were fighting in the Allied armies by VE Day . 
 General Courtney Hodges ' U.S. First Army liberated the region south of Brussels and Maastricht in early September 1944 . While two corps of the First Army were concentrated elsewhere , VIII Corps occupied a long stretch of the front from the area south of Liège , across the Ardennes and into Luxembourg . The length of the deployment meant that the Corps ' front line was only lightly defended , leaving it vulnerable . 
 Following a few months of relative calm in Belgium , on 16 December 1944 the Germans launched the Ardennes Offensive with over a quarter of a million soldiers . Antwerp was the ultimate objective of the German offensive , but the German advance stalled before the Meuse River , at <unk> near Dinant , and was pushed back in furious fighting over a period of six weeks in bitterly cold weather by American , British and Belgian troops . Belgian towns and civilians in the Ardennes suffered during the offensive as homes were reduced to ruins , and there were instances of German troops shooting civilians . Around 90 % of the town of La Roche @-@ en @-@ Ardenne was destroyed during fighting . By 4 February 1945 , the country was reported to be free of German troops . 
 In the six months following Allied liberation , Belgian towns were widely targeted by the unpiloted German V @-@ Bombs . A total of 2 @,@ 342 of these rockets ( mostly of the more advanced V @-@ 2 type ) fell in a 10 @-@ mile radius around Antwerp alone . A post @-@ war SHAEF report estimated V @-@ Bombs had been responsible for killing 5 @,@ 000 people and injuring a further 21 @,@ 000 , mostly in the cities of Liège and Antwerp . 
 The period after liberation also saw a wave of prosecutions of those suspected of collaboration during the war . 400 @,@ 000 Belgians were investigated for collaboration of whom 56 @,@ 000 were prosecuted . Nearly 250 were executed . Léon Degrelle , despite being sentenced to death , managed to escape to Francoist Spain where he remained until his death in 1994 . 
 = = Legacy and aftermath = = 
 After the experience of World War II , Belgium abandoned its neutral stance in international politics , in favour of military , political and economic integration . In 1949 , Belgium joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and deployed troops to fight alongside other United Nations forces in the Korean War in 1950 . Belgium was also a key player in the unsuccessful negotiations about the creation of a European Defence Community ( EDC ) in the 1950s . Belgium was assigned a sector of the British zone in West Germany , around the city of Cologne , which it occupied from 1945 . Belgian soldiers remained in Germany until their final withdrawal in 2002 . 
 Economically , Belgium joined the Benelux Economic Union in 1948 and was a founding member of the European Coal and Steel Community from its creation in 1952 . From 1944 until 1960 , Belgium also experienced a period of rapid economic recovery , dubbed the " Belgian Miracle " , partially as a result of the Marshall Plan . 
 The political crisis surrounding Leopold III 's role during the occupation , and whether he could return to the throne , polarized Belgian public opinion in the years following the war between Catholics , notably in Flanders , who broadly supported his return , and Socialists , in Wallonia and Brussels , who were strongly opposed to it . After a general strike and an indecisive referendum , the king resigned in favour of his son , Baudouin , in 1950 . 
 = = = Commemoration = = = 
 In the decades following the war , large numbers of public memorials were erected around the country in memory of Belgian soldiers who had died fighting for the Allied cause during the conflict . There are numerous monuments and streets dedicated to Allied politicians and generals , including Franklin Roosevelt and Bernard Montgomery in Brussels . The large numbers of British and American cemeteries and memorials , particularly in the Ardennes region associated with the Battle of the Bulge , meant that the legacy of the war was very visible . 
 In common with other countries , there are numerous veterans ' associations ( known as " <unk> " or " Amicale " in French ) and Belgian towns , particularly Bastogne , are frequently visited by veterans from other countries . There are also numerous war museums around the country , including the Royal Museum of the Army and Military History in Brussels , which aim to inform the public about the war . The Holocaust is commemorated in Belgium by both memorials and museums ; the prison at Fort Breendonk has been preserved as a museum and has been open to the public since 1947 . Since the passing of the Holocaust denial law in 1995 , it is illegal to deny the holocaust . 
 The participation of soldiers from the Belgian Congo was , however , largely forgotten following Congolese independence in 1960 and decades of subsequent war . In recent years the profile of the veterans has been raised by exhibitions creating greater public awareness .

 Dustin Eli Whiteside ( born October 22 , 1979 ) is an American former professional baseball catcher . He stands 6 feet 2 inches ( 1 @.@ 88 m ) tall , weighs 220 pounds ( 100 kg ) . He batted and threw right @-@ handed . He played in Major League Baseball for the Baltimore Orioles , San Francisco Giants , and Chicago Cubs . 
 Whiteside attended Delta State University before being drafted in the sixth round of the Major League Baseball ( MLB ) Draft by the Baltimore Orioles . He played in their organization through 2007 , though he only played nine games in the major leagues with the Orioles , all coming in 2005 . He signed with the Minnesota Twins in 2008 but was released after playing for their Triple @-@ A team for a month . The San Francisco Giants then signed him , assigning him to the minor leagues . He was called up to be their backup catcher in May 2009 , and he caught Jonathan Sánchez 's no @-@ hitter on July 10 . In 2010 , he remained the backup catcher and was on the Giants ' roster when they won the World Series , despite not playing any playoff games . After an injury to Buster Posey in May 2011 , Whiteside split time catching with Chris Stewart for the rest of the year . He lost the role of backup to Héctor Sánchez in 2012 and appeared in just 12 games for the Giants during their second World Series @-@ winning season in three years . Following 2012 , Whiteside was claimed off waivers multiple times by different clubs before finally winding up with the Texas Rangers , who assigned him to their Triple @-@ A team in 2013 . In 2014 , he competed for a spot on the Cubs ' roster but was beaten out by John Baker and sent to the minors . In early 2015 , Whiteside decided to retire and currently serves as a coach on the Giants .

 Whiteside began his minor league career in 2001 with the Single @-@ A Delmarva Shorebirds of the South Atlantic League . In 61 games ( 212 at bats ) , he batted .250 with 53 hits , seven home runs , and 28 runs batted in ( RBI ) . He finished second on the club in home runs and had a caught stealing percentage of 41 % . Next season , he played for both the Single @-@ A advanced Frederick Keys of the Carolina League and the Double @-@ A Bowie Baysox of the Eastern League . He spent most of the season with Frederick , batting .259 with 89 hits , eight home runs , and 42 RBI in 80 games ( 313 at bats ) . In 27 games ( 99 at bats ) with Bowie , he hit .263 with 26 hits , two home runs , and 11 RBI . His combined totals for the two leagues were 107 hits , 10 home runs , and 53 RBI in 107 games ( 412 at bats ) . 
 Outside of a rehab assignment , Whiteside spent all of 2003 with Bowie . In 81 games ( 265 at bats ) , he batted .204 with 54 hits , one home run , and 23 RBI . Defensively , he had a .989 fielding percentage and threw out 37 % of baserunners . In 2004 , Whiteside again played with Bowie . He had two @-@ home @-@ run games against the Akron Aeros on May 17 and the Erie SeaWolves on July 28 , finishing fourth in the Orioles ' organization on the season with 18 home runs . He batted .279 before the Eastern League All @-@ Star break but hit just .206 afterwards . In 90 games ( 297 at bats ) , he hit .253 with 75 hits . Defensively , he posted a .986 fielding percentage . He batted .310 in away games as opposed to .187 in home games . Following the season , he played for the Peoria Javelinas of the Arizona Fall League , batting .329 with 20 RBI in 18 games . 
 Whiteside moved up to the Triple @-@ A Ottawa Lynx of the International League in 2005 , and the Orioles signed veteran catcher Sal Fasano to mentor him . On July 4 , Whiteside was called up by the Orioles after Gerónimo Gil was placed on the disabled list . He made his major league debut the next day , entering as a defensive replacement for Fasano in a 12 – 3 loss to the New York Yankees . Four days later , making his first major league start , he got his first hit , an RBI single against Scott Cassidy in a 9 – 1 victory over the Boston Red Sox . He appeared in six games and committed two throwing errors , one of which was important . On July 19 , he made a wild throw to second base on a stolen base attempt that put Joe Mauer in position to score the tying run from third on a wild pitch in a 4 – 3 loss to the Minnesota Twins . Whiteside was sent back to Ottawa on July 25 when Javy López came off the disabled list . In 95 games ( 317 at bats ) with Ottawa , Whiteside hit .233 with 74 hits , four home runs , and 27 RBI while posting a caught stealing percentage of 40 % . He was also called up in September , appearing in three more games . In nine games ( 12 at bats ) with the Orioles , Whiteside had three hits and one RBI . 
 Whiteside was considered a " long shot " to make the Orioles ' roster in 2006 , but he remained in spring training with the Orioles until they made their final cuts on April 1 and sent him to Ottawa . On May 21 , Whiteside had four RBI in a game against the Rochester Red Wings , and he had back @-@ to @-@ back three @-@ hit games against the Norfolk Tides from July 23 through 24 . In 92 games ( 315 at bats ) with Ottawa in 2006 , Whiteside batted .244 with 77 hits , 11 home runs , and 47 RBI . His batting average was .281 at home compared to .201 on the road . In 2007 , Whiteside attended spring training but was reassigned to the minors on March 27 , coinciding with the Orioles ' acquisition of Alberto Castillo . Whiteside began the season with the Orioles ' Triple @-@ A affiliate , which was now the Norfolk Tides , but after he batted <unk> in 18 games he was reassigned to Bowie on May 11 . He spent time on the disabled list from June 18 through July 12 with a fractured right cheekbone . Upon returning , he had a seven @-@ game hitting streak , but he was lost for the season on August 6 after suffering a concussion . In 42 games ( 141 at bats ) with Bowie , Whiteside hit .291 with 41 hits , four home runs , and 30 RBI . After 2007 , he filed for free agency , having played in only nine major league games during his seven years with the Orioles .

 Five days after getting released by the Twins , the San Francisco Giants signed Whiteside . He spent the rest of the year with the Triple @-@ A Fresno Grizzlies of the Pacific Coast League . In 49 games , the most by any catcher with Fresno in 2008 , Whiteside batted .238 with 36 hits , two home runs , and 22 RBI . He had a .986 fielding percentage but only threw out seven percent of attempted base @-@ stealers . In 57 games ( 175 at bats ) between Rochester and Fresno , he hit .229 with 40 hits , three home runs , and 23 RBI . 
 The next season , Whiteside started the year at Fresno again , batting .241 with 28 hits , six home runs , and 24 RBI in 34 games ( 116 at bats ) . However , after an elbow injury prevented Pablo Sandoval from catching , the Giants called up Whiteside to be the backup catcher for Bengie Molina on May 24 , 2009 . The same day , he played his first major league game in four years ( and his first for a National League team ) . He finished the game with a hit and an RBI in three at @-@ bats . Matt Cain said of Whiteside , " He 's been great . He 's a guy who definitely takes advantage of his days in between , when he 's not catching , and asking what guys threw in situations and what the pitches were , so he isn 't thrown into the fire the days he 's starting . Even if he doesn 't see a team , he 's still figuring out how guys got them out . He 's definitely always learning . " On July 10 , 2009 , Molina was scheduled to catch , but was unable to because he went to see his wife , who was having a baby . Whiteside caught in his place , and Jonathan Sánchez , starting in place of the injured Randy Johnson , threw a no @-@ hitter against the San Diego Padres . When asked if he thought it was more unlikely for Sánchez to throw a no @-@ hitter or for him to catch it , he said , " Probably me catching one . " He hit a grand slam , his first Major League home run , against Brian <unk> of the Houston Astros in a 10 – 6 Giants ' victory on August 5 , 2009 . He joined Bobby Bonds , Dave Kingman , and Brian Dallimore as the only Giants to hit a grand slam for their first home run . He finished the year with 29 hits in 49 games ( 126 at @-@ bats ) , two home runs , and 13 RBI . Defensively , he posted a <unk> fielding percentage while catching 39 % of attempted base stealers . 
 In 2010 , for the first time in his career , Whiteside made an MLB team out of spring training . He served as Sánchez 's personal catcher for much of the season , catching 19 of his starts . Following Molina 's trade to the Texas Rangers on June 30 , Whiteside saw his playing time reduced as Buster Posey caught more and more games ; Whiteside would only start six of the Giants ' final 57 games . He finished the regular season with a .238 batting average , appearing in 73 games . Though Whiteside did not appear in any playoff games , he was on the team 's roster throughout the playoffs , earning his first career championship title after the Giants won the series against the Rangers . 
 In 2011 , Whiteside again began the year as the backup catcher . However , following Posey 's season @-@ ending leg injury on May 25 , 2011 , he moved into a more prominent role , splitting starting time with Chris Stewart . On June 22 , he had two hits ( including a triple ) and a season @-@ high three RBI in a 5 – 2 victory over the Twins .

Most of the concert 's set list originates from Good Girl Gone Bad , however , Rihanna also performed songs from her previous albums Music of the Sun ( 2005 ) and A Girl like Me ( 2006 ) . It also contains a special Documentary Feature that presents Rihanna discussing her experiences during the tour . 
 Critics were divided on Good Girl Gone Bad Live ; they praised the show , dancers , Rihanna 's vocals and contrast levels of the video , however , there was criticism towards some technicalities including the close @-@ up frames . At the 2009 Grammy Awards , the video album received a Grammy nomination for Best Long Form Music Video .

 Following the release of her two studio albums Music of the Sun ( 2005 ) and A Girl like Me ( 2006 ) , in late 2006 Rihanna started working with songwriters and producers on her third studio album . She worked with some of the producers who were involved on her previous albums including Evan Rogers and Carl Sturken , Ne @-@ Yo , J.R. Rotem , Sean Garrett and Norwegian duo Stargate . Rihanna also collaborated with new music producers on the album such as Timbaland and will.i.am. Most of the album tracks were recorded in Westlake Recording Studios in Los Angeles , California , parallel to the recording sessions of her second studio album , A Girl like Me . Rihanna began working on the album in late 2006 and was almost finished recording in late February 2007 . On June 4 , 2007 she released the album under the name Good Girl Gone Bad . During an interview with MTV News , Rihanna explained the meaning and reasoning behind the album 's title : 
 We figured Good Girl Gone Bad was the perfect title because it showed people I 'm my own [ person ] now . Not doing what anyone wants me to do . I 'm not the innocent Rihanna anymore . I 'm taking a lot more risks and chances . I felt when I cut my hair , it shows people I 'm not trying to look or be anybody else . The album is very edgy . We have some urban records , some really pop records . " 
 Upon its release , Good Girl Gone Bad received generally positive reviews from most music critics and earned Rihanna a Grammy Award for Best Rap / Sung Collaboration for the lead single " Umbrella " . It became a huge commercial success and spawned eight singles that attained chart success .

Ahmad concluded that even the " cringey " American pronunciation of " Manchester " and associated drivel can 't take away the vocal strength of " Rehab " . He further praised the interlude " Scratch " calling it " impressive " .

" A reviewer of Blu @-@ ray.com was more critical stating that even though the transfer does not has serious technical flaws , the video can not pair to Live from the Royal Albert Hall ( 2009 ) by American rock band The Killers .

 = The Murders in the Rue Morgue = 
 " The Murders in the Rue Morgue " is a short story by Edgar Allan Poe published in Graham 's Magazine in 1841 . It has been recognized as the first modern detective story ; Poe referred to it as one of his " tales of ratiocination " . Two works that share some similarities predate Poe 's stories , including Das Fräulein von Scuderi ( 1819 ) by E. T. A. Hoffmann and Zadig ( 1747 ) by Voltaire . 
 C. Auguste Dupin is a man in Paris who solves the mystery of the brutal murder of two women . Numerous witnesses heard a suspect , though no one agrees on what language was spoken . At the murder scene , Dupin finds a hair that does not appear to be human . 
 As the first fictional detective , Poe 's Dupin displays many traits which became literary conventions in subsequent fictional detectives , including Sherlock Holmes and Hercule Poirot . Many later characters , for example , follow Poe 's model of the brilliant detective , his personal friend who serves as narrator , and the final revelation being presented before the reasoning that leads up to it . Dupin himself reappears in " The Mystery of Marie Rogêt " and " The <unk> Letter " . 
 = = Plot summary = = 
 The story surrounds the baffling double murder of Madame L <unk> and her daughter at their home in the Rue Morgue , a fictional street in Paris . According to newspaper accounts , the mother was found in a yard behind the house , with multiple broken bones and her throat so deeply cut that her head fell off when the body was moved . The daughter was found strangled to death and stuffed upside down into a chimney . The murders occurred in a fourth @-@ floor room that was locked from the inside ; on the floor were found a bloody straight razor , several bloody tufts of gray hair , and two bags of gold coins . Several witnesses reported hearing two voices at the time of the murder , one male and French , but disagreed on the language spoken by the other . The speech was unclear , and every witness admits that he does not know the language he claims to have heard . 
 Paris natives Dupin and his friend , the unnamed narrator of the story , read these newspaper accounts with interest . The two live in seclusion and allow no visitors . They have cut off contact with " former associates " and venture outside only at night . " We existed within ourselves alone " , the narrator explains . When a bank clerk named Adolphe Le Bon is arrested even though no evidence exists pointing to his guilt , Dupin becomes intrigued and remembers a service that Le Bon once performed for him . He decides to offer his assistance to " G – " , the prefect of police . 
 Because none of the witnesses can agree on the language the murderer spoke , Dupin concludes they were not hearing a human voice at all . He and the narrator examine the house thoroughly ; the following day , Dupin dismisses the idea of both Le Bon 's guilt and a robbery motive , citing the fact that the gold was not taken from the room . He formulates a method by which the murderer could have entered the room and killed both women , involving an agile climb up a lightning rod and a leap to a set of open window shutters . Showing an unusual tuft of hair he recovered from the scene , and demonstrating the impossibility of the daughter being strangled by a human hand , Dupin concludes that an " <unk> @-@ <unk> " ( orangutan ) killed the women . He has placed an advertisement in the local newspaper asking if anyone has lost such an animal , and a sailor soon arrives looking for it . 
 The sailor offers to pay a reward , but Dupin is interested only in learning the circumstances behind the two murders . The sailor explains that he captured the orangutan while in Borneo and brought it back to Paris , but had trouble keeping it under control . When he saw the orangutan attempting to shave its face with his straight razor , imitating his morning grooming , it fled into the streets and reached the Rue Morgue , where it climbed up and into the house . The orangutan seized the mother by the hair and was waving the razor , imitating a barber ; when she screamed in fear , it flew into a rage , ripped her hair out , slashed her throat , and strangled the daughter . The sailor climbed up the lightning rod in an attempt to catch the animal , and the two voices heard by witnesses belonged to it and to him . Fearing punishment by its master , the orangutan threw the mother 's body out the window and stuffed the daughter into the chimney before fleeing . 
 The sailor sells the orangutan , Le Bon is released from custody , and the prefect of police mentions that people should mind their own business once Dupin tells him the story . Dupin comments to the narrator that G – is " somewhat too cunning to be profound " , but admires his ability " de <unk> ce qui est , et d <unk> ce qui n 'est pas " ( a quote from Julie , or the New Heloise by Jean @-@ Jacques Rousseau : " to deny that which is , and explore that which is not " ) . 
 = = Themes and analysis = = 
 In a letter to friend Dr. Joseph Snodgrass , Poe said of " The Murders in the Rue Morgue " , " its theme was the exercise of ingenuity in detecting a murderer . " Dupin is not a professional detective ; he decides to investigate the murders in the Rue Morgue for his personal amusement . He also has a desire for truth and to prove a falsely accused man innocent . His interests are not financial and he even declines a monetary reward from the owner of the orangutan . The revelation of the actual murderer removes the crime , as neither the orangutan nor its owner can be held responsible . Later detective stories would have set up M. Le Bon , the suspect who is arrested , as appearing guilty as a red herring , though Poe chose not to . 
 Poe wrote " The Murders in the Rue Morgue " at a time when crime was at the forefront in people 's minds due to urban development . London had recently established its first professional police force and American cities were beginning to focus on scientific police work as newspapers reported murders and criminal trials . " The Murders in the Rue Morgue " continues an urban theme that was used several times in Poe 's fiction , in particular " The Man of the Crowd " , likely inspired by Poe 's time living in Philadelphia . 
 The tale has an underlying metaphor for the battle of brains vs. brawn . Physical strength , depicted as the orangutan as well as its owner , stand for violence : the orangutan is a murderer , while its owner admits he has abused the animal with a whip . The analyst 's brainpower overcomes their violence . The story also contains Poe 's often @-@ used theme of the death of a beautiful woman , which he called the " most poetical topic in the world " . 
 = = = Dupin 's method = = = 
 Poe defines Dupin 's method , ratiocination , using the example of a card player : " the extent of information obtained ; lies not so much in the validity of the inference as in the quality of the observation . " Poe then provides a narrative example where Dupin explains how he knew the narrator was thinking about the actor Chantilly . Dupin then applies his method to the solving of this crime . 
 Dupin 's method emphasizes the importance of reading and the written word . The newspaper accounts pique his curiosity ; he learns about orangutans from a written account by " Cuvier " — likely Georges Cuvier , the French zoologist . This method also engages the reader , who follows along by reading the clues himself . Poe also emphasizes the power of the spoken word . When Dupin asks the sailor for information about the murders , the sailor himself acts out a partial death : " The sailor 's face flushed up as if he were struggling with suffocation ... the next moment he fell back into his seat , trembling violently , and with the countenance of death itself . " 
 = = Literary significance and reception = = 
 Poe biographer Jeffrey Meyers sums up the significance of " The Murders in the Rue Morgue " : " [ it ] changed the history of world literature . " Often cited as the first detective fiction story , the character of Dupin became the prototype for many future fictional detectives , including Arthur Conan Doyle 's Sherlock Holmes and Agatha Christie 's Hercule Poirot . The genre is distinctive from a general mystery story in that the focus is on analysis . Poe 's role in the creation of the detective story is reflected in the Edgar Awards , given annually by the Mystery Writers of America . 
 " The Murders in the Rue Morgue " also established many tropes that would become common elements in mystery fiction : the eccentric but brilliant detective , the bumbling constabulary , the first @-@ person narration by a close personal friend . Poe also portrays the police in an unsympathetic manner as a sort of foil to the detective . Poe also initiates the storytelling device where the detective announces his solution and then explains the reasoning leading up to it . It is also the first locked room mystery in detective fiction . 
 Upon its release , " The Murders in the Rue Morgue " and its author were praised for the creation of a new profound novelty . The Pennsylvania Inquirer printed that " it proves Mr Poe to be a man of genius ... with an inventive power and skill , of which we know no parallel . " Poe , however , downplayed his achievement in a letter to Philip Pendleton Cooke : 
 These tales of ratiocination owe most of their popularity to being something in a new key . I do not mean to say that they are not ingenious – but people think them more ingenious than they are – on account of their method and air of method . In the " Murders in the Rue Morgue " , for instance , where is the ingenuity in unraveling a web which you yourself ... have woven for the express purpose of unraveling ? " 
 Modern readers are occasionally put off by Poe 's violation of an implicit narrative convention : readers should be able to guess the solution as they read . The twist ending , however , is a sign of " bad faith " on Poe 's part because readers would not reasonably include an orangutan on their list of potential murderers . 
 = = Inspiration = = 
 The word detective did not exist at the time Poe wrote " The Murders in the Rue Morgue " , though there were other stories that featured similar problem @-@ solving characters . Das Fräulein von Scuderi ( 1819 ) , by E. T. A. Hoffmann , in which Mlle. de Scuderi , a kind of 19th @-@ century Miss Marple , establishes the innocence of the police 's favorite suspect in the murder of a jeweler , is sometimes cited as the first detective story . Other forerunners include Voltaire 's Zadig ( 1748 ) , with a main character who performs similar feats of analysis , themselves borrowed from The Three Princes of <unk> , an Italian rendition of Amir <unk> 's " <unk> @-@ <unk> " . 
 Poe may also have been expanding on previous analytical works of his own including the essay on " <unk> 's Chess Player " and the comedic " Three Sundays in a Week " . As for the twist in the plot , Poe was likely inspired by the crowd reaction to an orangutan on display at the Masonic Hall in Philadelphia in July 1839 . The name of the main character may have been inspired from the " Dupin " character in a series of stories first published in Burton 's Gentleman 's Magazine in 1828 called " Unpublished passages in the Life of Vidocq , the French Minister of Police " . Poe would likely have known the story , which features an analytical man who discovers a murderer , though the two plots share little resemblance . Murder victims in both stories , however , have their neck cut so badly that the head is almost entirely removed from the body . Dupin actually mentions Vidocq by name , dismissing him as " a good <unk> " . 
 = = Publication history = = 
 Poe originally titled the story " Murders in the Rue Trianon " but renamed it to better associate with death . " The Murders in the Rue Morgue " first appeared in Graham 's Magazine in April 1841 while Poe was working as an editor . He was paid an additional $ 56 for it — an unusually high figure ; he was only paid $ 9 for " The Raven " . In 1843 , Poe had the idea to print a series of pamphlets with his stories entitled The Prose Romances of Edgar A. Poe . He printed only one , " The Murders in the Rue Morgue " oddly collected with the satirical " The Man That Was Used Up " . It sold for 12 and a half cents . This version included 52 changes from the original text from Graham 's , including the new line : " The Prefect is somewhat too cunning to be profound " , a change from the original " too cunning to be acute " . " The Murders in the Rue Morgue " was also reprinted in Wiley & Putnam 's collection of Poe 's stories simply called Tales . Poe did not take part in selecting which tales would be collected . 
 Poe 's sequel to " The Murders in the Rue Morgue " was " The Mystery of Marie Rogêt " , first serialized in December 1842 and January 1843 . Though subtitled " A Sequel to ' The Murders in the Rue Morgue ' " , " The Mystery of Marie Rogêt " shares very few common elements with " The Murders in the Rue Morgue " beyond the inclusion of C. Auguste Dupin and the Paris setting . Dupin reappeared in " The <unk> Letter " , which Poe called " perhaps the best of my tales of ratiocination " in a letter to James Russell Lowell in July 1844 . 
 The original manuscript of " The Murders in the Rue Morgue " which was used for its first printing in Graham 's Magazine was discarded in a wastebasket . An apprentice at the office , J. M. Johnston , retrieved it and left it with his father for safekeeping . It was left in a music book , where it survived three house fires before being bought by George William Childs . In 1891 , Childs presented the manuscript , re @-@ bound with a letter explaining its history , to Drexel University . Childs had also donated $ 650 for the completion of Edgar Allan Poe 's new grave monument in Baltimore , Maryland in 1875 . 
 " The Murders in the Rue Morgue " was one of the earliest of Poe 's works to be translated into French . Between June 11 and June 13 , 1846 , " Un <unk> sans <unk> dans les <unk> de la Justice " was published in La Quotidienne , a Paris newspaper . Poe 's name was not mentioned and many details , including the name of the Rue Morgue and the main characters ( " Dupin " became " Bernier " ) , were changed . On October 12 , 1846 , another uncredited translation , renamed " Une <unk> <unk> " , was published in Le Commerce . The editor of Le Commerce was accused of plagiarizing the story from La Quotidienne . The accusation went to trial and the public discussion brought Poe 's name to the attention of the French public .

 " The Murders in the Rue Morgue " has been adapted for radio , film and television many times . 
 The first film adaptation was a short silent film made in 1914 . [ 1 ] .

 = Danielle Rousseau = 
 Danielle Rousseau is a fictional character on the ABC drama television series Lost , which chronicles the lives of over forty people after their plane crashes on a remote island somewhere in the South Pacific . Croatian actress Mira Furlan plays the scientist who shipwrecks on the island sixteen years prior to the crash of Oceanic Flight 815 . After Rousseau is killed in the fourth season , the American actress Melissa Farman portrayed a younger version of the character in the fifth season . Furlan later reappears for one episode in the sixth season . Rousseau is a recurring on @-@ island character who has appeared in nineteen episodes in seasons one through four , as well as one episode where her voice alone is heard , and her final episode in the sixth season . 
 The character , who is commonly known as " The French Woman " among the survivors on the island , is introduced early in the first season . Sixteen years prior to the plane crash , Rousseau was a member of a French research vessel , whose ship ran aground on the island . Two months after being stranded , Rousseau gave birth to her daughter Alex ( Tania Raymonde ) ; however , Alex was taken by the island 's original inhabitants , a group which Rousseau called the " Others " . Rousseau 's primary objective is to reunite with her daughter , which is achieved in the season three finale " Through the Looking Glass " . The reunion is short @-@ lived ; Rousseau is shot and killed by a band of mercenaries in the middle of the fourth season . 
 The writers wrote Rousseau out of the series upon request by Furlan , who did not wish to travel to Hawaii to film her scenes , although she later called this an untrue rumor . The producers planned for Rousseau to get her own flashback episode in season four ; however , this was delayed due to the 2007 – 2008 Writers Guild of America strike . The writers stated that Rousseau would be in the fifth season , and her story would be told , but to say that it would be told through a flashback would be " disingenuous " . In the fifth season of Lost , a younger version of Rousseau is shown . Critical reaction to the character has been generally positive ; however , many have expressed disappointment in the execution of Rousseau 's death scene .

 = = = Prior to the crash = = = 
 Sixteen years before Oceanic 815 crashes on the island , Rousseau was a heavily pregnant member of a six @-@ person crew aboard a French research vessel three days out of Tahiti . The crew picked up a radio signal emanating from the South Pacific , which was a repeating set of six numbers : 4 , 8 , 15 , 16 , 23 and 42 . While attempting to find the source of the signal , the ship ran aground on rocks surrounding the island . Before reaching the shore , Rousseau and her team found Oceanic 815 survivor Jin @-@ Soo Kwon ( Daniel Dae Kim ) in the water , who had been time @-@ travelling as a result of the time shifts which had been moving him and the flight survivors through the island 's history . 
 Rousseau later tells the survivors of Oceanic 815 that two months after their arrival , that the island natives , which she called the Others , carried a disease that the rest of her crew had contracted . She believed that this disease could not be allowed to reach the rest of the world , so she killed her colleagues , including her husband Robert . When Jin time @-@ travels to the past , he witnesses a different version of Rousseau 's past . It is shown that the Smoke Monster , not the Others , was responsible for the " sickness " that forced her to kill her crew . Rousseau confronts the father of her child , Robert , at gunpoint and accuses him of " being changed " inside the temple . Robert denies this , explaining that the Monster is a security system for the temple , and convinces Rousseau to lower her weapon . He attempts to shoot her when she does , but is shot by Rousseau . Rousseau also attempts to kill Jin , having witnessed him vanish moments after her team entered the Smoke Monster 's lair , believing he has the disease . 
 Rousseau hiked to the radio tower and changed the message from the numbers to a repeating distress call . Three days later , Rousseau gave birth to a daughter , Alexandra . One week after Alex 's birth , Benjamin Linus ( Michael Emerson ) came and took Alex from Rousseau . Ben told Rousseau that the child would be safe with them , and that she was lucky for being left alive . Before leaving , Ben tells her that if she hears whispers , she should run the other way . After this , Rousseau began setting traps in the jungle with the hope of catching one of the people responsible for Alex 's kidnapping . 
 = = = After the crash = = = 
 Rousseau makes her first appearance in the season one episode " Solitary " , where she captures Sayid ( Naveen Andrews ) , one of the plane crash survivors . Rousseau tortures him until he eventually convinces her that he is not one of the Others . She allows Sayid to return to his camp , and cautions him to keep a close eye on the other survivors . Over two weeks later , she comes across a delirious Claire ( Emilie de Ravin ) , who had been left in the jungle after being kidnapped by the Others . Noticing that Claire 's shouting is alerting the Others to her presence , Rousseau knocks her unconscious and carries her back to the other survivors . Rousseau makes her next appearance in " Numbers " , where she shoots at Charlie ( Dominic Monaghan ) and Hurley ( Jorge Garcia ) , suspecting them of being Others . In the season one finale , set 43 days after the plane crash , Rousseau arrives on the beach and warns everyone that the Others are coming . After Claire gives birth to her son Aaron , Rousseau steals him and intends to swap him for her own child . When the Others do not come , Rousseau reluctantly returns him to Sayid . In season two , set two weeks later , Rousseau informs Sayid that she has caught one of the Others , who later turns out to be Ben . Later , Rousseau joins Claire and Kate Austen ( Evangeline Lilly ) who are searching for medicine for Claire 's baby , in one of the Others ' work stations . Disappointed that she has not found any trace of Alex , she begins to leave them when Claire tells her that she believes Alex helped her escape when the Others captured her . 
 Midway through season three , Kate persuades Rousseau to help some of the survivors find the Others ' home , by informing her that Alex helped her escape from the Others . When they arrive , Rousseau abandons the group and watches from the bushes as Alex walks past . A few days later , Rousseau leads the survivors to the radio tower in order for them to contact a nearby freighter . En route , they encounter Ben and Alex ; Ben explains to . Season four begins with the survivors dividing into two groups , with those who believe the people from the freighter to be dangerous , including Rousseau and Alex , joining Locke ( Terry O 'Quinn ) . After learning of the freighter crew 's intentions to kill everyone on the island , Ben directs Rousseau , along with Alex and her boyfriend Karl ( Blake Bashoff ) , to head to the Temple where the rest of the Others are located . On their way , Rousseau and Karl are shot by unseen attackers , and both are killed . The buried bodies of both are discovered by Miles ( Ken Leung ) , Sawyer ( Josh Holloway ) , and Claire after they leave Locke and travel back to the beach .

 Rousseau is named after French @-@ Swiss philosopher Jean @-@ Jacques Rousseau . Although Rousseau is French , actress Mira Furlan is Croatian , which led to speculation that Rousseau is not really from France . In one of the official Lost podcasts , producer Carlton Cuse joked , " any French woman who speaks with a Croatian accent and has been living in the woods for sixteen years eating bugs ... has got some issues , and those issues need to be overcome before she can actually go and embrace Alex " . Furlan understood Rousseau 's decision to not meet her daughter , believing that no one can ever be prepared for that moment . Furlan met Raymonde for the first time just minutes before shooting their reunion scene in the season three finale . The actors believed the scene to be a " huge moment " for their characters , which Furlan described as a " basic human moment . " Furlan was glad to have " such a beautiful partner , " and noted their physical resemblance . 
 Furlan is said to have asked for her character to be written out of the series because she did not want to travel to Hawaii to film her scenes , although she later called this an untrue rumor . The producers decided for Rousseau to be shot , with the possibility of her returning in season five . Co @-@ show runners and executive producers Damon Lindelof and Cuse originally intended for Rousseau to get her own flashback episode in season four , however as a result of the Writer 's Strike , this did not come to pass . When asked whether Rousseau would have a flashback in season five , Lindelof said that Rousseau 's story would " definitively " be revealed , but that " to use the word flashback would be disingenuous " . Cuse revealed that they were trying to steer away from the word flashback and were " embracing a whole new word " . He explained that " there will still [ ... ] be flashbacks and flash @-@ forwards on the show , but we 're going to do something different this year . We 're going to mix it up . " Instead of using flashbacks and flashforwards like in previous seasons , stories of the fifth season will play out both on and off the island stories in different points in time . The writers were supposedly scheduling an appearance by Furlan for the fifth season , but Furlan did not end up making an appearance . However , she returns in the form of Rousseau 's " sideways " counterpart ( who never crashed on the Island , lost Alex or went insane ) in the sixth season . 
 = = Reception = = 
 In a review of the first season episode " Solitary " , Chris Carabott of IGN commented that Rousseau appeared to be more emotionally fragile than in later seasons , and was like a " loose cannon " . Carabott found that as the series progressed and the mystery around the character was lessened , Rousseau was unable to deliver the same impact she made in her first appearance . In his review of " Numbers " , in which Rousseau makes her second appearance , Carabott described Hurley and Rousseau 's encounter as " the episode 's best moment " , as " Hurley finds comfort with someone who we would least expect . " Lost co @-@ creator J.J. Abrams commended Furlan for giving the character " heart and soul " , and managed to make her " identifiable and complex " . 
 Rousseau 's unknown fate in " Meet Kevin Johnson " was heavily discussed among critics . Alan Sepinwall of The Star @-@ Ledger felt that the relationship between Rousseau and Alex after their reunion remained unexplored , which made Rousseau 's death a wasted opportunity for a powerful death scene . BuddyTV 's Don Williams believed that Rousseau would survive , mainly because he had been waiting to see her flashback for four seasons , and thought her death would ensure it would not happen . Dan Compora from SyFy Portal was disappointed in her death scene , noting , " I wasn 't shocked to see Danielle get killed , but the scene felt like it was tossed in just in case this had to serve as the season finale . " Compora felt that Rousseau deserved more screen time in the episode leading up to her death . The San Francisco Chronicle 's Tim Goodman described it as " a rude and lazy way to get rid of Rousseau " . John Kubicek , also of BuddyTV , found her death scene unsatisfactory , commenting , " Then we have that entirely tacked on scene at the end which felt so artificial , like I accidentally flipped over to a different show . While I agree Danielle Rousseau being shot with an arrow is shocking , is this really what the show has come to ? <unk> putting a recurring character 's life in peril to pose as a cliffhanger ? "

 = Günther Specht = 
 Günther Specht ( 13 November 1914 – 1 January 1945 ) was a German Luftwaffe fighter ace during World War II . 
 Having joined the Luftwaffe in 1935 and completed his pilot training , at the start of the war Specht was a Leutnant in 3 . / ZG 26 " Horst Wessel " ( the 3rd squadron of the 26th Heavy Fighter Wing ) . In 1939 he was wounded by an RAF tail gunner and blinded in one eye . He returned to active duty and was shot down six times during the war . After his recovery in 1939 , he chose to return to active service but was shot down again in France and was seriously injured . These injuries kept him grounded for the next two years . In 1942 he returned to active duty with 1st Fighter Wing ( Jagdgeschwader 1 Oesau ; JG 1 ) ) . He was then made Group Commander ( Gruppenkommandeur ) of II Group of JG 11 ( II . / JG 11 ) and promoted to Major . He was appointed as Wing Commander ( Geschwaderkommodore ) of JG 11 and was listed as missing in action during the attack on the Allied bases at Asch and Ophoven as part of Operation Bodenplatte . He was posthumously promoted to lieutenant colonel ( German : Oberstleutnant ) and was recommended for the Oak Leaves ( German : Eichenlaub ) to the Knight 's Cross , which was never actioned amongst all the confusion in the last months of the war . 
 Specht was considered as one of the best fighter leaders during the war and was a recipient of the Knight 's Cross of the Iron Cross ( German : Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes ) . During his combat career he was credited with 34 enemy aircraft destroyed , all downed on the Western Front . 
 = = Personality = = 
 Specht was born on 13 November 1914 in Frankenstein ( modern <unk> <unk> ) of Prussia ( modern Poland ) . Specht was short in stature but full of energy . He had a distinguishing patch of gray in his hair just above his forehead . He was a perfectionist with a high sense of duty , and expected his men to follow his high standards . Although he lost his left eye in late 1939 , according to Squadron Leader ( German : Staffelkapitän ) Heinz Knoke of 5 . / JG 11 , he could see like a vulture and was an excellent marksman . Specht also had an eye for detail , and he wrote detailed mission log reports for future use . 
 Specht 's personal emblems adorning his aircraft included a design by Specht of a pencil superimposed on a chevron ( termed a winged pencil ) as a wry comment on being <unk> following his injuries . His single @-@ engine aircraft with JG 11 sported a green spinner and a Knight 's Cross painted on the cowling after he was awarded the honour in April 1944 . 
 Specht would not allow women on the group base , considering them an unnecessary diversion . According to Knoke , one time Specht 's wife came to visit him on the II . / JG 11 base but was held at the guard room on Specht 's orders and refused to receive calls from the guard . Instead he asked Knoke to pass a message to her to ' put herself on ice ' , saying that he would only have time for her after the war . Specht however did not survive , dying five months before the war in Europe came to an end . 
 = = = Formation leadership = = = 
 After taking command of II . / JG 11 , Specht led the group on every mission in which it participated . Following each mission , he wrote detailed and analytical mission reports . He soon gained a reputation as one of the most reliable formation leaders , with II . / JG 11 reputed to be one of the best units among the fighter force ( German : <unk> ) on Reich air defense ( German : <unk> ) . 
 On 17 August 1943 Specht led the group from Gilze en Rijen on an intercept and sighted the B @-@ 17 Flying Fortresses of 381 Bombing Group near Antwerp . He waited for 30 minutes until the escorts turned back at Eupen before attacking . Within the next half hour , sixty percent of the bombers went down . Specht himself was credited with downing two as his 16th and 17th victories . 
 On 11 September 1944 Specht and the JG 11 Headquarters @-@ flight ( German : Stabsschwarm ) led a combined formation of II . / JG 4 ( Sturm ) ( German : <unk> ) and III . / JG 4 . Due to Specht 's skills , they positioned themselves against thirty @-@ four B @-@ 17s of the " Bloody 100th " and fifteen B @-@ 17s were downed before the escorting P @-@ 51s arrived . Specht was credited with one P @-@ 51 . 
 = = Military career = = 
 Having joined the Luftwaffe in 1935 and completed his pilot training , when war started in September 1939 Specht was a Leutnant in 3 . / ZG 26 " Horst Wessel " ( the 3rd squadron of the 26th Heavy Fighter Wing ) . Supposedly equipped with the new , twin @-@ engine , Bf 110 heavy fighter , its production was so far behind schedule that 7 of the 10 <unk> ( including Specht ’ s I. / ZG 26 ) had to be equipped with old Messerschmitt Bf <unk> and D single @-@ engined fighters . They thus took no role in the Polish campaign , instead based on the North Sea coast near Wilhelmshaven . 
 This was virtually the only part of the Western Front , during the Phoney War , where there was significant aerial activity in the early months of the war , as RAF bombers flew unescorted raids on the German naval bases . So it did not take long for Specht to score his first victories : two Handley Page Hampden medium bombers in a squadron conducting an armed reconnaissance operation near Heligoland , shot down on 29 September . Needing a long @-@ range fighter to better intercept the British bombers at distance , I. / ZG 26 was thus the next Gruppe selected for re @-@ equipping onto the Bf 110 . 
 On 3 December 1939 , 24 RAF Vickers Wellington bombers from Marham and Mildenhall bases attacked Heligoland . These were intercepted by I. / ZG 26 along with other Messerschmitt Bf 109 units . Specht scored his third victory , shooting down a bomber over the North Sea . But he was also seriously injured by return fire from the Wellington 's tail gunner , seriously wounding him in the face . <unk> into the sea , he was picked up by rescue craft . Losing the sight in his left eye , he spent the next six months in recovery . He was shot down by Corporal Copley of No. 38 Squadron RAF . 
 However , he returned to active service , as Gruppe Adjutant of I. / ZG 26 . Still able to fly combat missions , his aircraft sported a pencil under his Adjutant ’ s chevron – bemoaning the combat pilot ’ s universal loathing of paperwork ! During the French campaign , on 23 May 1940 , Spitfires were encountered by Bf 110s and Bf 109s for the first time . The engagement resulted in the loss of two Bf 110s and two Bf 109s . However , Specht would claim three RAF Supermarine Spitfire fighters shot down . The British No. 92 Squadron RAF involved lost three Spitfires in the entire engagement . Squadron Leader Roger J Bushell became a prisoner of war while Paul H. Klipsch and Patrick Alexander George <unk> were killed in action . During the course of this battle , Specht and his rear gunner / radio operator were wounded , force land near Calais and Boulogne @-@ sur @-@ Mer with a damaged aircraft . Again he was badly injured and spent further time in hospital . 
 After recovering he took up staff duties for a year , until 16 September 1941 , when he was made Staffelkapitän ( Squadron leader ) of a newly formed night @-@ fighter training unit , 2 . / Nachtjagdschule 1 ( coming out of 2 . / Zerstörerschule 1 ) . Soon after , on 31 October , Hauptmann ( Captain ) Specht was promoted to Kommandeur of III . / <unk> 1 . Located at Ingolstadt @-@ Manching , Specht instructed pilots in conversion to night fighting . Paul <unk> , a future night fighter expert , was one of his students . Leading the Gruppe for exactly one year , this was the last time Specht flew a twin engine aircraft , whereupon he returned to combat duties . 
 Initially reassigned to 10 . / JG 1 based in the Ruhr , he shot down his first <unk> ( four @-@ engined bomber ) , his 7th victory , on 26 February 1943 . This was the beginning of a new war for Specht – the 8th USAAF was starting its bombing offensive on the Reich ’ s industrial complex . Soon afterward , on 27 March , he was appointed <unk> of the newly reformed 7 . / JG 1 , then in May 1943 he was promoted to Kommandeur of II / JG 11 . Jagdgeschwader 11 was a new fighter wing , created in April 1943 by dividing Jagdgeschwader 1 ( flying Fw 190s ) in half and filling it out into a full wing with new Gruppen flying Me 109G @-@ 6 ' gunboats ' , to increase the homeland protection . He was based back near his original airfields on the North Sea coast , his unit the first line of defense against the bomber streams and their fighter escorts . 
 Throughout 1943 , as the Luftwaffe took the fight to the bombers flying unescorted over the Reich , Specht scored regularly . Leading by example , he soon became one of the top <unk> aces shooting down 14 bombers out of his 18 victories that year . This included his 13th victory on 26 July , during Blitz Week , when bombers targeted the Blohm & Voss U Boat yards in Hamburg and the synthetic rubber factories of Continental AG and <unk> in Hanover . ; as well a pair on 17 August on the infamous Schweinfurt raid . He was awarded the Ehrenpokal ( Goblet of Honour ) on 23 August , and the German Cross in Gold on 25 November . Specht became increasingly critical of the relatively weak armament of the Bf 109 during this time . Towards the end of 1943 , with longer @-@ ranged fighter @-@ escorts accompanying the Allied bombers , tactics had to change : The single @-@ engined fighters would engage the fighter screen while a <unk> would take on the bombers . Coincidentally , for a while Specht ’ s II . / JG 11 was paired up with his old unit , I. / ZG 26 . 
 He continued his success into 1944 : On 11 February 1944 II . / JG 11 engaged escort fighters returning from a raid on Frankfurt with Specht downing 2nd Lieutenant Richard McDonald of the 354th Fighter Group , who crashed his P @-@ 51 Mustang " Plane Jane " near <unk> . Nine days later , ( the opening of the 8th USAAF 's " Big Week " ) Specht had to crash land on the <unk> Island as a result of technical problems with his Bf 109G . Despite that , he was back in the air the next day claiming a P @-@ 47 fighter , and a bomber and a fighter the day after , to take his tally to 30 . On 15 March II . / JG 11 lost six killed in action , two wounded , and eight aircraft lost , resulting in Specht declaring the unit non @-@ operational for six weeks to rest and replace losses . 
 On 8 April 1944 Specht was awarded the Ritterkreuz des Eisernen Kreuzes for his 30 victories on the Western Front . On 15 April after his commander , Hermann Graf was injured , he gave up his command of II . / JG 11 , and moved to the Geschwaderstab ( Wing Command flight ) as Kommodore @-@ in @-@ training , under Herbert Ihlefeld . Promoted to Major on 1 May , he was given full command of JG 11 on 15 May , replacing Ihlefeld who was himself transferred to command JG 1 . But little could be done as the Allied bombing offensive stepped up a gear . His units were decimated over the skies of Normandy in June and July . He himself was injured in July , suffering head injuries in yet another crash @-@ landing . Despite severe pain from his injuries Specht remained on combat duty . His wing was retired to the Rhineland to be rebuilt , but they were crushed again in the latter half of 1944 . The Allies were now sending overwhelming numbers of bombers to destroy the German industrial and military factories and now protected by the advent of the P @-@ 51 Mustang , providing fighter cover right into the heart of the Reich and back . 
 During Operation Market Garden , the Allied parachute landings in the Netherlands , JG 11 was credited with 22 aircraft downed on 22 September , with two credited to Specht . Four days later , Specht claimed two RAF Hawker Typhoons near Deventer . According to RAF records only three Typhoons were shot down on 26 September ; two to flak and one in aerial combat against Jagdgeschwader 53 Bf 109s near Apeldoorn . No fighters were recorded lost near Deventer . However , it may be the case that loss records were lost or not well kept , meaning Specht 's claims cannot be traced and may well be accurate . 
 = = = Operation Bodenplatte = = = 
 In December , Hitler ordered his final , desperate attack in the west - through the snow @-@ covered forests of the Ardennes . Poor weather kept the promised air support grounded , but early on the morning of New Year 's Day , long after it was tactically useful or relevant , the Luftwaffe launched Operation Bodenplatte ( ' <unk> ' ) - not against the devastating strategic bombers , but on the frontline fighter airbases . 
 Virtually all available fighter groups in the west were allocated to this mission , JG 11 was assigned the USAAF airfield at Asch ( Code Name Y – 29 ) and the RAF airfield at Ophoven north of Asch . The 366th Fighter Group ( 366th FG , Ninth Air Force ) and the 352nd Fighter Group ( 352 FG , Eighth Air Force ) were based at Asch . No. 41 , No. 130 , 350 and No. 610 Squadrons of the 2nd Tactical Wing were based at Ophoven . 
 For this mission Specht wore his full dress uniform with medals instead of his flight suit . JG 11 was based at Darmstadt @-@ <unk> , <unk> , and Gross @-@ <unk> . I. / JG 11 , III . / JG 11 ( Fw 190 A – 9 ) , and II . / JG 11 ( Bf 109G ) mustered sixty @-@ five aircraft for this mission . Specht flew Fw 190 A @-@ 9 ( Wk . Nr. <unk> ) " Black 4 " . Overall the operation was a major failure . With the large proportion of inexperienced , green pilots , flight coordination was extremely difficult and due to the extreme secrecy many pilots were shot down by their own FlaK antiaircraft , who were not pre @-@ warned of the operation . It also resulted in the loss of a number of irreplaceable combat leaders . 
 As regards JG 11 specifically , at 8 : 08 am the aircraft took off and assembled over Aschaffenburg with two Junkers Ju 188 ' Pathfinders ' to navigate . After assembling , Specht ordered all aircraft to fly at 400 feet ( 120 m ) to the target area , climbing to 1 @,@ 500 feet ( 460 m ) prior to commencing the attack . Some P @-@ 47 Thunderbolts of the 390th Fighter Squadron , 366th FG , were already airborne and Mustangs of the <unk> Fighter Squadron , 352nd FG , were on the runway . The formation was disrupted by flak , and several German aircraft were shot down . 
 The P @-@ 47 and P @-@ 51s took a heavy toll of JG 11 ; some 25 pilots were lost , including Specht , who was posted as Missing In Action , along with other senior officers of JG 11 . 
 = = = Death and subsequent confusion = = = 
 There was some confusion over the circumstance of Specht 's death . Lt. Melvin Paisley and his wingman Flight Officer Dave Johnson were flying 366th FG P @-@ 47s ; Johnson shot down two German fighters before his aircraft was heavily damaged from return fire . Bailing out , he landed in a field near Asch . A Bf 109 he had shot down had belly landed close by and Johnson rode a borrowed bicycle over to inspect it . The aircraft was intact but the pilot was dead . Johnson took the pilot 's identification card and gun and rode back to base . The identification card identified the pilot as an Oberstleutnant ( Lt Colonel ) ; however , the card actually belonged to Oberleutnant ( German : Oberleutnant ) August Engel of 8 Staffel . 
 Further research has revealed more detail . German records confirmed Specht flew a Fw 190 , not a Bf 109 , and that he was a Major at the time , confirming Johnson 's victim was most likely to have been Engel . Johnson 's claim form revealed he had claimed a Bf 109 , not an Fw 190 . The ID card of Johnson 's victim was passed on to a member of the ground crew who spoke German . This individual stated that the rank was given as Lieutenant Colonel . The incorrect identification was most likely a language error and misunderstanding of German ranks . This may have caused the belief that Johnson had killed Specht . Johnson died in October 1976 , and aviation historians were unable to secure his version of events . 
 Specht was officially listed as Missing In Action over Maastricht , but he has recently been confirmed dead . He crashed his plane after taking heavy fire . Specht was promoted posthumously to Oberstleutnant and nominated for the Eichenlaub ( Oak Leaves to the Knight 's Cross ) though this was never awarded in the bedlam of the final weeks of the war . Shot down six times in his career , he preferred to ride the plane to a landing rather than taking to his parachute . Specht was credited with 34 aerial victories , which included 15 <unk> , all achieved over the Western Front .

 The Sega Pico , also known as Kids Computer Pico ( <unk> ・ <unk> , <unk> <unk> Piko ) , is an educational video game console by Sega . Marketed as " edutainment " , the main focus of the Pico was educational video games for children between 3 and 7 years old . The Pico was released in 1993 in Japan and 1994 in North America and Europe , and later reached China . It was later succeeded by the Advanced Pico Beena , which was released in Japan in 2005 . Though the Pico was sold continuously in Japan through the release of the Beena , in North America and Europe the Pico was less successful and was discontinued in early 1998 , later being rereleased by Majesco . Releases for the Pico were focused on education for children and included titles supported by licensed franchised animated characters , including Disney and Sega 's own Sonic the Hedgehog series . Overall , Sega claims sales of 3 @.@ 4 million Pico consoles and 11 @.@ 2 million game cartridges , and over 350 @,@ 000 Beena consoles and 800 @,@ 000 cartridges . 
 = = Design and software = = 
 Powered by the same hardware used in the Sega Genesis , the physical shape of the Pico was designed to appear similar to a laptop . Included in the Pico are a stylus called the " Magic Pen " and a pad to draw on . Controlling the games for the system is accomplished either by using the Magic Pen like a mouse or by pressing the directional buttons on the console . The Pico does not include its own screen or RF output , and instead must be connected to a monitor through a VCR in order to be played . Touching the pen to the pad would either allow drawing or animate a character on the screen . 
 Cartridges for the system were referred to as " Storyware " , and take the form of picture books with a cartridge slot on the bottom . The Pico changes the television display and the set of tasks for the player to accomplish each time a page is turned . Sound , including voices and music , also accompanied every page . Games for the Pico focused on education , including on subjects such as music , counting , spelling , reading , matching , and coloring . Titles included licensed animated characters from various franchises , such as Disney 's The Lion King : Adventures at Pride Rock and A Year at Pooh Corner . Sega also released titles including their mascot , Sonic the Hedgehog , including Sonic Gameworld and Tails and the Music Maker .

 Released at a price of JP ¥ 13 @,@ 440 , the Pico was released in Japan in June 1993 . In North America , Sega unveiled the Pico at the 1994 American International Toy Fair , showcasing its drawing and display abilities . It was later released in North America in November 1994 , advertised before release at a price of approximately US $ 160 but eventually released at US $ 139 . " Storyware " cartridges sold for US $ 39 @.@ 99 to US $ 49 @.@ 99 . The Pico 's slogan was : " The computer that thinks it 's a toy . " After a lack of success , Sega discontinued the Pico in North America in early 1998 . Later , a remake of the Pico made by Majesco was released in North America in August 1999 at a price of US $ 49 @.@ 99 , with Storyware selling at $ 19 @.@ 99 . The Pico would later be released in China in 2002 , priced at CN ¥ 690 . 
 In 2000 , Sega claimed that the Pico had sold 2 @.@ 5 million units . As of April 2005 , Sega claims that 3 @.@ 4 million Pico consoles and 11 @.@ 2 million software cartridges had been sold worldwide . The Pico was recognized in 1995 by being listed on Dr. Toy 's 100 Best Products , as well as being listed in Child as one of the best computer games available . According to Joseph Szadkowski of The Washington Times , " Pico has enough power to be a serious learning aid that teaches counting , spelling , matching , problem solving , memory , logic , hand / eye coordination and important , basic computer skills . " Former Sega of America vice president of product development Joe Miller claims that he named his dog after the system because of his passion for the console . By contrast , Steven L. Kent claims that Sega of Japan CEO Hayao Nakayama watched the Pico " utterly fail " in North America . According to Warren <unk> of Children 's Software Revenue , the Pico failed in North America due to a lack of credibility in the product .

 The Advanced Pico Beena , also known simply as Beena or <unk> , is an educational console system targeted at young children sold by Sega Toys , released in 2005 in Japan . It is the successor of the Pico , and marketed around the " learn while playing " concept . According to Sega Toys , the focus of the Advanced Pico Beena is on learning in a new social environment , and is listed as their upper @-@ end product . Topics listed as being educational focuses for the Beena include intellectual , moral , physical , dietary and safety education . The name of the console was chosen to sound like the first syllables of " Be Natural " . 
 Compared to the Pico , the Beena adds several functions . Beena can be played without a television , and supports multiplayer by a separately sold additional Magic Pen . The console also supports data saving . Play time can be limited by settings in the system . Some games for the Beena also offer adaptive difficulty , which becomes more difficult to play based on the skill level of the player . The Beena Lite , a cheaper version of the console , was released on July 17 , 2008 . At the time of its release , Sega estimated that 350 @,@ 000 Beena consoles had been sold , and 800 @,@ 000 game cartridges .

 The nursehound ( Scyliorhinus stellaris ) , also known as the large @-@ spotted dogfish , greater spotted dogfish , or bull huss , is a species of catshark , belonging to the family Scyliorhinidae , found in the northeastern Atlantic Ocean . It is generally found among rocks or algae at a depth of 20 – 60 m ( 66 – 197 ft ) . Growing up to 1 @.@ 6 m ( 5 @.@ 2 ft ) long , the nursehound has a robust body with a broad , rounded head and two dorsal fins placed far back . It shares its range with the more common and closely related small @-@ spotted catshark ( S. <unk> ) , which it resembles in appearance but can be distinguished from , in having larger spots and nasal skin flaps that do not extend to the mouth . 
 Nursehounds have nocturnal habits and generally hide inside small holes during the day , often associating with other members of its species . A benthic predator , it feeds on a range of bony fishes , smaller sharks , crustaceans , and cephalopods . Like other catsharks , the nursehound is oviparous in reproduction . Females deposit large , thick @-@ walled egg cases , two at a time , from March to October , securing them to bunches of seaweed . The eggs take 7 – 12 months to hatch . Nursehounds are marketed as food in several European countries under various names , including " flake " , " catfish " , " rock eel " , and " rock salmon " . It was once also valued for its rough skin ( called " <unk> " ) , which was used as an abrasive . The International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) has assessed the nursehound as Near Threatened , as its population in the Mediterranean Sea seems to have declined substantially from overfishing . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 The first scientific description of the nursehound was published by Carl Linnaeus , in the 1758 tenth edition of Systema Naturae . He gave it the name Squalus stellaris , the specific epithet stellaris being Latin for " starry " . No type specimen was designated . In 1973 , Stewart Springer moved this species to the genus Scyliorhinus . The common name " nursehound " came from an old belief by English fishermen that this shark attends to its smaller relatives , while the name " huss " may have come from a distortion of the word " nurse " over time . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 The nursehound is found in the northeastern Atlantic from southern Norway and Sweden to Senegal , including off the British Isles , throughout the Mediterranean Sea , and the Canary Islands . It may occur as far south as the mouth of the Congo River , though these West African records may represent misidentifications of the West African catshark ( S. <unk> ) . Its range seems to be rather patchy , particularly around offshore islands , where there are small local populations with limited exchange between them . The nursehound can be found from the intertidal zone to a depth of 400 m ( 1 @,@ 300 ft ) , though it is most common between 20 m ( 66 ft ) and 60 – 125 m ( 197 – 410 ft ) . This bottom @-@ dwelling species prefers quiet water over rough or rocky terrain , including sites with algal cover . In the Mediterranean , it favors algae @-@ covered coral . 
 = = Description = = 
 The nursehound attains a length of 1 @.@ 6 m ( 5 @.@ 2 ft ) , though most measure less than 1 @.@ 3 m ( 4 @.@ 3 ft ) . This shark has a broad , rounded head and a stout body that tapers towards the tail . The eyes are oval in shape , with a thick fold of skin on the lower rim but no nictitating membrane . Unlike in the small @-@ spotted catshark , the large flaps of skin beside the nares do not reach the mouth . In the upper jaw , there are 22 – 27 tooth rows on either side and 0 – 2 teeth at the symphysis ( center ) ; in the lower jaw , there are 18 – 21 tooth rows on either side and 2 – 4 teeth at the symphysis . The teeth are Y @-@ shaped and smooth @-@ edged ; the anterior teeth have a single central cusp , while the posterior teeth have an additional pair of lateral cusplets . Towards the rear of the jaws , the teeth become progressively smaller and more angled , with proportionately larger lateral cusplets . The five pairs of gill slits are small , with the last two over the pectoral fin bases . 
 The two dorsal fins are placed far back on the body ; the first is larger than the second and originates over the bases of the pelvic fins . The pectoral fins are large . In males , the inner margins of the pelvic fins are merged into an " apron " over the claspers . The caudal fin is broad and nearly horizontal , with an indistinct lower lobe . The skin is very rough , due to a covering of large , upright dermal denticles . The nursehound has small black dots covering its back and sides , interspersed with brown spots of varying shapes larger than the pupil , on a grayish or brownish background . The pattern is highly variable across individuals and ages ; there may also be white spots , or the brown spots may be expanded so that almost the whole body is dark , or a series of faint " saddles " may be present . The underside is plain white . 
 = = Biology and ecology = = 
 Primarily nocturnal , <unk> spend the day inside small holes in rocks and swim into deeper water at night to hunt . Sometimes two sharks will squeeze into the same hole , and several individuals will seek out refuges within the same local area . In one tracking study , a single immature nursehound was observed to use five different refuges in succession over a period of 168 days , consistently returning to each one over a number of days before moving on . Nursehounds may occupy refuges to hide from predators , avoid harassment by mature conspecifics , and / or to facilitate thermoregulation . In captivity , these sharks are gregarious and tend to rest in groups , though the individuals comprising any particular group changes frequently . This species is less common than the small @-@ spotted catshark . 
 The nursehound feeds on a variety of benthic organisms , including bony fishes such mackerel , deepwater cardinalfishes , <unk> , gurnards , flatfishes , and herring , and smaller sharks such as the small @-@ spotted catshark . It also consumes crustaceans , in particular crabs but also hermit crabs and large shrimp , and cephalopods . Given the opportunity , this shark will scavenge . Adults consume relatively more bony fish and cephalopods , and fewer crustaceans , than juveniles . Known parasites of this species include the monogeneans <unk> <unk> and <unk> major , the tapeworm Acanthobothrium coronatum , the trypanosome Trypanosoma <unk> , the isopod <unk> <unk> , and the copepod <unk> <unk> . The netted dog whelk ( <unk> reticulatus ) preys on the nursehound 's eggs by piercing the case and extracting the yolk . 
 = = = Life history = = = 
 Like other members of its family , the nursehound is oviparous . Known breeding grounds include the River Fal estuary and Wembury Bay in England , and a number of coastal sites around the Italian Peninsula , in particular the Santa Croce Bank in the Gulf of Naples . Adults move into shallow water in the spring or early summer , and mate only at night . The eggs are deposited in the shallows from March to October . Although a single female produces 77 – 109 oocytes per year , not all of these are ovulated and estimates of the actual number of eggs laid range from 9 to 41 . The eggs mature and are released two at a time , one from each oviduct . Each egg is enclosed in a thick , dark brown case measuring 10 – 13 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 – 5 @.@ 1 in ) long and 3 @.@ 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 4 in ) wide . There are tendrils at the four corners , that allow the female to secure the egg cases to bunches of seaweed ( usually <unk> spp. or <unk> <unk> ) . 
 Eggs in the North Sea and the Atlantic take 10 – 12 months to hatch , while those from the southern Mediterranean take 7 months to hatch . The length at hatching is 16 cm ( 6 @.@ 3 in ) off Britain , and 10 – 12 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 – 4 @.@ 7 in ) off France . Newly hatched sharks grow at a rate of 0 @.@ 45 – 0 @.@ 56 mm ( 0 @.@ 018 – 0 @.@ 022 in ) per day , and have prominent saddle markings . Sexual maturity is attained at a length of 77 – 79 cm ( 30 – 31 in ) , which corresponds to an age of four years if hatchling growth rates remain constant . This species has a lifespan of at least 19 years . 
 = = Human interactions = = 
 Nursehounds are generally harmless to humans . However , 19th @-@ century British naturalist Jonathan Couch noted that " although not so formidable with its teeth as many other sharks , this fish is well able to defend itself from an enemy . When seized it throws its body round the arm that holds it , and by a contractile and reversed action of its body grates over the surface of its enemy with the rugged spines of its skin , like a rasp . There are few animals that can bear so severe an infliction , by which their surface is torn with lacerated wounds . " This shark is displayed by many public aquariums and has been bred in captivity . 
 The rough skin ( called " <unk> " ) of the nursehound was once used to polish wood and alabaster , to smooth arrows and barrels , and to raise the hairs of beaver hats as a replacement for pumice . <unk> was so valued that a pound of it was worth a hundredweight of sandpaper . The liver was also used as a source of oil , and the carcasses cut up and used to bait crab traps . The meat of this species is marketed fresh or dried and salted , though it is considered " coarse " in some quarters . In the United Kingdom , it is one of the species sold under the names " flake " , " catfish " , " huss " " rock eel " , or " rock salmon " . In France , it is sold as grande <unk> or <unk> , as after being skinned and beheaded it resembles salmon . This species is also sometimes processed into fishmeal , or its fins dried and exported to the Asian market . In European waters , commercial production of this species is led by France , followed by the UK and Portugal ; it is caught using bottom trawls , gillnets , bottom set longlines , handlines and fixed bottom nets . In 2004 , a total catch of 208 tons was reported from the northeastern Atlantic . 
 The impact of fishing activities on the nursehound is difficult to assess as species @-@ specific data is generally lacking . This species is more susceptible to overfishing than the small @-@ spotted catshark because of its larger size and fragmented distribution , which limits the recovery potential of depleted local stocks . There is evidence that its numbers have declined significantly in the Gulf of Lion , off Albania , and around the Balearic Islands . In the upper Tyrrhenian Sea , its numbers have fallen by over 99 % since the 1970s . These declines have led the International Union for Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) to list the nursehound under Near Threatened . 
 = Typhoon Soudelor ( 2003 ) = 
 Typhoon Soudelor , known in the Philippines as Typhoon Egay , was a powerful typhoon that underwent rapid deepening east of Taiwan in the 2003 Pacific typhoon season . It was the sixth named storm by the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) of the season , as well as the third typhoon . It formed on June 12 from a disturbance in the monsoon trough , located east of the Philippines . The system moved generally to the northwest after its genesis , gradually intensifying into a tropical storm . While offshore the Philippines , Soudelor dropped heavy rainfall that caused flooding and left thousands homeless . The storm caused $ 2 @.@ 46 million in damage , and 12 deaths . 
 After affecting the Philippines , Soudelor moved into an area of low wind shear and with favorable outflow . It became a typhoon on June 17 , and quickly developed an eye while rapidly intensifying . The storm struck the Japanese island of Iriomote @-@ jima , where wind gusts reached 204 km / h ( 127 mph ) . It also affected Taiwan , where floods covered highways and caused mudslides . Early on June 18 , Soudelor reached peak 10 ‑ minute sustained winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) . Subsequently , an increase in shear and the passage of a trough weakened the typhoon and caused it to turn to the northeast . Soudelor weakened to a tropical storm on June 19 , and subsequently it passed between Japan and South Korea . It became an extratropical cyclone that day , dissipating on June 24 . In Japan , the storm caused widespread power outages , although damage was minimal , and there were 21 injuries . In South Korea , there was $ 12 @.@ 1 million in damage and two deaths . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of Soudelor were from a tropical disturbance that persisted a short distance northwest of Pohnpei on June 7 . By two days later , it had a large area of convection , and it moved generally westward . Late on June 9 , the Joint Typhoon Warning Center ( JTWC ) issued a tropical cyclone formation alert ( TCFA ) , although the system initially failed to develop due to wind shear in the region . The thunderstorms decreased over the increasingly exposed circulation . On June 11 , the shear decreased , and convection became better organized . The JTWC initiated warnings on Tropical Depression 07W late that day , and at 0000 UTC on June 12 , the Japan Meteorological Agency ( JMA ) also remarked that a tropical depression had formed to the northeast of Palau . 
 After forming , the depression tracked generally westward due to a subtropical ridge to the north . Around that time , it was still located within the monsoon trough , and it interacted with another circulation to its east @-@ southeast , causing a motion to the west @-@ northwest . As it moved away from the other circulation , the depression was able to intensify , and the wind shear decreased . On June 13 the JMA upgraded the depression to Tropical Storm Soudelor to the east of Samar Island in the Philippines . That day , the Philippine Atmospheric , Geophysical and Astronomical Services Administration PAGASA initiated advisories and gave it the local name " Egay " . Upon becoming a tropical storm , Soudelor developed rainbands to the north and south , although it could not intensify significantly due to a tropical upper tropospheric trough to the east . A mid @-@ latitude trough to the north weakened the ridge , which allowed Soudelor to turn more to the northwest off the northeast coast of the Philippines . The circulation became exposed from the deepest convection , and around that time the storm was located about 160 km ( 100 mi ) east of Samar Island . Thunderstorms gradually increased , and the outflow improved . Late on June 16 , the JTWC upgraded Soudelor to a typhoon , and the next day the JMA followed suit when the storm was located southeast of Taiwan . 
 Around the time that Soudelor became a typhoon , it began moving toward the north , influenced by an approaching trough , and it passed about 95 km ( 60 mi ) northeast of Luzon . A ragged eye developed early on June 17 , which quickly became better organized . With its outflow enhanced by the approaching trough , Soudelor rapidly intensified to the east of Taiwan . The typhoon struck the Japanese island of Iriomote @-@ jima at around 2030 UTC on June 17 . At 0600 UTC on June 18 , the JTWC estimated peak 1 ‑ minute winds of 215 km / h ( 135 mph ) . At the same time , JMA estimated peak 10 ‑ minute winds of 150 km / h ( 90 mph ) when it was located west of Okinawa . While at its maximum strength , Soudelor had a circular eye 33 km ( 21 mi ) in diameter . It turned to the north @-@ northeast , maintaining its peak winds for about 12 hours before increased shear from the westerlies caused weakening . The eye quickly dissipated , and the system began transitioning into an extratropical cyclone . Early on June 19 , the JMA downgraded Soudelor below typhoon status , and the storm later crossed between Japan and South Korea into the Sea of Japan . At 1500 UTC that day , the JMA declared the storm as extratropical while it was near the Oki Islands ; the JTWC followed suit three hours later . The extratropical remnants of Soudelor continued to the northeast , crossing northern Japan on June 20 . The storm slowed and turned to the east , dissipating on June 24 . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 By June 16 , PAGASA raised storm signal number 3 for Batanes and the provinces of Cagayan and Isabela ; storm signal number 2 for all or portions of nine provinces and for Polillo Island ; and storm signal number 1 was raised for portions of four provinces . The signals refer to the potential for winds , from lowest to highest representing weakest to strongest winds ; number 3 refers to the potential for winds of 100 to 185 km / h ( 62 to 115 mph ) within 18 hours . 
 On June 16 , the Central Weather Bureau issued sea and land warnings in Taiwan as Soudelor was anticipated to produce torrential rains , gale @-@ force winds , and rough seas . All fishermen in the area were urged to return to port before the onset of the typhoon . As the typhoon tracked near Taiwan , the Japan Meteorological Agency began advising residents in Okinawa to closely monitor the storm . One of the major airlines in Japan , All Nippon Airways , cancelled 66 domestic flights the same day , stranding an estimated 6 @,@ 000 people . During the storm , 257 domestic flights were canceled , and train and ferry service was canceled . In Nagasaki Prefecture , 732 schools were closed during the storm . Hundreds of people voluntarily evacuated in Japan . 
 On June 17 , the Korean Meteorological Agency issued rain warnings for Jeju Island and coastal areas of South Korea . They also urged residents to take all precautions for the storm . The Korea Airports Corporation reported that 111 flights to southern areas of the country were cancelled due to the typhoon .

 While Soudelor was moving to the northwest off the east coast of the Philippines , it dropped heavy rainfall , including 300 mm ( 12 in ) in 24 hours in <unk> , Northern Samar . Rainfall in six hours reached 118 mm ( 4 @.@ 6 in ) at <unk> Airport . The rains caused flooding throughout the Philippines , which left thousands of people homeless . Throughout the country , the storm damaged 157 houses and destroyed 94 . Soudelor also left crop damage . An estimated 45 @,@ 400 people were affected by Soudelor . Overall damage was estimated at ₱ 131 million ( 2003 Philippine pesos , $ 2 @.@ 46 million 2003 USD ) . There were 12 deaths , with two missing , as well as two people injured . 
 In Taiwan , Soudelor dropped heavy rainfall that resulted in flooding and landslides . One of the mudslides covered a 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) section of the <unk> Highway between <unk> and <unk> . Road crews were quickly dispatched to the area but had to suspend cleanup efforts due to continuing impacts from Soudelor . Dozens of tour buses carrying tourists who were being evacuated from the mountains were blocked several times by mudslides covering roads . The <unk> Airport in Taipei was shut down during the morning of June 19 due to unsettled weather produced by the typhoon . The Feitsui Dam increased by 2 @.@ 5 m ( 8 @.@ 2 ft ) due to the storm 's rainfall , raising it to near peak capacity . 
 For eight hours , the Japanese island of Iriomote @-@ jima reported gale @-@ force winds , except for during the eye passage of Soudelor . The island reported sustained winds of 108 km / h ( 67 mph ) , with gusts to 204 km / h ( 127 mph ) . On Ishigaki Island , the storm caused ¥ 77 @.@ 9 million ( 2003 JPY , $ 655 @,@ 000 2003 USD ) in agriculture damage , mostly from high waves . Soudelor dropped heavy rainfall throughout Japan , peaking at 497 mm ( 19 @.@ 6 in ) in Kagoshima Prefecture ; most of the precipitation fell in about 24 hours . A North Korean cargo ship was stranded off the northwest coast of Japan after being refused entry into the Japanese port of Toyama . During the storm , about 10 @,@ 000 houses lost power , including 3 @,@ 400 houses in Okinawa Prefecture . Damage was minor , with only 26 damaged houses , varying from blown off roof tiles to shattered windows . Soudelor injured 21 people in the country , mostly due to falling objects . There were at least 22 landslides nationwide . Four bridges along the Yoshino River were flooded during the storm . 
 In South Korea , Soudelor dropped about 500 mm ( 20 in ) of rainfall at <unk> in Jeju Province in South Korea . The storm also caused 4 m ( 13 ft ) seas . Typhoon Soudelor killed two people in South Korea and caused $ 12 @.@ 1 million in damages . 
 = Novomessor ensifer = 
 Novomessor ensifer is a species of ant endemic to Mexico . A member of the genus Novomessor in the subfamily Myrmicinae , it was first described by Swiss entomologist Auguste Forel in 1899 . N. ensifer was originally a part of the genus Aphaenogaster until a recent phylogenetic study concluded that Novomessor was genetically distinct and should be separated . The ant is a medium @-@ sized species , measuring 5 @.@ 5 to 10 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 2 to 0 @.@ 4 in ) . The ant is ferruginous @-@ colored in some certain parts of the body , and small workers ( <unk> ) in incipient colonies are noticeably different in color and body structure . 
 N. ensifer is active throughout the day , where they forage on the ground and sometimes on low herbs . Colonies are found under stones and other objects in tropical dry forests and pine @-@ oak forests . These ants are solitary foragers and predominately feed on insects such as wasps and months . The only known predator of N. ensifer is the giant horned lizard ( Phrynosoma asio ) . While nothing is known about its reproduction , nuptial flight may take place during spring or summer , where queens establish their nests under stones and other objects .

 Novomessor ensifer was originally described as Aphaenogaster ensifera in 1899 by Swiss entomologist Auguste Forel , who provided the first <unk> of N. ensifer in his third volume of <unk> <unk> @-@ Americana . Among the genus Aphaenogaster , Italian entomologist Carlo Emery placed N. ensifer in the subgenus <unk> in 1915 , although this is now a synonym . In 1934 , the taxon Novomessor manni was described as a new species of Novomessor based on workers collected by William M. Mann at Colima , Mexico . However , a study showed that N. manni was a synonym of N. ensifer . Brown comments that N. manni was described as a new species because of the supposed distinct features between two type specimens of N. ensifer , but Brown noticed no morphological differences . The exact type locality for N. manni is unknown , but entomologist Paul <unk> speculates that the ant is restricted to arid scrub forests around the Pacific Slope in Mexico . This speculation is consistent with the preferred habitat of N. ensifer . 
 Novomessor was synonymized in 1974 , although evidence to retain it as a valid genus emerged when scientists discovered an exocrine gastral glandular system in two Novomessor species and none in Aphaenogaster . However , N. ensifer does not have this glandular system . English myrmecologist Barry Bolton argues that basing the genus on such feature cannot justify the separation of Novomessor and Aphaenogaster . In 2015 , a phylogenetic study concluded that Novomessor was genetically distinct from Aphaenogaster , and the genus was revived from synonymy to include N. ensifer , N. albisetosus and N. <unk> as members of it .

 N. ensifer is a medium @-@ sized species , measuring 5 @.@ 5 to 10 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 2 to 0 @.@ 4 in ) . Excluding the mandibles , the head is 1 @.@ 93 – 2 @.@ 53 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 076 – 0 @.@ 100 in ) long and 1 @.@ 25 – 1 @.@ 69 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 049 – 0 @.@ 067 in ) wide . The scapes of the antennae surpass the occipital margin , and the second segment of the funiculus is longer than the first . The third and fourth segments are the same length as each other , although they are longer than the second . Between the fifth and second last segments , they are much shorter except for the last one . The head is twice as long than broad , and it is widest behind the eyes . The larvae measure 8 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 3 in ) in length and appear similar to that of N. albisetosus . The larvae can be distinguished by the abundance of hair with long stouts found on the body . The apical teeth of the mandibles are long and straight , whereas the medial teeth are much smaller . 
 The posterior to the eyes are convex , where it converges towards the occiput ( the back of the head ) and forms a collar seen in several Aphaenogaster species . The ants have large , triangular mandibles with three apical teeth and a flat clypeus . The eyes are large with 400 facets , but workers from small incipient colonies only have 200 facets . Workers from incipient also differ from workers living in mature colonies , notably in size , body shape and coloration . The average length is 5 @.@ 56 – 6 @.@ 5 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 219 – 0 @.@ 256 in ) ; the head is 1 @.@ 52 – 1 @.@ 69 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 060 – 0 @.@ 067 in ) long and 0 @.@ 98 – 1 @.@ 12 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 039 – 0 @.@ 044 in ) wide . The <unk> spines ( spines found on the first abdominal segment that protect the pedicel ) are much shorter . Hair is also less noticeable on the workers . 
 The ant has pubescence ( soft short hair ) abundant throughout some certain parts of the body , including the funiculi and tarsi . It is more sparse on the coxae , genae ( an area on both sides of the head below the eyes ) , gaster and gula ( the reduced sternite of the first segment of the thorax ) . Hairs on the scapes point downwards . Erect and suberect hair are seen all over the body in sparse numbers , although this varies . These hairs are not as abundant in comparison to other Novomessor species . The head and thorax are both ferruginous @-@ colored , and the <unk> spines , legs and node are yellowish red . The antennal scapes are reddish brown and the abdomen is <unk> brown . The hair exhibits a gold @-@ like color . The suture is absent from the thorax , and the mesonotum is wider than the epinotum . The front portion of the mesonotum is narrow whereas the back is rectangular . The node is evenly round and oval shaped , the postpetiole is narrow at the front and the dorsum is feebly convex . The gaster is large and oval shaped . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 N. ensifer is endemic to Mexico and can be found in tropical dry forests at altitudes of between 115 and 1 @,@ 700 ft ( 35 and 518 m ) above sea level . In some cases , colonies have been found 5 @,@ 000 ft ( 1 @,@ 500 m ) below the Pacific Slope . The ant is found throughout several Mexican states within the east , including Guerrero and Michoacán from the south , and Colima and Jalisco from the north . Nests are commonly found in basins and mountains along the Pacific Slope in pine @-@ oak forests . Scrub @-@ thorn forests are also abundant , consisting of trees and shrubs that are 15 and 25 ft ( 4 @.@ 6 and 7 @.@ 6 m ) tall , but other areas may contain low herbs and grasses . Plants and trees such as thorn trees ( Acacia ) , <unk> plants ( <unk> <unk> ) and Casearia corymbosa have been identified in these habitats . Other identified plants and trees include Indian mallows ( <unk> ) , spurred <unk> ( <unk> cristata ) , <unk> erectum , <unk> ( Commelina ) , cigar plants ( <unk> ) , hairy <unk> ( Digitaria <unk> ) , crane grass ( <unk> unisetus ) , Mimosa , Mexican <unk> ( Panicum <unk> ) , Senna uniflora and Setaria <unk> . These habitats usually have a wet season in summer and autumn and a dry season in spring . 
 N. ensifer is a <unk> species that can thrive in dry climates . In Colima , colonies are frequent among the basins , but rarely are they found in the mountainous regions . N. ensifer ants prefer to nest in the sand and under large stones , as certain areas in Manzanillo had no stones buried in the soil and no colonies were found alongside hills with plain soil . Most colonies are found under stones with no noticeable craters surrounding the nest entrance , although one colony was found under an Acacia plant . These nest holes are usually 1 in ( 2 @.@ 5 cm ) in diameter . A single path connects the entrance to the main nest site , followed by a passage that descends straight into the dirt several inches deep . This passage widens under a stone which forms a gallery for the larvae and pupae . Wherever stones are formed , passageways may descend further into the ground and form more chambers . Although it is unknown how deep these passages go , excavated nests are as deep as 15 in ( 38 cm ) .

 Unlike other Novomessor species , workers forage early in the morning and late afternoon , whereas N. <unk> and N. albisetosus forage during the afternoon and evening . However , it is unknown whether or not these ants are active during the night . Foragers first emerge from their nests at 9 A.M. and return by 5 P.M. They are rarely seen during the middle of the day when temperatures reach 95 – 100 ° F ( 35 – 38 ° C ) , although the ground temperature is considerably higher . Workers are commonly seen foraging between 9 and 11 A.M. and 3 to 5 P.M. Most workers forage on the ground , but sometimes they can be seen walking on low herbage without feeding on the plants or collecting any seeds . Excavated nests showed no evidence that these ants collect seeds , and no workers were seen collecting them or carrying them back to the nest . N. ensifer ants are solitary foragers that work 25 ft ( 7 m ) away from their home nest . N. ensifer predominately feeds on insects they prey on , consuming dead insects such as ichneumon wasps , <unk> wasps and small moths . When a worker discovers a dead insect , it will start to pull and carry it back to the nest immediately , and other nestmates will join once they detect it . Workers do not cooperate with each other and pull the insect from all directions , accidentally tearing it apart . However , the workers will eventually have a piece of the insect left and return it to the nest . The only known predator of N. ensifer is the giant horned lizard ( Phrynosoma asio ) . Mites and <unk> arthropods are known to dwell inside nests , but their function or purpose within a colony is unknown . 
 Nothing is known about its reproduction or nuptial flight . Collectors note that no alates or pupae resembling alate forms were found in excavated colonies between August and February , and the larvae collected were not large enough to be reproductive ants . However , it is possible that nuptial flight takes place in spring or summer , and like N. albisetosus and <unk> , alates most likely start to occur by June . After nuptial flight , queens search for a suitable colony by building a chamber under objects such as stones and exposed roots of woody plants . This theory stated by entomologist Paul <unk> is supported by the fact that these ants depend on stones buried in the soil for nest construction . The larvae and pupae are unsorted in the upper chambers of the nest that are joined together by hooked hairs on the side of the larvae . This arrangement most likely helps workers move the brood efficiently and keep them together in a group . <unk> colonies may only have 30 workers and brood in all life stages . Unlike the larvae and pupae , the eggs and queen are not found in the uppermost galleries , but rather they are found in the deepest chambers of the nest . In large nests , small workers resembling the first generation of brood are either rare or absent .

 Songs in the Key of X : Music from and Inspired by The X @-@ Files is a 1996 compilation album released in association with the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . The album contained a mixture of songs that were either featured in the series , or shared thematic elements with it . Songs in the Key of X peaked at No. 47 on the Billboard 200 album sales chart after its release . 
 The album has received positive reviews from critics , with one review describing it as " easily the most ambitious record ever assembled for a TV soundtrack " . The song " Hands of Death ( Burn Baby Burn ) " received a nomination for the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1997 , losing to Rage Against the Machine . The album also features two songs hidden in the pregap before the start of the first track , both recorded by Nick Cave . 
 = = Production = = 
 When plans for the album were initially proposed , executives at both Fox Broadcasting Company — the network responsible for the series — and Warner Bros. Records began compiling a list of possible inclusions , most of which were eventually rejected . Artists such as Tom Petty , Bruce Springsteen and Seal were approached to possibly contribute material . Although all three were admitted fans of the series , none were able to get involved in the project — Petty was unable to commit due to a tour , Springsteen was contractually tied to Sony Music Entertainment , while Seal was " snowboarding in South America or somewhere " . 
 Elvis Costello and Brian Eno 's track , " My Dark Life " , came about as a result of album producer David Was asking Costello to provide a song that would sound like " ' you went into the studio with Brian Eno " — the two musicians had recently met at a film screening at Paul McCartney 's home , and reconvened to record the song the following week . R.E.M. and author William S. Burroughs collaborated on a new version of " Star Me Kitten " , a song that had originally appeared on the band 's 1992 album Automatic for the People . Rob Zombie has described his collaboration with Alice Cooper on the song " Hands of Death ( Burn Baby Burn ) " as one of the " great moments where you really feel like you 've made your dreams come true " . Zombie and Cooper were nominated for the Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance in 1997 for the song , losing out to Rage Against the Machine 's " Tire Me " . 
 Several of the songs on the album were used in episodes of the series . Soul Coughing 's " Unmarked Helicopters " appeared in the fourth season episode " Max " , while Nick Cave 's " Red Right Hand " was heard during the second season episode " Ascension " . Three of the artists featured on the album would also go on to contribute songs to The X @-@ Files : The Album , the soundtrack to the series ' 1998 feature film adaptation — Foo Fighters ' " Walking After You " , Soul Coughing 's " 16 Horses " and Filter 's " One " . 
 = = Track listing = = 
 Producers used the Compact Disc 's pregap , so a listener would have to actually manually rewind the first track a full nine minutes to hear two additional hidden tracks , " Time Jesum <unk> Et Non <unk> " and a cover of The X @-@ Files theme song , both performed by Nick Cave and Dirty Three . This is hinted at in the album 's liner booklet , which notes " Nick Cave and the Dirty Three would like you to know that " 0 " is also a number " . The use of these hidden tracks has been described as " just the sort of surprise one might have suspected from a show that deals in unexplainable mysteries " . Not all CD or DVD players will allow the album to be " rewound " back to these tracks as this violates Red Book standards .

 Songs in the Key of X was released on March 19 , 1996 . It would eventually reach a peak chart position of 47 in the Billboard 200 album chart on April 13 that same year , spending a total of ten weeks in the chart . The album also spent five weeks in the Swedish Sverigetopplistan charts , peaking at number 42 , and six weeks in the Finland 's Official List chart , reaching a peak at number 24 . 
 Reviews for Songs in the Key of X were generally positive . Upon the album 's release , Entertainment Weekly 's David Browne rated it a B , calling it " easily the most ambitious record ever assembled for a TV soundtrack " . Browne felt that the contributions to the album by Sheryl Crow and William S. Burroughs were amongst its highlights , though felt that the compilation was " dragged down by ponderous contributions " from Nick Cave and Elvis Costello . AllMusic 's Steven McDonald was mostly positive towards the album , rating it three stars out of five and stating that " while not perfect , the album makes a nice alternative compilation " , noting that it shares the television series ' " blue @-@ light glow of twisted mystery " . McDonald felt that the Foo Fighters cover of Gary Numan 's " Down in the Park " and Elvis Costello 's " My Dark Life " , along with Mark Snow 's theme for the series , were the highlights of the compilation . Sandy Masuo , writing for the Los Angeles Times , rated the album three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half stars out of four , finding that the compilation 's " unsettling ambience " suited the " deliciously creepy " atmosphere of the series . Masuo felt that the collaborations between R.E.M. and William S. Burroughs , and Elvis Costello and Brian Eno , ultimately turned out to be " more interesting in theory than in practice " ; although adding that " Down in the Park " was the best track present on the compilation , with the contributions of Rob Zombie , Alice Cooper and P.M. Dawn also noted as highlights . 
 A review for the album in The Independent noted that none of the songs " can really hold a candle to Cave 's " Red Right Hand " in capturing the show 's sense of fatalistic futility " , adding that there seemed to be " a shared soul thing " between Cave and Carter . Ted Cox , writing for the Daily Herald , described the album as " a who 's who of modern rock " . Cox rated the album three stars out of five , noting that " most of the material hits the fair @-@ to @-@ middling quality level of a neglected album cut or a good B @-@ side " ; adding , however , that the album 's overall " atmosphere of paranoia and alienation " helped to tie it together . Writing for The Buffalo News , Anthony Violanti rated the album four stars out of five , calling it " a strange , delightful trip " . Violanti felt that " Star Me Kitten " was the album 's best song , and that Danzig 's " Deep " was its " weakest cut " . Writing for the Los Angeles Daily News , Fred Shuster felt that compared to other television tie @-@ ins that " aren 't worth the aluminum they 're recorded on " , Songs in the Key of X " is a rare exception because of the unusual quality and rarity of the tracks " . Shuster rated the album three stars out of five , describing it as " more imaginative than the show that inspired it " . 
 = Netherlands in the Eurovision Song Contest 2014 = 
 The Netherlands participated in the Eurovision Song Contest 2014 with the song " Calm After the Storm " , written by Ilse DeLange , JB Meijers , Rob Crosby , Matthew Crosby and Jake Etheridge . The song was performed by The Common Linnets , a duo consisting of DeLange and Waylon , two well @-@ known and popular Dutch artists , and formed by DeLange as a platform for Dutch artists to create country , Americana , and bluegrass music . In November 2013 the Dutch broadcaster AVROTROS announced that they had internally selected The Common Linnets to represent the Netherlands at the 2014 contest in Copenhagen , Denmark , with their song first presented to the public in March 2014 . 
 In the weeks leading up to the contest , the Netherlands was considered by the bookmakers to be one of the countries most likely to qualify for the final . In the first of two Eurovision semi @-@ finals " Calm After the Storm " came first of the sixteen participating countries , securing its place among the twenty @-@ five other countries in the final . In the Netherlands fifty @-@ fifth Eurovision appearance on 10 May , " Calm After the Storm " finished in second place , receiving 238 points and full marks from eight countries . This was the Netherlands best finish in the contest since 1975 . 
 After the show , the song went on to chart in several European countries , reaching number one in Belgium , Iceland and the Netherlands , as well as reaching the top ten in several other countries . The group 's self @-@ titled début album , released in May 2014 , was also a success in the Netherlands and in other countries . The success of The Common Linnets in the contest was met with wide praise , with many commenting that their triumph was a boost to the musicality and credibility of the contest . 
 = = Background = = 
 Prior to the 2014 contest , the Netherlands had participated in the Eurovision Song Contest fifty @-@ four times since its début as one of seven countries to take part in the inaugural contest . Since then , the country has won the contest four times : in the 1957 contest with the song " Net als <unk> " performed by Corry <unk> ; in the 1959 contest with the song " ' n <unk> " performed by Teddy Scholten ; in the 1969 contest as one of four countries to tie for first place with " De troubadour " performed by Lenny <unk> ; and in the 1975 contest with " Ding @-@ a @-@ Dong " performed by the group Teach @-@ In . Following the introduction of semi @-@ finals for the 2004 contest , the Netherlands had been featured in only two finals . The Netherlands ' least successful result has been last place , which they have achieved on five occasions , most recently in the 2011 contest . The Netherlands has also received nul points on two occasions ; in the 1962 and 1963 contests . 
 In 2014 The Dutch broadcaster AVROTROS organised the selection process for the Netherlands ' Eurovision entrant and broadcast the event nationally . AVROTROS had been formed in January 2014 when the Dutch government merged former public broadcasters <unk> , who had organised the Dutch entry between 2010 and 2013 , and AVRO . Various methods have been used to select the Dutch entry in the past , such as the Nationaal <unk> , a live televised national final to choose either the performer , the song or both that would compete at Eurovision . However , internal selections had also been held on occasions , which was the method of selection for the Dutch entry in 2013 . An internal selection would again be used in 2014 by AVROTROS .

 After the Netherlands qualified for the final for the first time in nine years at the 2013 contest , media interest was high over who would succeed Anouk as the Dutch representative at Eurovision in 2014 . One of the artists tipped early on as a possible candidate was DJ Armin van Buuren , who announced in June 2013 that he was open to participating at the contest as long as AVROTROS gave him full artistic freedom and abandoned plans for a national final to select the entry . <unk> Rouse , one of the backing singers for Anouk at the 2013 contest , was another candidate mentioned after being promoted by Anouk at several events in 2013 . 
 On 5 November 2013 , <unk> announced that they would publish the name of the Dutch entrant on 25 November . On the same day , various news media reported that DeLange , well known in the Netherlands for several pop and country hits and as a juror on The Voice of Holland , had been selected by the broadcaster . Also reported was that Waylon , runner @-@ up in the first series of Holland 's Got Talent in 2008 , would represent the Netherlands with a song written by DeLange . Waylon had previously competed in the Dutch selection for Eurovision 2005 , but had failed to qualify for the final . Contrary to popular speculation , Van Buuren announced on 13 November that he would not be the Dutch entrant . 
 At a press conference on 25 November 2013 at the <unk> Studios in Hilversum , AVROTROS announced that DeLange and Waylon would both represent the Netherlands at the 2014 Eurovision contest , performing as a duo under the name The Common Linnets . The band 's name , taken from a songbird commonly found in rural areas of the Netherlands , can also be a colloquial term for " homely country folk . " Having known each other since adolescence , the two artists had been working on an album in Nashville as a " side project " when the idea of competing at Eurovision as a duo was formed . 
 On 4 March 2014 during the Dutch talkshow De <unk> <unk> Door the group announced that " Calm After the Storm " would be the title of their Eurovision entry . The first public performance of the song was an acoustic version on the same show on 12 March , while the official version premièred on the radio show De Gouden Uren the following day . The official music video of the song , directed by Paul <unk> , was released on 17 March . 
 = = = Promotion = = = 
 A small European promotional tour was planned for The Common Linnets , visiting smaller countries such as San Marino and Malta , as well as neighbouring Belgium . However it was later decided that the group would focus their attention before Eurovision on media in the Netherlands , promoting their self @-@ titled début album and DeLange 's theatre tour , and would then turn their focus to international promotion on their arrival in Denmark . This method proved successful for " Calm After the Storm " in the Netherlands , having sold over 10 @,@ 000 copies by April 2014 and earning the song a gold record .

 Since 2009 , Eurovision in Concert has been held in the Netherlands , and has become the largest gathering of Eurovision artists outside of the concert itself . Created by a group of Dutch Eurovision fans , the event was designed to keep the spirit in Eurovision alive in the Netherlands after several disappointing results for the Netherlands and declining interest in the contest in the country . 
 The 2014 event , attended by 1 @,@ 500 Eurovision fans , was held on 5 April 2014 in the Melkweg music venue in Amsterdam . It featured 25 of the competing countries from the 2014 Eurovision , including the Dutch act The Common Linnets . The event was hosted by singer Sandra <unk> , former Dutch Eurovision representative at the 1972 , 1976 and 1979 contests , and Dutch Eurovision commentator <unk> Maas . Special guests included 2013 Eurovision winner Emmelie de Forest and <unk> <unk> , Dutch representative in the 1986 contest . Jan <unk> <unk> , the Head of Show for the 2014 contest , also made a short presentation where the press were shown how the stage would look , as well as a presentation of the postcards for some of the participating countries .

 All countries except the " Big 5 " ( France , Germany , Italy , Spain and the United Kingdom ) and the host country , were required to qualify from one of two semi @-@ finals in order to compete for the final ; the top ten countries from each semi @-@ final progressed to the final . The European Broadcasting Union split up the competing countries into six different pots based on voting patterns from previous contests , with countries with favourable voting histories put into the same pot . On 20 January 2014 , a special allocation draw was held which placed each country into one of the two semi @-@ finals , as well as which half of the show they would perform in . The Netherlands was placed into the first semi @-@ final , to be held on 6 May 2014 , and was scheduled to perform in the second half of the show . 
 Once all the competing songs for the 2014 contest had been released , the running order for the semi @-@ finals was decided by the show 's producers rather than through another draw , so that similar songs were not placed next to each other . The Netherlands was set to perform in position 14 , after the entry from Portugal and before the entry from Montenegro . 
 All three shows were broadcast by Nederland 1 and satellite channel <unk> , with commentary provided by <unk> Maas and Jan Smit . The Dutch spokesperson , who announced the Dutch votes during the final , was Tim <unk> .

 The Common Linnets took part in technical rehearsals on 29 April and 2 May , followed by dress rehearsals on 5 and 6 May . This included the jury final where professional juries of each country , responsible for 50 percent of each country 's vote , watched and voted on the competing entries . 
 The Dutch stage show featured DeLange and Waylon using a specially @-@ designed microphone stand to allow them to face each other , both playing guitars , while a bassist , a drummer and a cellist performed in the background . Low lighting was used throughout the performance , with large swooping camera shots at the beginning and end of the song implemented along with several close @-@ ups during the rest of the performance . On the floor of the stage LED screens simulated road markings , while further screens on the background showed a rainy forest scene , transforming into a dry forest scene towards the end of the song 's performance . 
 At the end of the show , the Netherlands was announced as having finished in the top ten and subsequently qualifying for the grand final . It was later revealed that the Netherlands won the semi @-@ final , receiving a total of 150 points .

 Shortly after the first semi @-@ final , a winner 's press conference was held for the ten qualifying countries . As part of this press conference , the qualifying artists took part in a draw to determine which half of the grand final they would subsequently participate in . This draw was done in the order the countries were announced during the semi @-@ final . The Netherlands was drawn to compete in the second half . Following the second semi @-@ final , where the remaining ten qualifiers for the final were decided , the show 's producers decided upon the running order of the final , as they had done for the semi @-@ finals . The Netherlands were subsequently placed to perform in position 24 , following the entry from Denmark and before the entry from San Marino . Following their qualification , the Netherlands was considered to be a major competitor for the Eurovision title , with bookmakers on the day of the final considering the Netherlands to be the third most likely country to win the competition . 
 The Common Linnets once again took part in dress rehearsals on 9 and 10 May before the final , including the jury final where the professional juries cast their final votes before the live show . After a short technical delay following the Danish entry , the group performed a repeat of their semi @-@ final performance during the final , and finished in second place at the end of the voting behind the winning entry from Austria , receiving a total of 238 points and having received 12 points , the maximum number of points a country can give to another , from eight countries .

 Voting during the three shows consisted of 50 percent public televoting and 50 percent from a jury deliberation . The jury consisted of five music industry professionals who were citizens of the country they represent , with their names published before the contest to ensure transparency . This jury was asked to judge each contestant based on : vocal capacity ; the stage performance ; the song 's composition and originality ; and the overall impression by the act . In addition , no member of a national jury could be related in any way to any of the competing acts in such a way that they cannot vote impartially and independently .

He reveals that she has just 30 minutes to decide whether to stay behind in Erinsborough or leave with him . However , when she makes the choice to leave , she has trouble convincing her younger sister to come too . 
 The soap 's executive producer , Susan Bower , revealed that the team wanted Mark " to go out with a bang " and they took inspiration from the US drama 24 to create a special real @-@ time episode . The show 's script producer thought the technique was " the best way to do justice " to the character and his exit , although it proved to be a challenge for the crew as it was different from the normal storytelling process . " Episode 6188 " focused on a 30 @-@ minute timeframe between 6 : 30 pm and 7 : 00 pm , which is when Neighbours is broadcast in Australia . The episode was filmed over two nights and extra effort went into ensuring the continuity was right throughout .

 In February 2011 , McGregor announced his departure from Neighbours and a Herald Sun reporter stated that he would film his final scenes in April . On screen , his character was seen exposing corruption within the local police force and then receiving threats from some of his colleagues . McGregor later explained to a Press Association reporter that Mark 's exit storyline would not be a happy one , as he is forced out of Ramsay Street . Mark is asked to enter a witness protection program and the night before he leaves , he realises he is still in love with his ex @-@ girlfriend , Kate ( Brewer ) . McGregor told Sarah Ellis of Inside Soap " He hasn 't been able to tell Kate that he 's leaving before now – but he just can 't say goodbye , and asks her to come along with him . It 's such a very big ask , so of course she has to give it a lot of thought . " 
 Mark 's departure was shown during a special real @-@ time episode , which focused on a 30 @-@ minute timeframe . Executive producer Susan Bower revealed that the team wanted Mark " to go out with a bang " and commented that while the episode features about half a dozen people , it is mostly about Mark and Kate . The show 's script producer , Emma Gordon , agreed that the real @-@ time episode was " the best way to do justice " to the character and his exit . McGregor explained that while the producers were planning his character 's exit , they took inspiration from the US drama 24 . Gordon admitted to Tiffany Fox from The West Australian that the technique was a real challenge for Neighbours . She said " It is a bit different and a bit out of our normal storytelling process but it gives such a sense of tension which is exactly the feeling we wanted to create . When you have half an hour to make a decision that will affect the rest of your life , every excruciating minute counts . "

 The episode sees Mark reveal that he only has 30 minutes before he has to leave for witness protection . He then tries to convince Kate to come with him . The storyline takes place between 6 : 30pm and 7 : 00pm , which is when Neighbours airs in Australia . The episode was filmed over two nights and Gordon told Fox that extra effort went into ensuring the continuity was " perfect . " Every minute had to be accounted for , including the commercial breaks and the time taken up by the actors walking from one house to another . Gordon commented that clocks and watches are used throughout the episode to keep the tension high . During an interview with a Channel 5 website reporter , Brewer said that filming the episode was similar to filming a regular episode of the soap , as the scenes were still shot out of order . She thought it was nice working in a short time period that did not jump from day to day . During the filming of the final scenes on location , the weather took a turn for the worse and it began to rain . However , Gordon added that it looked " spectacular and adds such an atmosphere . " 
 Brewer told a Channel 5 website writer that the rain was the biggest challenge of the night shoot , as it was " beyond freezing " . She also revealed that she ran in shoes that she had not broken in and they made her feet bleed . The actress added " It was incredibly stressful but I guess it was stress in a good way . There were months of preparation involved so that it could run like clockwork . So I guess it was stressful in the sense the emotional stakes were heightened for a two @-@ week period . It was exhausting and I think we can all say we were happy once it was over . But the final result was worth it . " McGregor filmed his final scene out of sequence at the Melbourne studios .

 Batman : Anarky is a 1999 trade paperback published by DC Comics . The book collects prominent appearances of Anarky , a comic book character created by Alan Grant and Norm Breyfogle . Although all of the collected stories were written by Alan Grant , various artists contributed to individual stories . Dual introductions were written by the creators — both of whom introduce the character and give insight into their role in Anarky 's creation and development . 
 Featured as an antagonist in various Batman comics during the ' 90s , stories based on the character were highly thematic , political , and philosophical in tone . The majority of the collected stories ( " Anarky in Gotham City " , " Anarky : Tomorrow Belongs to Us " , " Anarky " ) are influenced by the philosophy of anarchism , while the final story ( " Metamorphosis " ) is influenced by Frank R. Wallace . Although anti @-@ statism is the overarching theme of the collection , other concepts are explored . Anarky 's characterization was expanded throughout the stories to present him first as a libertarian socialist and anarchist , and in the final story as a vehicle for explorations into atheism , rationalism , and bicameralism . Literary references are also utilized throughout the collected stories to stress the philosophical foundations of the character . The collection also tracks the character 's evolution from a petty , street @-@ crime fighting vigilante , to a competent freedom fighter in opposition to powerful forces of evil . 
 Critics have positively received some of the stories within the collection , analyzing Anarky as a unique force for political commentary and discussion within DC Comics ' storytelling . However , the expansive growth of the character 's unique abilities and characterization has also fueled criticism as having overpowered the character beyond suspension of disbelief .

 In the late ' 80s , writer Alan Grant considered drawing upon his own anarchist sympathies and utilizing them for a character in the Detective Comics , which he was writing at the time . In a bid to replicate the success of Chopper , a rebellious youth in the " Judge Dredd " comic strip , Grant created Anarky as a twelve @-@ year @-@ old political radical , far more mature , violent , and intelligent than his peers . Influenced by V , the protagonist of Alan Moore 's V for Vendetta , Grant 's only instructions to illustrator Norm Breyfogle were that Anarky be designed as a cross between V and the black spy from Mad magazine 's Spy vs. Spy . In his own intro to the collection , Norm Breyfogle explains that , pressured by deadlines , and failing to recognize the character 's long @-@ term potential , he " made no preliminary sketches , simply draping [ Anarky ] in long red sheets " . As the character was intended to wear a costume that disguised his youth , Breyfogle designed a crude " head extender " that elongated Anarky 's neck , creating a jarring appearance . 
 The first appearance of Anarky was in " Anarky in Gotham City " , Detective Comics # 608 , in November 1989 . Grant 's initial script portrayed Anarky as vicious , killing his first victim . Dennis O 'Neil , then editor of Detective Comics , balked at this proposal , believing that the depiction of a twelve @-@ year @-@ old becoming a murderer was morally reprehensible . Grant consented to O 'Neil 's request that the script be changed , and rewrote it to portray Anarky as violent , but non @-@ lethal . Grant later expressed relief with this early decision , coming to believe that " Anarky would have compromised his own beliefs if he had taken the route of the criminal @-@ killer . " 
 Although Grant had not created Anarky to be used beyond the two @-@ part debut story , the positive reception Anarky received among readers and his editor caused Grant to change his mind . In the following years , Grant developed the character to contrast with typical heroic characters . Based on a theme of philosophy , Anarky was not given a tragic past — a common motivator in comic books — but was instead given motivation by his convictions and beliefs . In his introduction to the trade paperback , Grant compared this with Batman , who fought crime due to personal tragedy . Grant also contrasted Anarky with common teenage superheroes . Rejecting the tradition established by Stan Lee and Jack Kirby , Grant avoided saddling Anarky with personal problems , a girlfriend , or social life . This was intended to convey the idea that Anarky was self @-@ assured in his goals . The singular problem the character did have was tending to his secret activities while escaping from juvenile detention centers , or hiding his actions from his parents , who did not approve of his activism . These aspects of the character were incorporated into " Anarky : Tomorrow Belongs to Us " and " Anarky " , each respectively published in 1995 , as this period of the character 's portrayal came to a conclusion . 
 Leading into the character 's next phase of publication , the Anarky limited series , " Metamorphosis " , was published in 1997 . Coinciding with Alan Grant 's transition from the philosophy of anarchism to Neo @-@ Tech , Grant chose to re @-@ characterize Anarky accordingly . Norm Breyfogle also took the opportunity to redesign Anarky 's costume , excising the head extender with the explanation that the character had grown up and filled out his costume . The golden mask was also redesigned as a reflective but flexible material that wrapped around Anarky 's head , allowing for the display of facial movement and emotion which had previously been impossible due to the inflexible metal that the first mask was made of . 
 With the success of the limited series , Darren Vincenzo , an assistant editor at DC Comics , and the editor of the Anarky mini @-@ series , promoted the continuation of the comic into a regular monthly title . In the lead @-@ up to the publication of both ventures , Breyfogle and Grant wrote introductory essays intended for the trade paperback in June 1998 . Breyfogle also continued the character costume adjustments he 'd begun for the limited series . Fully redesigning the suit , Breyfogle retained the red jumpsuit , flexible gold mask , and hat , but eliminated the red robes in favor of a more traditional outfit . New additions to the suit included a red cape , golden utility belt , and a single , large Circle @-@ A insignia across the chest , akin to Superman 's iconic " S " shield . Batman : Anarky was published several months later with the new costume featured on the cover page , despite the fact that it does not appear in any of the collected stories . 
 = = = Collected comics = = = 
 Published on February 22 , 1999 , Batman : Anarky collected nine Batman @-@ related comic books , comprising four unique stories connected by their featured character : Anarky . The collected material , originally published in 1989 , 1995 , and 1997 , includes Anarky 's first appearance ; the revelation of Anarky 's origin story ; and Anarky 's first limited series . 
 The first story , " Anarky in Gotham City " , was published in Detective Comics # 608 and # 609 . Although Anarky was not intended to be used beyond this debut story , the positive reception the character received convinced Alan Grant to continue using the character in future issues . The next collected story , " Anarky : Tomorrow Belongs to Us " , was published in The Batman Chronicles # 1 . Published quarterly , this comic anthology collected short stories with an emphasis on Batman supporting characters . The eponymous story , " Anarky " , was originally published in Batman : Shadow of the Bat # 40 and # 41 . The only storyline in the collection which is not self @-@ contained , it alludes to other story elements taking place within the Batman mythos at the time , including the temporary resignation of Alfred Pennyworth and the mid @-@ life crisis of James Gordon . The story reveals Anarky 's origin story and includes the character 's faked death scene — an important plot point in the last collected story . 
 The last of these four stories , " Metamorphosis " , was published as a spin @-@ off limited series between May and August of 1997 , as a result of a request Norm Breyfogle made to DC Comics for employment following the comic book crash of the mid @-@ 1990s . Darren Vincenzo suggested multiple projects which Breyfogle could take part in , among them an Anarky mini @-@ series written by Alan Grant , which was eventually the project decided upon . The Anarky limited series was received with positive reviews and sales , and was later declared by Grant to be among his " career highlights " . With the continuation of the series as an ongoing monthly in 1999 , these four issues were retroactively categorized as the first Anarky volume . Both volumes of Anarky are unique as the only comic books ever thematically based on the philosophy of Neo @-@ Tech . 
 = = = Collection contributors = = = 
 Collecting four stories , Batman : Anarky gathers the work of a total of sixteen contributors employed by DC Comics over the course of eight years . While all of the collected stories were written by Alan Grant , contributing pencillers include Norm Breyfogle , Staz Johnson , and John Paul Leon , with various artists assisting as inkers , colorists , and <unk> . Each of the artists who worked on the Anarky limited series , " Metamorphosis " , would later return to continue their work on the Anarky ongoing series in 1999 . 
 Alan Grant , a writer from Scotland , got his start on 2000 AD as an assistant writer for John Wagner . Grant rose to prominence as an equal of Wagner 's in the creation of Judge Dredd comic strips . These stories were noted favorably for their use of socio @-@ political commentary and satire . Together , the duo acquired employment with DC Comics . Dennis O 'Neil assigned them to Detective Comics in 1988 , hoping they would bring their gritty , violent take on Judge Dredd to Batman storylines . Soon after , Wagner left the company , leaving Grant to continue the run on his own . Drawing on his work for Judge Dredd , Grant began injecting social commentary into the comic book , and avoided using common Batman rogues in favor of his own creations . Some of these villains were influenced by characters from the Judge Dredd universe . Anarky was conceived singularly by Grant as a result of these circumstances , and Grant 's own intellectual and philosophical meditations influenced the portrayal of the character over the following years . 
 Collaborating with Grant during these early years on Detective Comics was illustrator Norm Breyfogle , who designed and later modified the appearance of Anarky . Frequently noted as the co @-@ creator of the characters Alan Grant conceived of during their Detective Comics run together , <unk> has confessed to personally believing that this credit is unwarranted . <unk> that he merely drew the characters Grant conceived , he has nonetheless accepted credit for the development of Anarky , as he eventually took part in frequent correspondence over fax @-@ transmission with Grant during the Anarky limited series . These faxed letters to each other fueled discussion and debate regarding the character and plot development , and influenced both men in their later work . Of the collected illustrators , he is the only artist to have penciled more than a single story for the character . 
 Other contributing illustrators include Staz Johnson , who after penciling " Anarky : Tomorrow Belongs to Us " , would go on to work exclusively for DC Comics for several more years . Illustrator John Paul Leon collaborated on " Anarky " in 1995 , just a year after he received his Bachelor 's in Fine Arts from School of Visual Arts in 1994 . Steve Mitchell , the regular inker for Detective Comics during Grant and Breyfogle 's collaborative run , inked " Anarky in Gotham City " . Cam Smith , Ray McCarthy , and Josef Rubinstein completed the ink work for " Anarky : Tomorrow Belongs to Us " , " Anarky " , and " Metamorphosis , respectively . 
 Todd Klein , an award winning letter and logo designer , mainly worked for DC Comics during the 1980s . A freelancer , Klein designed logos and title headers for various comics , while at other times created lettering for many of the decades most prominent titles . Klein would also create the lettering for Alan Grant 's run on Detective Comics , where he would work together with Grant and Breyfogle in the creation of " Anarky in Gotham City . " Bill Oakley , a letterer well respected among his peers for his distinctive style , contributed to " Anarky : Tomorrow Belongs To Us " . John Costanza , who has won awards on multiple occasions in the field of comic book lettering , contributed to both " Anarky " and " Metamorphosis " . 
 Adrienne Roy , a colorist predominantly associated with many of the Batman franchise comics of the late ' 80s and early ' 90s , provided coloring for " Anarky in Gotham City " . Phil Allen was tapped for " Anarky : Tomorrow Belongs To Us " , while Sherilyn van Valkenburgh colored " Anarky " , as well as the Batman : Anarky cover illustration . After serving as color editor for Milestone Media between 1992 and 1995 , Noelle Giddings joined DC Comics and produced the coloring for " Metamorphosis " .

 During a late night drug raid , Batman , the vigilante protector of Gotham City , discovers that the drug dealer he was tracking has already been assaulted and left for police to find . Next to his unconscious body is a spray painted Circle @-@ A , announcing the arrival of a new vigilante , Anarky . Anarky continues his war against crime by targeting a business owner dumping pollutants in a river . Batman recognizes his M.O. and realizes he is attacking people based on the complaints raised in letters to the editor in a local newspaper . He alerts the police , who plan stake @-@ outs at several events based on the letters . When Anarky strikes next , however , it is at a construction site unlisted in the paper . Anarky rallies the homeless to riot in response to the destruction of their " Cardboard City " , which has been bulldozed to build a new bank . Batman arrives but is attacked by the homeless mob so that Anarky may flee . The mob includes Legs , a homeless Vietnam veteran who Alan Grant would utilize as a partner for Anarky in future stories . Batman eventually catches Anarky , revealing him to be a disguised , twelve @-@ year @-@ old paperboy named Lonnie Machin . As a child prodigy with extensive knowledge of both radical philosophy and improvised munitions , Lonnie was confident that violent change was necessary to improve social conditions . Batman condemns his actions , but expresses admiration for his idealism .

 While serving time in a juvenile correction facility , Lonnie Machin creates a makeshift hologram projector and two @-@ way communicator , and uses it to leave the impression that he is still held in detention . He then escapes and sabotages a politician 's ad campaign in order to promote anti @-@ electoral propaganda , with the assistance of Legs , who acts as a diversion against a local guard . Anarky uses his communicator during his adventure to carryout a political dialogue with his fellow detainees , narrowly returning before guards notice his absence . 
 = = = " Anarky " = = = 
 Several months after the events of " Anarky : Tomorrow Belongs to Us " , Lonnie Machin has been released from juvenile detention on parole , and uses the internet to create a company , " Anarco " . Through Anarco , Machin sells anarchist literature online , secretly acquiring millions of dollars . He channels this wealth through a proxy organization , " The Anarkist Foundation " , to donate the funds to political groups he supports , including gun protesters , eco @-@ warriors , and clean energy lobbies . Meanwhile , he successfully hides this activity from his parents , Mike and Roxanne Machin , who do not approve of his behavior , believing themselves to have failed to raise their son properly . Their relationship with him becomes strained , as they attempt to rehabilitate him into normality , while he wishes they would be proud of his vigilante activism . Continuing his secret philanthropy , he supports Malochia , a self @-@ proclaimed " prophet of doom " who spreads a message that current social conditions are intolerable . Anarky comes to suspect that this " prophet " has an ulterior motive , and hires private detective , Joe Potato , to investigate his actions . Meanwhile , Batman and Robin have also placed Malochia under their watch , and discover his connections to <unk> Machin . Anarky , Joe Potato , and Batman confront Malochia , but are each captured and tied to a blimp . The blimp is loaded with high explosives and set to detonate near the center of the city . Malochia hopes this act will set into effect his own delusional predictions of calamity . Anarky and Joe Potato revive and steer the blimp towards the water front , still set to explode . Anarky releases both Potato and Batman into the water , but is tangled in ropes and presumably caught in the explosion . During the story , Lonnie 's parents find a letter he wrote in the event of his death . The letter acts as a literary device to explain his origin as Anarky and the personal reasons behind his decision to become a vigilante . Lonnie Machin 's father and mother , Mike and Roxanne raise their son to be a happy child , and encourage his intelligence and thirst for knowledge with trips to bookstores . Through his research , Lonnie eventually grows to become the political radical , Anarky . 
 = = = " Metamorphosis " = = = 
 " Metamorphosis " chronicles Machin 's narrow survival of an explosion and use of the confusion in its aftermath to fake his death . Several months later , he is now stated to be fifteen @-@ years old and has begun a new plan to liberate the world of government . As Anarky , he attempts to create a device which will emit beams of light on frequencies which will trigger the human brain of all who see it . The people will then be " de @-@ brainwashed " of all the social constraints which society has placed on the individual . Utilizing a makeshift teleportation device capable of summoning a boom tube , he begins a quest to capture the power sources his invention will need : the madness of Etrigan , the evil of Darkseid , and the goodness of Batman . Desiring to tempt Batman into confronting him , Anarky successfully lures Batman 's attention by hiring Legs and other homeless men to monitor Batman 's movements . During the confrontation between Anarky and Batman , the device is damaged . Thus , when Machin activates it , it only affects himself . The vision that follows reveals what may have happened if he had succeeded , with nightmarish consequences . In the hallucination , the slightest infraction against a smooth @-@ running society is met with banishment to a prison @-@ city . The effects of his machine eventually wear off , and the most dangerous elements of the prison escape , causing havoc . The conclusion Anarky draws from this is that if society is to change , individuals must accept that change voluntarily . When Batman turns off the machine , Anarky awakens and promptly escapes , vowing to continue his mission , " until they all learn to choose for themselves ... " 
 = = Themes = = 
 = = = Literary references = = = 
 Within the books , the nature of the character 's political opinions was often expressed through his rhetoric , and by heavy use of the Circle @-@ A as a character gimmick . However , other themes were often used when Anarky was a featured character in a comic . In early stories , books would often be referenced to express the character 's philosophical agenda . The earliest example of this was in the " Anarky in Gotham City " and " Anarky " storylines , in which Anarky makes references to Universe by Scudder Klyce , an extremely rare book , and cites passages within it as having inspired his actions . Various books can be seen in Lonnie Machin 's bedroom in the " Anarky " storyline , including tomes named after the ancient Greek philosophers Plato and Aristotle , and the Swedish scientist , Emanuel Swedenborg . Within the same storyline , Anarky 's father comments on the political books in the teenager 's room , referring to the Russian anarchist , Mikhail Bakunin , German philosopher , Karl Marx and the founder of Objectivism , Ayn Rand . " The " Metamorphosis " storyline later continued the theme , displaying an edition of Buckminster Fuller 's <unk> near the story 's climax . When asked if he was concerned readers would be unable to follow some of the more obscure literary references , Grant responded that he didn 't expect many to do so , but was " pleased to say several did , " and reported carrying on a correspondence with at least one reader over the course of several years . Besides books , fluttering newspapers were also used as a literary element to convey ideas , often included in street settings and bearing headlines alluding to social problems such as white @-@ collar crime and poverty . Several newspapers also include the titles of political books on their pages . One page bears the title of Noam Chomsky 's series of interviews with David Barsamian , Keeping the Rabble in Line ; another Bill Devall 's <unk> : The Tragedy of Industrial Forestry ; while a third refers to Urban Indians : Drums from the cities by Gregory W. Frazier . 
 = = = Philosophical shift = = = 
 As an antagonist in a limited number of Batman comics during the 90 's , Anarky was largely reserved for stories in which Grant wished to press a political point . Early incarnations of Anarky portrayed the character as an anarchist , and were intended to act as a medium for Grant 's personal meditations on political philosophy , and specifically for his own anarchist , socialist , and populist leanings . However , according to Grant , anarchists with whom he associated were hostile to his creation of the character , seeing it as an act of recuperation for commercial gain . With libertarian socialism being the primary theme of the first three storylines in the collection , other concepts explored in the stories were informed by the umbrella of anarchist theory . Anti @-@ <unk> and the tactic of non @-@ voting are the dual focuses of " Anarky : Tomorrow Belongs to Us " , while economic exploitation , environmental issues , and political corruption are repeatedly referenced in the three remaining stories . 
 Over the course of several years , Grant 's political opinions shifted from libertarian socialism to free market @-@ based philosophies . Alan Grant commented on the philosophical pattern the character 's transformation took for a 1997 interview : " Although I haven ’ t read them in chronological order I would think it would be quite easy to see the parallel between Anarky ’ s thought processes and my own thought processes . " By 1997 he had settled on the philosophy of Neo @-@ Tech , a philosophy developed by Frank R. Wallace . At approximately the same time he was when given the opportunity to write an Anarky mini @-@ series , and so decided to revamp the character accordingly . Grant laid out his reasoning in an interview just before the first issue 's publication . " I felt he was the perfect character " to express Neo @-@ Tech philosophy , Grant explained , " because he 's human , he has no special powers , the only power he 's got is the power of his own rational consciousness " . This new characterization was later carried on in the 1999 Anarky ongoing series . 
 The " Metamorphosis " storyline led the character away from many of the philosophical concepts previously espoused , but the primary theme of the collection remained anti @-@ statism . New emphasis was placed on previously unexplored themes , including the mind , consciousness and bicameralism . Anarky 's characterization was also expanded to present him as an atheist and rationalist . A recurring theme in " Metamorphosis " was a scene of Anarky expounding philosophy to his pet dog , and indirectly to the reader , for a single page in each part of the story , for a total of four pages . These monologues included an explanation of bicameralism , a comparative summary of the political philosophy of Plato and Aristotle , a description of the concept of economic " parasites , " and a final description of how the elimination of irrationality would allow society to progress . Another important theme to the final storyline is a discourse on the nature of evil , as a subplot of the story . Anarky 's pursuit , as Grant put it , " ... is to find out why anyone would make the decision to be evil . " To that end , Grant pitted Anarky against Etrigan and Darkseid with the intention of providing a setting for a series of dialogues on the topic . 
 = = = Heroic evolution = = = 
 Aside from the philosophical themes present throughout the collection , the steady progression of Anarky 's abilities and enemies is also highlighted . In the earliest stories , Anarky 's targets are minor criminals , contrasting with the last story , " Metamorphosis " . This final story portrays Anarky facing more dangerous opponents — those who , as Grant wrote , are " virtual embodiments of evil " . Anarky 's steady growth in fighting ability , technological innovation , and wealth is also documented within the collection . In " Anarky in Gotham City " , Lonnie Machin is described as being highly intelligent , but lacking in any other skill . This changed in " Anarky " , where he begins developing his skills in hand to hand combat , begins experimenting on his brain to increase his intelligence , and creates a front company to begin amassing money . By the final storyline , Anarky is capable of creating advanced , high tech gadgets and devices , such as a teleportation device ; has fused his brain and magnified his intelligence to genius levels ; has studied multiple styles of martial arts , and created his own hybrid martial art ; and has millions of dollars with which to fund his plans . 
 The progression of Anarky 's abilities was also mirrored by the change in the character 's costume . The design shift from an early suit intended to disguise Lonnie 's age , to one that fit him more fully , was commented on by Norm Breyfogle , who wrote , " … during his existence he 's gained quite a few inches and pounds , filling out his costume ! The change from black eyes to white may also be seen as indicating that Lonnie 's real eyes now peer out of the mask . He 's literally grown into the role ! "

Rahul 's grandfather dies on the eve of the celebration , just when he witnesses Sachin Tendulkar on TV in a cricket match get dismissed on his 99th run . His grandmother tells Rahul that his grandfather wanted his ashes to be divided into two parts — one of each to be immersed in the Ganges and Rameswaram . She asks Rahul to take the ashes to Rameswaram and disperse them . Reluctantly , he accepts her request but is also eager to attend the Goa trip . Rahul and his friends plan to dump the ashes at Goa but his grandmother wants to see him off , forcing Rahul to travel by train .

 Along with Once Upon ay Time in Mumbai Dobaara ! , Chennai Express was initially abandoned by Pakistani distributors and exhibitors because four Pakistani films were released on the same day .

The state 's relief and rehabilitation minister , <unk> Kadam , addressed the problem . 
 The film 's poster and trailer , released on Twitter and YouTube , were criticised by some Tamil media for their depiction of Tamil ethos . They said Padukone 's heavily accented dialogue resembled a Malayalee accent rather than a Tamil one . Padukone defended the film , saying that it did not parody South Indian culture and that most of the crew , including herself , are South Indians . She later said , " Why would we spoof our own culture ? " 
 On 31 July 2013 , the Nationalist political party Maharashtra Navnirman Sena 's film wing threatened to disrupt the film 's premiere ; it reportedly attempted to dislodge ongoing popular Marathi movies from cinemas that show only one film at a time . The party was upset with reports that the distributors of Chennai Express had demanded prime slots in single screen cinemas , and at some multiplexes , where the superhit Marathi film <unk> had been popular since 19 July . On 1 August 2013 , both the film directors , Rohit Shetty and Sanjay Jadhav were called on by Raj Thackeray to find a solution .

 " The Girl Is Mine " is a song recorded by Michael Jackson and Paul McCartney . The track was written by Jackson and produced by Jackson and Quincy Jones . It was released as the first single for Jackson 's sixth solo album , Thriller ( 1982 ) . The song was recorded at Westlake Studios , Los Angeles , from April 14 to 16 , 1982 . The year before , Jackson and McCartney had recorded " Say Say Say " and " The Man " for the latter 's fifth solo album , Pipes of Peace ( 1983 ) . Although it was released as a single , Jackson never performed the song live . 
 " The Girl Is Mine " achieved success in the music charts . Aside from topping the R & B singles chart , the single peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 and number eight in the UK . By 1985 , it had sold 1 @.@ 3 million copies , and was eventually certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America , for shipments of at least one million units . Despite the song 's success , it received generally mixed reviews from critics who consider it to be the weakest song on Thriller . 
 " The Girl Is Mine " has been the subject of two plagiarism lawsuits , the first in 1984 and the latter in 1993 . Both instances required Jackson to testify in court , and each lawsuit found in the favour of the singer and his record label . 
 In 2008 , for the 25th anniversary edition of Thriller , Black Eyed Peas singer will.i.am remixed " The Girl Is Mine " . The remix received generally unfavourable reviews from music critics .

 The writing of " The Girl Is Mine " was completed by Jackson as he watched cartoons with Paul McCartney . Producer Quincy Jones had initially told Jackson to write a song about two men fighting over a girl . Inspired , Jackson awoke during the night and sang the song into a tape recorder . He later said , " I sang exactly what I heard in my head , starting with the melody and the keyboard and the strings and everything . So , I just orally put it all on tape . " Jones also asked Jackson to add a rap verse . The song was then recorded by Jackson and McCartney at Westlake Studios , Los Angeles , from April 14 to 16 , 1982 . The year before , the duo had recorded " Say Say Say " and " The Man " for McCartney 's fifth solo album , Pipes of Peace ( 1983 ) . 
 Jackson said that the recording of " The Girl Is Mine " was one of his most enjoyable moments in the studio . He stated , " One of my favourite songs to record , of all my recordings as a solo artist , is probably " The Girl Is Mine " , because working with Paul McCartney was pretty exciting and we just literally had fun . It was like lots of <unk> and playing , and throwing stuff at each other , and making jokes . We actually recorded the ( instrumental ) track and the vocals pretty much live at the same time , and we do have footage of it , but it 's never been shown . " He concluded , " Maybe one day we 'll give you a sneak preview of it . " The footage of the pair was later shown at The Paul McCartney World Tour . 
 Many members of the band Toto participated in the recording of this song , including David Paich ( piano ) , Jeff Porcaro ( drums ) , Steve Lukather ( guitars ) and Steve Porcaro ( synthesizers ) .

 The musical structuring of " The Girl Is Mine " uses the AABA form , in which the song 's title serves as the main source of needed repetition . When used to the maximum , this structuring , also known as the thirty @-@ two @-@ bar form , has the title repeat itself in the same place , in at least two of the three A verses . Author Sheila Davis ' book , The Craft of Lyric Writing , notes that " the repeated title line simultaneously outlines the framework of the design and drives home the main point of the lyric " . Jackson 's " She 's Out of My Life " also uses this musical structuring , as does " Body and Soul " , " Oh , Lady Be Good ! " and " Try a Little Tenderness " . The musical chords in " The Girl Is Mine " are seen in several songs written by Jackson . " That 's What You Get for Being <unk> " , from The Jacksons ' Destiny album , and two unreleased songs ( " Why Can 't I Be " and " Thank You for Life " ) used the chords before " The Girl Is Mine " .

 Despite recording " Say Say Say " and " The Man " a year prior , " The Girl Is Mine " was the first song to gain a release from the duo and the first single from the Thriller album . " The Girl Is Mine " was released as a single on October 18 , 1982 . The single 's cover photograph was taken by McCartney 's wife , Linda . Listeners were not impressed by " The Girl Is Mine " , and thought that Jackson 's Thriller would also be a disappointment . The public felt that Jackson and the producer , Quincy Jones , had created a song for the white pop audience . Despite some of the public 's concerns , " The Girl Is Mine " achieved success in the music charts . Topping the R & B singles chart , the single peaked at number two on the Billboard Hot 100 ( behind " Maneater " by Hall & Oates and " Down Under " by Men at Work ) and the Norwegian Singles Chart . " The Girl Is Mine " reached number one on the Hot Adult Contemporary Tracks chart . The song charted at number eight in the UK , peaking within the New Zealand Top 20 . By 1985 , the single had sold 1 @.@ 3 million copies . The single was later certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America , for shipments of at least one million units . 
 Since its release , " The Girl Is Mine " has received mixed reviews from journalists and music critics . Journalist Robert Christgau described the pairing of McCartney and Jackson as " Michael 's worst idea since " Ben " " . Rolling Stone stated that the song was a " <unk> MOR [ middle of the road ] ballad " and that McCartney was " tame " . Stephen Erlewine of Allmusic noted that the song had a " sweet schmaltz " . Jackson 's breakdown with the " irrepressibly silly Paul McCartney " was " disarmingly goofy " , according to Stylus Magazine . Salon.com later described " The Girl Is Mine " as a " sappy duet " . They concluded that McCartney had become a " wimpy old fart " . The song garnered a favourable review from Jackson 's biographer , J. Randy Taraborrelli . The writer stated that the song was " cute " but lacked substance . He added that the track had a " middle @-@ of @-@ the @-@ road calm " and was the antithesis of the " rambunctious " " Beat It " .
