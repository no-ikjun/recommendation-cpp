 In the wake of the shooting , Democrats and Republicans both called for a cooling of political rhetoric and a return to bipartisanship . On the eve of the shooting , Giffords had written to a Republican friend , Trey Grayson , Secretary of State of Kentucky , saying , " we need to figure out how to tone our rhetoric and partisanship down . " In March 2010 , Giffords had expressed concern about the use of crosshairs on a national midterm election map on Sarah Palin 's campaign webpage denoting targeted congressional seats , including Giffords 's , in Arizona 's 8th district . Shortly after the map 's posting and the subsequent vandalizing of her office that month , Giffords said , " We 're in Sarah Palin 's ' targeted ' list , but the thing is that the way she has it depicted , we 're in the crosshairs of a gun sight over our district . When people do that , they 've got to realize that there are consequences to that action . " At that point in the interview , however , the interviewer said , " campaign rhetoric and war rhetoric have been interchangeable for years . " The image was removed from Palin 's " <unk> " website following the January shootings . Palin responded to her critics in a January 12 video , rejecting the notion that anyone other than the gunman could bear any responsibility for the Tucson shooting , and accusing the press of manufacturing a " blood libel " to blame her and the right wing for the attacks . 
 The political climate in the United States and in Arizona in particular was pointed to by some observers as a possible contributing factor for the violent act . For example , Clarence <unk> , Pima County Sheriff , initially expressed concern that overheated political rhetoric and violence may be related , observing , " When you look at unbalanced people , how they respond to the vitriol that comes out of certain mouths about tearing down the government . The anger , the hatred , the bigotry that goes on in this country is getting to be outrageous . " He believed that Arizona had unfortunately become " the capital " of such feelings . " We have become the mecca for prejudice and bigotry , " he said . But , <unk> later said that he had no evidence that the killings were a result of anything particular which Loughner may have read or heard . International media referred to the political climate in the United States and the Palin map in particular . The French newspaper Le Monde said that the attack seemed to confirm " an alarming premonition that has been gaining momentum for a long time : that the verbal and symbolic violence that the most radical right @-@ wing opponents have used in their clash with the Obama administration would at some point lead to tragic physical violence . " President Obama called the shooting an " unspeakable tragedy " , adding that " such a senseless and terrible act of violence has no place in a free society " . Arizona Governor Jan Brewer called the attack " senseless and cruel violence " and House Speaker John Boehner said , " An attack on one who serves is an attack on all who serve . Acts and threats of violence against public officials have no place in our society " . Chief Justice John Roberts issued a statement noting , " we in the judiciary have suffered the terrible loss of one of our own " , with the death of Chief Judge John Roll . 
 Political figures such as Arizona 's United States Senators Jon Kyl and John McCain , House Majority Leader Eric Cantor , House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi issued statements . Numerous foreign politicians additionally commented on the shooting , including Canadian Foreign Affairs Minister Lawrence Cannon , British Prime Minister David Cameron , Spanish Prime Minister José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero , and Cuba 's Fidel Castro . The website <unk> , run by Giffords ' former opponent Jesse Kelly , was replaced with a single page urging support for Giffords and her family . 
 Senator Chuck Schumer called for a fresh look at gun control laws in the United States , including the possibility of prohibiting the sale of high @-@ capacity magazines , and prohibiting a person who has been rejected for military service due to drug use from owning a gun . Homeland Security Committee chairman Peter T. King announced that he would introduce a bill to ban the carrying of firearms within 1 @,@ 000 feet ( 300 m ) of certain federal officials . Representative Carolyn McCarthy announced that she would introduce legislation to ban the sale of high @-@ capacity ammunition magazines to civilians .

 Some media commentators , such as Howard Kurtz and Toby Harnden , criticized what they perceived as a rush to judgment about the shooter 's motivation , disputing suggestions that the shooting was the result of the Tea Party movement or anything in connection to Palin . Paul Krugman wrote an op @-@ ed piece arguing that political rhetoric had become toxic . With renewed calls to tone down political rhetoric after the shooting , Keith Olbermann apologized for any of his own words that might have incited violence saying , " Violence , or the threat of violence , has no place in our Democracy , and I apologize for and repudiate any act or any thing in my past that may have even inadvertently encouraged violence . " Jon Stewart stated that he did not know whether or not the political environment contributed to the shooting , but , " For all the hyperbole and vitriol that 's become a part of our political process — when the reality of that rhetoric , when actions match the disturbing nature of words , we haven 't lost our capacity to be horrified . ... Maybe it helps us to remember to match our rhetoric with reality more often . "

 U.S. flags flown by the federal government were displayed at half @-@ staff from January 9 , 2011 until sunset on January 15 , 2011 in honor of the victims of the Tucson shooting . A national moment of silence was held at 11 : 00 am EST on January 10 , 2011 on the South Lawn of the White House as well as the steps of the United States Capitol . President Obama went to Tucson on January 12 where he met with the families of the victims and visited Giffords at her bedside in the medical center before attending the evening 's televised memorial ceremony where he delivered a memorial speech . 
 Among other memorials : when the Safeway store reopened after the shooting , the staff erected a makeshift memorial ; at the 2011 Major League Baseball All @-@ Star Game , Giffords ' intern , Daniel Hernandez Jr . , was accompanied onto the field by the families of the shooting victims , and threw the ceremonial first pitch ; and for the 2011 State of the Union Address , Senator Mark Udall of Colorado proposed that members of both houses sit together regardless of party , with one seat left empty in honor of Giffords . 
 Christina @-@ Taylor Green , the youngest of the victims , had wanted to attend college at Penn State University to study political science . In March 2011 , then @-@ university president Graham Spanier announced at a Board of Trustees meeting that because Green had " a profound impact on the university community " , she was memorialized with a brick on the Alumni Walk at the <unk> Family Alumni Center .

The members of the congregation agreed to appear on talk radio in exchange for dropping their plans to picket the funeral . 
 On Sunday , January 16 , 2011 , eight days after the shooting , Vietnam War veteran James Eric Fuller , who had been shot in the knee during the attack , was arrested for disorderly conduct at a town hall meeting . After Tucson Tea Party figure Trent Humphries , who had faulted Giffords for not having enough security , stated that gun control measures should not be discussed until all those killed in the shooting were buried , Fuller allegedly took a picture of Humphries and shouted , " You 're dead . " In an interview during the week after the shooting , Fuller had criticized Palin and what he called the " Tea Party crime @-@ syndicate " for promoting a divisive political climate before the attacks . The police then committed him to an undisclosed medical facility to undergo a psychiatric evaluation . A police spokesman stated that the hospital will determine when he will be released . Meanwhile , Humphries said that he was worried about Fuller 's threat , and the dozens of other angry e @-@ mails he received from people blaming right @-@ wing political rhetoric for contributing to the assassination attempt on Giffords .

 JIVE Records commissioned a music video for " Lucky " to be directed by Dave Meyers . According to Jocelyn Vena of MTV , Spears portrays " a melancholy movie star who wants nothing more than to have a little fun " . 
 The video begins with Spears telling a story about a very famous Hollywood actress named Lucky . Lucky is seen wearing a pink nightgown behind the curtains , standing on her billboard with fluffy white cotton balls attached to the edges , inside her mansion and shots of her out on the balcony . As beautiful and rich as she is , on set she sits on the star @-@ shape in the sky , as she is acting , she is looking quite distressed . After the first chorus , she goes to the hotel mansion to the flowers , then she leaves and sits down and gets a mirror . Next , Lucky opens the door to reveal a handsome man , who then takes her in his arms , as the director yells " Cut ! We 've got it " . Lucky then walks off @-@ set into the studio , replying to the director : " Finally ! We 've done it fifty @-@ million times ! " She then goes to have her hair and makeup done ; with Spears standing unnoticed and very worried looking by her side . Lucky is then seen in a shiny gray evening gown at the Academy Awards accepting her award for Best Actress . Lucky looks happy as she accepts it and smiles at her fans but is soon revealed that this is not true happiness . She makes her way away from her screaming fans and back into her limo , where she unexpectedly finds an ornate hand mirror that was used on the film set . She looks back to the crowd to see who has left it and sees Spears leaning forward in the crowd . The limo drives away , leaving Spears behind on the red carpet . The video ends with Lucky crying herself to sleep , her make @-@ up already stained on her face . The curtains close , ending the video . 
 A Billboard staff reviewer noted that the story " turned out to be less than pure fiction when the singer later went through personal problems in the very public eye . " Jarett Wieselman of the New York Post rated the video a C + and stated that : " Britney 's first Hollywood cautionary tale video didn 't seem quite as telling at the time , but with a little distance , the lyrics and concept seem so much sadder " . A writer of Rolling Stone said that " Lucky " is best known for " being the first Spears video to focus on what would become a recurring theme : her conflicted relationship to fame " . 
 = = Live performances and cover version = = 
 Spears performed " Lucky " for the first time during her Oops ! ... I Did It Again World Tour in 2000 . The performance of the song featured a navy theme . The track was also on the Dream Within a Dream Tour ( 2001 – 02 ) , where Spears emerged from the middle of a giant musical box on the stage as a ballerina , to perform the song in a medley with " Born to Make You Happy " and " Sometimes " , right after the performance of " Overprotected " . Spears also performed the song on several television appearances , including at the Top of the Pops Germany in 2000 , and at The Today Show . " Lucky " was included on the setlist of the Britney : Piece of Me , Spears ' Las Vegas residency show ( 2013 - 2015 ) . 
 Country singer Taylor Swift performed the song on her Speak Now World Tour on September 20 , 2011 located in Louisiana , as a tribute to Spears . Wearing her signature lilac dress , Swift started to play the first chords of " Lucky " on her guitar , while singing , " Early morning / She wakes up / With a knock , knock , knock on the the [ sic ] door / It 's time for makeup / Perfect smile / It 's you they 're all waiting for . " Scott Shetler of Pop Crush said that " the crowd energy for the Britney cover didn 't seem as high as when Swift covered Eminem in Detroit or Justin Bieber in Toronto . " Jenna Hally Rubenstein of MTV , however , praised the performance , and noted that the show 's crowd gave a positive reaction to the cover , saying , " though the video is sideways and features the amateur videographer 's own personal sing @-@ along , the excitement in her voice is a testament to Taylor 's song choice . Or in other words , we can almost guarantee that every normal , living , breathing Louisiana @-@ bred girl in attendance at Taylor 's show is also obsessed with Britney Spears . " Becky Bain of Idolator said that she had no doubts that Swift would cover a Spears song , but was surprised that the song Swift chose was " Lucky " . PopDust writer Katherine St Asaph said that " Lucky " is " one of the few Britney lyrics that could just as easily be written for / by Taylor and one of the few songs that wouldn ’ t need massive re @-@ arranging .

 Jim Abbott of the Orlando Sentinel described the book as " a breathless new biography " by Herbert . In a review in the Herald Sun , Blanche Clark was critical and said , " Herbert 's loose timeline is irritating , as is some of her glib commentary , such as : ' When her parents took her out to restaurants , she would use the <unk> as drum batons — music was clearly in the blood .

 Writing for Phoenix New Times , Nicki Escudero compared the book to an entry on Wikipedia . She wrote , " It 's sort of like a really expanded Wikipedia entry , if you like that type of thing , though Herbert 's voice shows that she 's definitely a fan , and the book isn 't completely unbiased — it 's a very revering [ sic ] tale of Gaga 's 24 @-@ year @-@ old life . " Sharon <unk> Chance reviewed the book for the Las Vegas Review @-@ Journal , and wrote , " Using references from many , many different sources , Herbert has put together a fairly solid biography of the new pop icon " .

 = Pierre Guillemin = 
 Pierre Guillemin ( 13 September 1887 – 18 August 1915 ) was a French rugby union player , who represented France , Paris and Racing Club de France ( RCF ) . 
 He was first selected to play for France in the Home Nations Championship of 1908 , playing in the games against England and Wales . The following year , he played against England and Ireland , and in 1910 , in all four Home Nations games . That year , he scored his only points for France , a try , against England in a close @-@ fought match , after which he gained a reputation for being amongst the best of the French forwards . 
 Guillemin 's final season playing for France was that of 1910 – 11 . The French press disapproved of his selection , noting that he was excessively violent and not very effective . In 1911 , France won its first ever official international match , beating Scotland 16 – 15 at home , but in the following game , away against England , the French were heavily beaten . Guillemin 's last match for France was against Wales ; he was dropped for the final game of the championship , against Ireland . He played on with RCF for one more season , playing in the team that was runner @-@ up in the Championnat de France . 
 An architect by profession , he became a lieutenant in the French infantry , and died on the front in the First World War after a reconnaissance mission in Bois le Prêtre in Belleville @-@ sur @-@ Meuse .

 Guillemin had been playing as a forward for Racing Club de France ( RCF ) in the Championnat de Paris since 1906 when he got the opportunity to trial for France . Ahead of the international matches against the Home Nations teams in 1908 , the Union des Sociétés Françaises de Sports Athlétiques ( <unk> ) organised two matches . The first was a North of France versus South match , after which a France team was formed to play against the Rest of France on 22 December at the Stade du Matin in Colombes . Guillemin was selected for the Rest . Ahead of the game , Reichel in Le Figaro gave France the odds of winning , since it had a heavier pack and better halfbacks , and also commented positively on Duval , Bonhomme and Guillemin . The Rest of France won 12 – 6 . The cohesion of the Rest 's threequarter line , all coming from Stade Français , was especially apparent , while the forwards , although weaker in the scrum , and lighter , played with more " valour " . As a result , many changes were made for the team to play England on 1 January 1908 : the captain , Marc <unk> , was dropped altogether , and Guillemin was one of several who won selection . 
 France hosted England at Colombes on 1 January 1908 for the third rugby encounter between the two nations . Although France lost the game 0 – 19 , the press did not consider it a crushing defeat , given that on the previous occasions England had scored 35 points and then 41 . During the first half , two French players departed the field injured , so that by the second half , England had the advantage in numbers and were able to control the game , which at the start had appeared ( to the French press ) to be well @-@ balanced . The forwards were considered to be at least equal to , if not better , than the English . Guillemin and Duval amongst the forwards , as well as the backs Hubert and Moure , drew praise from Reichel . 
 Guillemin was selected for the next game between Wales and France on 2 March in Cardiff , Wales . It was the first official match played between the two nations and 20 @,@ 000 spectators turned up to watch . It was clear from the start that Wales was by far the stronger team , scoring in the first three minutes and leading 17 – 4 at half time . By the end of the game , the home team had scored nine tries , three of which were converted , and a penalty ; France managed to score just one drop @-@ goal , although it was considered " magnificent " . 
 Guillemin then played a series of matches for le Sporting Club de Madrid , made up of current and former pupils , against Trinity College , Cambridge , the first of which was held on 3 March at Cambridge , and a return match on 26 March at Parc des Princes . 
 Guillemin was selected to play the touring Australians on 2 January 1909 , but the match was cancelled due to bad weather . 
 = = = 1908 – 10 = = = 
 In the trials match for the 1910 Five Nations Championship , Guillemin was selected to play for the Possibles against the Probables . The Probables won a close game 9 – 6 , and Guillemin was selected again to play for France . The fourth match between England and France was held at Leicester on 30 January 1909 . The English dominated from the start but the French put up a good fight , as both the English and French press reported . The French forwards were compared in their style of play with those of Ireland , with good footballing skills . Although the English won a fourth successive victory , 22 – 0 , it seemed as though the French game was beginning to develop . 
 On New Year 's Day 1910 , Wales hosted the French team , several of whose players were unable to attend due to the annual celebrations . For Wales , the match in Swansea was merely a " splendid preliminary canter " , and the home side was very much favourite to win . It was only the third match between the two nations : the first , held at Cardiff in 1908 , had proved popular due to the novelty . After the easy Welsh victory over France in Paris in 1909 , there was very little interest in the match in 1910 and few spectators turned up . Wales scored the first try from an intercepted pass in the first three minutes of the game but the French responded immediately with a try of their own . Nevertheless , despite the Welsh appearing not to take the game seriously , the Welsh lead at half @-@ time of 21 – 14 and ended with a score of 49 – 14 . 
 Scotland selected its best team for the encounter with France on 22 January at Inverleith , the first time it gave full international recognition to a French team . The French backs were said to be " very fast " , but the Scottish forwards far outplayed the French and the final score was 27 – 0 . 
 On 3 March , France played host to England at the Parc des Princes . England were victorious but it was a good contest , with the final score 3 – 11 . The French defended well , but England scored two tries and a conversion and were leading 0 – 8 at half time . After the break , the French played with " dash and spirit " , repeatedly coming close to scoring until , with 20 minutes to go , Guillemin chased a long kick from <unk> and scored a try , which went unconverted . For the final ten minutes , with an injury to Lane , France held on with fourteen men on the field . The French press was delighted not to have witnessed another crushing defeat , comparing the result with England 's recent score of 11 – 6 against Wales . As well as having improved in the ability to play the game , the fitness of the players was much improved , and they were able to keep going right to the end . The annihilation anticipated for the second half did not come , with each side scoring three points , Guillemin amongst the best of the French forwards . 
 = = = Final seasons : 1910 – 12 = = = 
 For the trials match between the Probables and the Possibles on 18 December 1910 at Colombes , Guillemin played for the Probables and was then selected for France . G. <unk> writing in la Culture physique , considered that the selectors had made the right choice of XV , with the exception of Guillemin . In his opinion , it was deplorable that he should be selected , noting his " remarkable brutality " , proof of which he demonstrated in the trials match , and that he ought to be thrown out of the national team for all time . Reichel in Le Figaro agreed that Guillemin 's play was more violent than effective and would have preferred the selection of Berneron , who did " great work " for the Possibles . 
 Guillemin was a member of the team that beat Scotland at Colombes in 1911 and won France 's first victory in the Five Nations . After all the previous French losses to the Home Nations teams , the Scottish were favourites to win , and France 's unexpected win was considered a great occasion by the French press . It proved a reversal of the defeats , accompanied with humiliating press commentary which suggested that the French were too idle and debauched to produce a team worthy of their British opponents . 
 After unexpectedly winning the match against Scotland , France played England at Twickenham on 28 January and suffered " the most humiliating of defeats " . The Observer noted the speed of the French players , which caused the English some trouble , but there was a lack of cohesion in the midfield . The fullback , <unk> , was singled out as the best French player , whose kicking saved the French repeatedly , while in the forwards , Guillemin was especially noted for his defending . 
 On 28 February , 20 @,@ 000 spectators , a huge crowd for French rugby , turned out to watch the game against Wales . Although the Welsh went on to win 0 – 15 , with three converted tries , they were prevented from scoring in the first half . They were clearly the better team , but the French played with greater passion . Once again , while <unk> praised the French forwards , he singled out Guillemin for criticism , creating an imbalance in the French scrum . The Chronique de la Jeunesse , however , highlights Guillemin 's dribbling with the ball . Nevertheless , for the final international match of the season against Ireland , Guillemin was dropped from the team , with approval from Reichel , although he nevertheless travelled to Cork as a replacement . 
 Guillemin was selected for an international match between the best of London and the best of Paris , played at Stade de France on 12 March . Reichel disapproved of Guillemin 's selection and suggested the Parisian front row was rather weak . In the event , London won 17 – 21 in an end @-@ to @-@ end contest , in which both sides scored five tries , but London managed to convert three , while Paris only one . 
 Guillemin 's final plaudit came as part of the team that played Stade <unk> in the final of the Championnat de France , and finished runner @-@ up . Although favourites to win and leading 0 – 6 at half time , the visitors were narrowly beaten 8 – 6 .

 = Rhonda Sing = 
 Rhonda Ann Sing ( February 21 , 1961 – July 27 , 2001 ) was a Canadian professional wrestler . After training with Mildred Burke , she wrestled in Japan under the name Monster Ripper . In 1987 , she returned to Canada and began working with Stampede Wrestling , where she was their first Stampede Women 's Champion . In 1995 , she worked in the World Wrestling Federation as the comedic character Bertha Faye , winning the WWF Women 's Championship . She also wrestled in World Championship Wrestling to help generate interest in their women 's division .

 = = = Training = = = 
 While growing up in Calgary , Sing attended numerous Stampede Wrestling events with her mother . She knew she wanted to be a wrestler from a young age and frequently beat up the neighborhood children . As a teenager , Sing approached members of the Hart wrestling family and asked to be trained , but she was rejected as they did not train women wrestlers at the time . Bret Hart , however , claims it had more to do with scheduling conflicts . During a trip to Hawaii in 1978 , she saw Japanese women 's wrestling on television and decided she wanted to pursue the sport . She later wrote Mildred Burke , after a friend gave her a magazine with Burke 's contact information , and sent her a biography and photo . Shortly thereafter , she joined Burke 's training facility in Encino , California . 
 = = = Japan , Canada , and Puerto Rico ( 1979 – 1995 ) = = = 
 After a few weeks of training with Burke , Sing was scouted by All Japan Women ( AJW ) , despite her inexperience . Sing 's debut match in Japan was a tag team match with partner Mami Kumano , defeating the Beauty Pair ( Jackie Sato and Maki Ueda ) in January 1979 . In Japan , she began wrestling under the name Monster Ripper . Although she found adjusting to the Japanese culture difficult , Sing held AJW 's title on two occasions and was the first Calgary born wrestler to gain success in Japan . During her time in the company , the Japanese female wrestlers gave her a hard time because they did not like losing to foreigners . Sing also had difficulty because of her youth and inexperience in the ring . Sing , however , was comforted by New Japan Pro Wrestling 's Dynamite Kid , who had also trained in Calgary . Sing won the WWWA World Heavyweight Championship from Jackie Sato on July 31 , 1979 . Despite losing the title to Sato six weeks later , she regained it on March 15 , 1980 . The title was vacated in August 1980 . 
 After another stint in Japan , Sing returned to Stampede Wrestling in late 1987 and was renamed Rhonda Singh by Stu Hart , the owner of the company . There were plans to pair her with Gama Singh , but they never came to fruition . During 1987 , she was named their first Women 's Champion because she had defeated Wendi Richter prior to returning to Stampede . She held the title until September 22 , 1988 , when she lost to Chigusa Nagayo . 
 Over the next few years , Sing once again traveled throughout the world and wrestled for a number of companies , holding several titles . Between 1987 and 1990 , Sing worked in Puerto Rico for the World Wrestling Council ( WWC ) , where she held the WWC Women 's Championship on five separate occasions by defeating Wendi Richter , Candi Devine , and Sasha in matches for the title . . As Monster Ripper on the WWC 18th Anniversary Show ( July 6 , ' 91 ) , she faced and beat El <unk> on a woman vs man match . 
 = = = World Wrestling Federation ( 1995 – 1996 ) = = = 
 In 1995 , Sing was contacted by the World Wrestling Federation to help their fledgling women 's division . She , however , was repackaged as Bertha Faye , a comedic character who lived in a trailer park and dated Harvey Wippleman . ( in an <unk> radio interview Wippleman revealed that the two never got along well ) WWF management originally wanted her to have an on @-@ screen feud with Bull Nakano , but there was a change of plans after Nakano was charged with cocaine possession . 
 Sing made her WWF debut on the April 3 , 1995 episode of Monday Night Raw participating in a sneak attack on Alundra Blayze , making it appear as if Blayze 's nose had been broken . At SummerSlam , Faye defeated Blayze for the WWF Women 's Championship and held the title until the October 23 , 1995 airing of Monday Night Raw , where Blayze regained the title , ending Faye 's reign at only 57 days . 
 Fan interest in women 's wrestling sunk once again as the year closed , and Sing tired of working there . Moreover , Faye was frustrated with her gimmick . WWF management asked her not to perform the same power moves as the male wrestlers , so instead , Faye was forced to act as comic relief . After a year with the company , Sing asked for a release from her contract . She briefly returned to Japan , but did not like the new system , which did not guarantee payouts .

 In late 1999 , she worked with World Championship Wrestling ( WCW ) briefly , appearing on several telecasts to help generate interest in a women 's division .

 Backstage , Sing was friends with the male , rather than the female , wrestlers . During her time in the WWF , she developed a close friendship with Owen Hart . 
 After leaving WCW , Sing took a break from wrestling . In 2001 , Sing worked as a caregiver to the handicapped . On July 27 , 2001 , Sing died from a heart attack at the age of 40 . Sing never married and never had children .

 = 2007 Texas Longhorns football team = 
 The 2007 Texas Longhorn football team ( variously " Texas " or " UT " or the " Horns " ) represented the University of Texas at Austin in the 2007 NCAA Division I FBS football season . The team was coached by Mack Brown , who received the 2005 Paul " Bear " Bryant Coach of the Year award . The Longhorns play their home games in Darrell K Royal – Texas Memorial Stadium ( <unk> ) . 
 The Longhorns entered the 2007 season ranked third on all @-@ time college football lists in both total wins and winning percentage . A pre @-@ season ranking by ESPN writer Mark Schlabach had the Longhorns ranked eighth , while College Football News ranked Texas third . The Longhorns came into the season ranked fourth in both the Coaches Poll and AP Poll . During the preceding summer five players had been disciplined for legal infractions , another suspended for NCAA rule violations , and a coach had undergone surgery for cancer . Additional players were suspended during the season . 
 The Longhorns played games against two opponents they had never faced previously : Arkansas State University and the University of Central Florida ( UCF ) . The Longhorns narrowly achieved a victory in their home opener with Arkansas State , and in their first road game of the season , Texas was the inaugural opponent for the UCF Knights in their new stadium . In preseason speculation , games against Texas Christian University ( TCU ) and Oklahoma ( OU ) were considered among the top 20 games to watch during the 2007 college football season . 
 The Longhorns lost conference games to the Kansas State Wildcats , the Oklahoma Sooners , and the Texas A & M Aggies . In two close games , they avoided upset attempts by lower @-@ ranked Nebraska and Oklahoma State , the latter game involving a 21 @-@ point fourth quarter comeback by the Horns . Texas concluded its season by winning the 2007 Holiday Bowl against the Arizona State Sun Devils — another first @-@ time opponent for Texas — bringing their season record to 10 – 3 . 
 The Horns finished the season ranked tenth in the AP poll and in the USA Today coaches poll . After the season , five UT players entered professional football through the 2008 NFL Draft and four others agreed to sign free @-@ agent contracts with NFL teams . 
 = = Before the 2007 season = = 
 Mack Brown became the head coach of the Texas Longhorns for the 1998 season . Through 2006 , he had a win / loss record of 93 – 22 and the best winning percentage ( 80 @.@ 9 % ) of any football coach in Longhorn history . The 2004 team had the first Bowl Championship Series win for any Texas team and the 2005 team won the National Championship ( the fourth for the UT football program ) . 
 The 2006 team had 9 wins and 1 loss through November 4 , 2006 but starting quarterback Colt McCoy was injured in the 11th game and Texas lost the final two regular season games in 2006 , including a 12 – 7 home loss to division rivals Texas A & M. This took the team out of contention for the conference championship , as well as the national championship . 
 Between the 2006 regular season and the bowl season , back @-@ up quarterback Jevan Snead transferred to another school , and Longhorn defensive coordinator Gene Chizik accepted the head @-@ coaching job at Iowa State University . The Longhorns ended up accepting a bowl invitation to the Alamo Bowl against the unranked University of Iowa Hawkeyes , who had finished in eighth place in the Big Ten Conference . Colt McCoy was cleared to play for the Horns and led Texas through a back @-@ and @-@ forth affair to a 26 – 24 win . The Longhorns finished the season with a record of 10 wins and 3 losses and received a final ranking of 13th in the nation by both the Associated Press AP Poll and the USA Today Coaches Poll 
 Texas entered the 2007 season ranked third in the all @-@ time list of both total wins and winning percentage . They were ranked in the Top 10 by numerous pre @-@ season polls . For instance , a pre @-@ season ranking by ESPN writer Mark Schlabach had the Longhorns ranked eighth ; Rivals.com ranked them ninth ; College Football News and Real Football 365 both ranked Texas third . The Longhorns came into the season ranked fourth in both the Coaches Poll and AP Poll .

 Following the final home game of 2006 , construction workers demolished the north end of Darrell K. Royal @-@ Texas Memorial Stadium . This section was rebuilt to make the lowest seats closer to the field while planning for luxury boxes and an upper @-@ deck . The lower deck was ready for 2007 , while the upper deck and luxury boxes are planned to be ready for 2008 . The modifications put the north end zone seats thirty yards closer to the field of play . This results in several game day changes , such as Smokey the Cannon moving to the south end @-@ zone near Bevo . 
 Each 2007 Longhorn football helmet featured a Texas <unk> decal . The decal was chosen to honor President Lyndon B. Johnson , Lady Bird Johnson and the Johnson family . Brown said President Johnson used to enjoy discussing football with former UT coach Darrell K. Royal , while the first lady was known for her conservation efforts , particularly the spread of native wildflowers . 
 For the second straight year , UT merchandise products were the top @-@ selling products among clients of Collegiate Licensing Company .

 The Longhorns played their 2007 Spring Jamboree <unk> on March 31 , 2007 and reported for fall practice on August 5 , 2007 . A public scrimmage scheduled for August 18 , 2007 was canceled due to safety concerns related to the weather and to ongoing stadium construction . With rain expected over the weekend and no working pumps to help remove water from the field , Brown held a closed practice indoors instead . 
 During fall practice , receivers Limas Sweed , Billy Pittman , and Jordan Shipley were injured . Sweed suffered a sprain to his left wrist on August 15 . Pittman sprained his left shoulder during practice on August 17 . Head UT athletic trainer Kenny Boyd said , " We will continue to evaluate [ Pittman ] and monitor his progress in hopes of getting him back in time for the season opener . " Jordan Shipley had to limit his practice due to a strained hamstring . The receiver position was considered one of the deepest positions on the team ; coaches said veteran players Quan Cosby ( Texas ' second @-@ leading receiver ) and Nate Jones performed well in training camp . Coach Brown said he expected to be able to play three freshman receivers in 2007 : Brandon Collins , Malcolm Williams and James <unk> . On August 29 , 2006 Brown announced that Sweed was " probable " for the season opening game , but that Shipley was " doubtful " .

 Prior to the first game of the season , the University of Texas Board of Regents voted unanimously to raise Brown 's salary by $ 300 @,@ 000 , bringing his annual compensation to $ 2 @.@ 81 million and keeping him among the five highest @-@ paid coaches in college football . The package also includes up to $ 3 million in bonuses , including " $ 100 @,@ 000 if he wins the Big 12 Championship and $ 450 @,@ 000 for a national championship , as well as bonuses based on the percent of players who graduate . " At the time , Brown 's contract extended through the 2016 season and included buy @-@ out clauses should another school attempt to hire Brown . 
 Greg Davis , who entered his 10th season with Texas , was the team 's offensive coordinator and quarterbacks coach . Duane Akina was the defensive coordinator , and took the position vacated by Gene Chizik when he left the program . During the 2007 season , Akina performed his job on the sidelines while Larry Mac Duff provided input from the press box . UT running backs coach Ken Rucker announced in August that he had prostate cancer and that he would have surgery on August 27 . He coached practices until just prior to surgery and returned to the team before the end of the season . Rucker 's health concern coincided with player incidents that created Brown 's most tumultuous off @-@ season since arriving at Texas .

 The first Longhorn game of the season marked the first @-@ ever meeting between Texas and Arkansas State , a NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision team from the Sun Belt Conference . Pre @-@ game media attention played upon the fact that both schools won national football championships in 1970 . Both schools entered the game with a level of controversy attached to their teams . Arkansas State was facing criticism over its team name . The team was nicknamed " Indians " in honor of the Osage Nation that inhabited the area until the 1800s . The NCAA enforced restrictions on the use of Indian mascots , saying that they were derogatory to American Indians . In 2008 , the Indians changed their name to the Red Wolves . The University of Texas was dealing with player suspensions , and passed a large pay raise for Mack Brown one week prior to the game . As part of the package , Brown received a $ 100 @,@ 000 special payment upon completion of the game . 
 Two days prior to the game , Las Vegas casinos favored Texas by 39 points . Sportswriters John Bridges and Kirk <unk> of the Austin American @-@ Statesman predicted the Longhorns would have a big lead early in the game and that true @-@ freshman quarterback John Chiles would enter the game in the second or third quarter as the back @-@ up to Colt McCoy . Redshirt freshman quarterback Sherrod Harris was on the injured list and was not expected to play . Those predictions were off the mark as the Indians almost kept up with the Horns and McCoy stayed in for the entire game . 
 Texas scored a touchdown on its first possession and Arkansas State answered with a field goal . Texas made another touchdown to end the first quarter . Neither team scored in the second quarter . Texas scored seven points in the third quarter , while Arkansas State was scoreless . In the fourth quarter , Arkansas State scored ten points to pull within eight points of Texas . With approximately one minute left to play , Arkansas State attempted an onside kick . State recovered the ball , but a controversial illegal formation penalty forced them to re @-@ kick . On the re @-@ kick , Texas recovered the ball and was able to run out the clock to preserve a 21 – 13 win . Colt McCoy threw two touchdown passes and two interceptions ; he also made two punts . Jamaal Charles accounted for the third touchdown . 
 Starting Longhorn defensive end Brian Orakpo injured his right knee during the game . The team reported Orakpo would not need surgery but that it was uncertain when he would return . 
 Kirk <unk> was among commentators who were unimpressed by the Longhorns performance , saying , " if this becomes the pattern , look for a 7 – 5 season . " On September 5 , Arkansas State coach Steve Roberts said he was told by the Big 12 Conference 's supervisor of football officials that game officials wrongly overturned ASU 's recovery of the onside kick . He said the Big 12 Conference Supervisor of Officials told Arkansas State there had been no illegal formation , that no penalty should have been called , and that Arkansas State should have been awarded possession of the football . A Big 12 Conference spokesman said he could not confirm or deny that such a conversation took place and that any such conversation would be confidential . 
 = = = TCU = = = 
 The second Longhorn game of the season was the first meeting of the former Southwest Conference ( <unk> ) rivals since the conference disbanded following the 1995 season . Texas held a 60 – 20 – 1 ( win @-@ lose @-@ tie ) record vs. the TCU Horned Frogs . Their most recent meeting was a 27 – 19 Longhorn victory . 
 In their annual season preview magazine , CBS <unk> selected two Longhorn games — vs. TCU and against OU — as ranking in their 17 “ must see ” games for 2007 . CBS Sportsline.com also selected TCU as one of the potential “ BCS Busters ” for 2007 , saying , “ The Horned Frogs will have one of the best defenses in the nation with nine starters back on a squad that allowed only 12 @.@ 3 points per game last year , including a 12 – 3 victory over Texas Tech . Garry Patterson has made the Horned Frogs one of the best non @-@ BCS schools in the nation , but unlike Utah and Boise State , they had not received the opportunity to play in a Bowl Championship Series bowl . If TCU can get past Texas on Sept . 8 , it might finally be time for the Horned Frogs to invade the BCS party . ” 
 Texas ' narrow win versus Arkansas State in week one , together with TCU 's victory over Baylor , fueled speculation that the 2007 Horned Frogs might have a chance at an upset victory over the Longhorns . Texas dropped three places to number seven in the AP Poll and the Coaches Poll , while TCU moved up three places to number nineteen . One day prior to the game , Las Vegas casinos picked Texas to win by 9 ½ points . 
 Both teams were scoreless in the first quarter . In the second quarter , TCU 's Torrey Stewart faked a blitz , then dropped back and caught an interception from Colt McCoy before running in for a touchdown . Later in the quarter , McCoy threw a pass that was tipped by a defender and intercepted by David Roach . The Longhorn defense kept the Horned Frogs out of the end zone following the interception , but the Frogs scored on a 19 @-@ yard field goal by Chris Manfredini . The first half ended with TCU leading , 10 – 0 . 
 The Longhorns ' first second @-@ half drive culminated in a 33 @-@ yard touchdown pass to Nate Jones . A fumble by TCU gave Texas good field position , but the Longhorns were stopped on the two @-@ yard line and settled for a game @-@ tying field goal . The Horns held TCU to seventeen yards of offense and no first downs in the quarter . 
 In the fourth quarter , Colt McCoy set up the go @-@ ahead score with a scramble to the TCU one @-@ yard line . Vondrell McGee scored a touchdown two plays later . Texas ' next possession resulted in a second field goal by Ryan Bailey . The Longhorn defense held TCU to a three @-@ and @-@ out but TCU 's punter fumbled the ball , and Brandon Foster ran the ball in for a touchdown , capping 27 straight points for Texas . The Frogs came back and scored 37 @-@ yard field goal by Manfredini and then attempted an <unk> kick but Texas recovered the ball . UT 's Jamaal Charles made a 39 @-@ yard rushing touchdown for the game 's final score . Texas won , 34 – 13 .

 The third game of the season was the first @-@ ever meeting between the Longhorns and the UCF Knights . Texas was the first opponent in the Knights ' new stadium , Bright House Networks Stadium , and the game was the first of three scheduled meetings between the schools . The Knights opened their season with an upset of North Carolina State ; the victory was their second victory over a BCS opponent and the first time for the Knights to beat a BCS school since 2000 . They followed the win with a week off , giving them two weeks to prepare for Texas . It was just the sixth time Texas had played in Florida and was the team 's first appearance in the state since 1965 . The number six @-@ ranked Longhorns were the highest rank team the Knights had ever played . UCF coach George O 'Leary said prior to the game , " When you talk about elite teams , Texas is an elite team from an athletics , traditions and overall standpoint . " 
 Several Longhorn players missed the game due to injuries or suspensions . Starting defensive end Brian Orakpo missed his second straight game as a result of suffering a knee sprain against Arkansas State . Starting offensive tackle Adam <unk> was listed as doubtful . Backup quarterback Sherrod Harris was also injured and had not seen action since spraining his knee on August 12 . Wide receiver Jordan Shipley participated in his first game since a preseason injury . Defensive end Henry Melton , linebacker Sergio Kindle and receiver Billy Pittman were serving the last game of their three @-@ game suspensions . On September 13 , Tyrell Gatewood joined Andre Jones and Robert Joseph in receiving an indefinite suspension due to alleged illegal activities . The day prior to the game , sports books in Las Vegas picked Texas to win by 18 points . 
 A sell @-@ out crowd greeted the Longhorns in Florida . UCF received the opening kickoff in their end @-@ zone and took a touchback . UCF was not able to get a first down and before punting the ball to Texas . The Horns drove inside the UCF 20 @-@ yard line before being stopped on fourth @-@ and @-@ short and settling for a field goal . On their second possession , the Knights drove the ball down the field for a touchdown and a four point lead . Shortly thereafter , lightning was spotted near the stadium and both teams were sent into their locker rooms for approximately 15 minutes before play resumed . Texas ' first drive after the delay culminated in a six @-@ yard touchdown pass to Nate Jones . When the first quarter ended , the Longhorns had a three point lead and the Knights had the ball . In the second quarter , the Longhorns and the Knights each fumbled inside the UCF ten @-@ yard line . Texas scored ten points in the quarter to UCF 's three . The score at halftime was 20 – 10 , Texas . 
 Texas began the scoring in the third quarter with a 49 @-@ yard field goal . UCF needed just five plays to reply with a touchdown and cut Texas ' lead to 23 – 17 . After two punts by the Horns and one by the Knights , UCF turned the ball over on downs . On the next play , McCoy threw an interception and UCF 's resulting drive culminated in a touchdown to give the Knights a 24 – 23 lead with 13 : 38 left in the game . The Longhorns regained the lead with two field goals and a touchdown . A Longhorn attempt at a two @-@ point conversion failed , making the score 35 – 24 . This decision was later criticized by commentators who said that the decision allowed UCF a chance to tie the game . 
 With 2 : 14 remaining , Longhorn Jamaal Charles committed his second fumble of the game . UCF recovered the ball and completed a touchdown and a two @-@ point conversion to cut Texas ' lead to 35 – 32 with 35 seconds remaining . When the Knights were unable to recover their onside kick attempt , Texas was able to run out the clock and preserve a three @-@ point victory . 
 Jamaal Charles of Texas rushed 22 times for 157 yards and Kevin Smith of UCF rushed 27 times for 150 yards for UCF . McCoy completed 68 % of his passes for a total of 227 yards ; UCF 's Kyle Israel completed 35 % of his passes for a total of 133 yards . McCoy 's 47 passing attempts tied a UT single @-@ game record . His 32 completions set a new school record , besting the 30 completed by Vince Young during the 2006 Rose Bowl and by Major Applewhite during two 1999 games . Due to his performance in the game , Texas cornerback Brandon Foster was named the Big 12 ’ s defensive player of the week . For the second week in a row , Foster scored a touchdown on defense . Foster was recognized by the conference the previous week for his work on special teams , making him the first Longhorn to get back @-@ to @-@ back conference honors since running back Hodges Mitchell in 2000 .

The Longhorns suspended special teams player James Henry prior to the game , but three Longhorn players — Billy Pittman , Henry Melton , and Sergio Kindle — were able to rejoin the team after serving three game suspensions . Brian Orakpo missed his third straight game due to an injury received in the season @-@ opening game . The Owls came into the game 0 – 3 after losing the previous week to Texas Tech by a score of 59 – 24 . 
 The Longhorns started the game on offense and had no success on their first drive . On the first play , Colt McCoy threw an incompletion , and on the second play , Jamaal Charles fumbled the ball to the Owls . The Texas defense held Rice to a field goal attempt , which was no good . Texas scored a touchdown on a 13 @-@ play drive that included converting a 4th @-@ and @-@ two situation . The Longhorns extended their lead to 41 – 0 before Rice scored a touchdown with 18 seconds left in the first half . In the second half , Texas scored two touchdowns and one field goal , and Rice scored one touchdown . Texas won 58 – 14 . 
 McCoy completed 20 of his 29 passing attempts , accumulating 333 yards through the air . For the first time in the season , he did not throw an interception . McCoy and most of the Longhorn starting players were replaced by backups after the first drive of the second half . True freshman quarterback John Chiles made his first appearance as a Texas player in the first quarter , when he participated in a single play . He came out of the game after the play before returning in the third quarter as McCoy 's replacement . On his first drive , Chiles led the Longhorns 80 yards to a touchdown , carrying the ball 4 times for 49 yards . He also threw one incomplete pass ( one of two he threw in the game ) and handed off to Vondrell McGee three times for thirty @-@ one yards . Redshirt freshman Sherrod Harris replaced Chiles for the final two drives of the game . Chiles ' strong performance immediately led to media speculation as to how the Longhorns could get him more playing time . 
 McGee was the game 's leading rusher , and had 8 carries for 80 yards . Jamaal Charles rushed 14 times for 72 yards , and John Chiles ran 9 times for 72 yards . Limas Sweed was the leading receiver with 5 catches for 139 yards and 2 touchdowns as he set a new career high for receiving yards in a single game . Sergio Kindle injured his knee , and defensive end Eddie Jones injured his shoulder , but neither injury was thought to be serious . 
 = = = Kansas State = = = 
 Texas first played Kansas State in 1913 and held a record of 5 – 4 – 0 in the series prior to 2007 . Since the Kansas State Wildcats belong to the north division of the Big 12 Conference , Texas plays KSU two out of every four years . In the 2006 meeting , fourth @-@ ranked Texas was favored by 16 points over an unranked Kansas State team ; Colt McCoy was injured early in the game and KSU went on to defeat Texas 45 – 42 . This defeat snapped the Longhorns 17 win streak on the road as well as the national @-@ best 21 @-@ game conference winning steak . 
 One day prior to the 2007 game , Las Vegas casinos picked Texas to win by 15 points . Kansas State got the ball to start the game and scored a touchdown on their opening drive . Texas answered with a touchdown on a drive that featured backup quarterback John Chiles in the game alongside Colt McCoy for some of the plays . The first quarter ended with the score tied 7 – 7 . 
 In the second quarter , Kansas State took a 24 – 14 lead and Colt McCoy was injured and headed to the locker room just before halftime . McCoy came back as the Longhorn quarterback at the start of the third quarter , but Texas was never able to erase the point deficit and lost , 41 – 21 . With about two minutes left in the game , McCoy again headed to the locker room early and Chiles led the Longhorns ' last drive . 
 McCoy threw for 200 yards and had four interceptions during his worst performance of his college career . Sports Illustrated selected him as one of the season 's 10 " Most Disappointing College Players " and noted that his nine interceptions thrown to that point in 2007 were already two more than he threw during the entire 2006 season . Kansas State had no turnovers and scored 21 points on defense and special teams . The Wildcats scored one touchdown on a punt return , one on a kick return , and one on an interception . Previously , Texas had never allowed all three types of scores in a single season . The 41 points were the most scored against Texas in Austin since UCLA handed the Longhorns a 66 – 3 loss in 1997 . The loss to Kansas State was the worst home defeat in the Mack Brown era at Texas . Stewart Mandel of Sports Illustrated listed several factors that contributed to the Longhorns ' struggles . He cited the off @-@ field problems as evidence that no UT player has been able to show the superior leadership skills of Vince Young . Mandel said that McCoy , still only a sophomore , had not been able to completely fill that gap and that McCoy 's play had not been as good as during 2006 . He also said part of the blame should be placed on an offensive line that lost several starters and had not been able to consistently protect McCoy . Finally , he noted that the running game had been " equally inconsistent " . The win over UT was the Wildcats ' first road victory over a top – ten team in school history . 
 = = = Oklahoma = = = 
 The game against the 2007 Oklahoma Sooners football team marked the 102nd meeting of the Red River Shootout , which has been called one of the greatest sports rivalries in college football . It is Texas ' second @-@ longest running rivalry , just behind its rivalry with Texas A & M. Prior to 2007 , Texas led the series 57 – 39 – 5 , including the last two consecutive wins . The last match @-@ up was a 28 – 10 Longhorn victory . Since 1929 , the game has been held at the Cotton Bowl in Dallas , Texas typically in mid @-@ October with the State Fair of Texas occurring adjacent to the stadium . 
 CBS Sportsline.com listed the game sixth on its list of games to watch during the 2007 season , saying , “ The annual Red River Shootout in Dallas will once again feature two top @-@ ten teams with the winner being the front @-@ runner for not only a Big 12 title but a factor in the national title picture . The game will also feature one of the best match @-@ ups of the year with Limas Sweed and Billy Pittman of the Longhorns facing against Oklahoma ’ s excellent secondary . ” Like Texas , Oklahoma suffered a defeat one week before the Red River Shootout , losing to the Colorado Buffaloes . Texas ' loss pushed it to number 16 in the coaches poll and number 19 in the AP poll ; OU fell to number 10 in both polls . The ranking marked Texas ' 114th straight week to be listed in the AP poll , the longest active streak in the country and tying the school record . The Longhorns had been ranked 142 straight weeks in the coaches poll , the longest UT streak in any poll and the country 's longest active streak in the coaches poll . On the morning of the Red River Shootout , oddsmakers favored Oklahoma to win by 12 – 13 points . 
 The game was a back @-@ and @-@ forth affair ultimately won by Oklahoma , 28 – 21 . OU 's freshman quarterback , Sam Bradford , was 21 – of – 32 for 244 yards and 3 touchdowns . UT 's McCoy was 19 – of – 26 for 324 yards and two touchdowns , earning the most passing yardage against an Oklahoma team since the 2004 @-@ season National Championship Game vs. USC . McCoy threw one interception , and Jamaal Charles lost a fumble inside the Oklahoma five yard @-@ line . For the second straight week , the Texas defense did not cause any turnovers . 
 McCoy , who suffered a concussion the previous week , played the game with his throwing arm bandaged from mid @-@ forearm to biceps and took four sacks and a blind @-@ side late hit after one play had been whistled dead . With the loss , Texas opened conference play 0 – 2 for the first time since 1956 . A bright spot for the Horns was tight end Jermichael Finley , who caught four passes for 149 yards . Jamaal Charles ran for 79 yards and John Chiles carried once for four yards . Counting the sacks to McCoy , Texas had a total of 61 yards rushing . 
 Receiver Limas Sweed left the game early because he re @-@ injured his left wrist . He later had surgery to tighten the ligaments in the wrist but the injury ended his collegiate career . The Austin American @-@ Statesman reported " Quan Cosby likely will move to Sweed 's spot at split end , with Nate Jones moving to flanker . The Longhorns likely will decide between Billy Pittman and Jordan Shipley at slot receiver when Texas is in its base , three @-@ receiver set . " 
 Defensive end Aaron Lewis fractured his elbow in the game and was taken out of the lineup indefinitely . The Austin American @-@ Statesman reported " A depth chart issued Monday shows Lamarr Houston moving to Lewis ' spot at power end , with Brian Orakpo regaining his starting job at quick end . The Longhorns have been dealing with injuries at defensive end all season . " Fullback Luke Tiemann also required surgery to repair a broken wrist , but was expected to miss only two games . 
 Jeff Duarte of the Houston Chronicle made note of Charles ' fumble , McCoy 's interception and the low rushing yardage . He said , " the Texas Longhorns went back and forth with Oklahoma for most of the game Saturday before eventually succumbing to the same problems that have taken them from a Top 10 ranking to the verge of dropping out of the national polls for the first time in seven years . " The win kept the Sooners in position to win the south division of the <unk> Conference and could even allow them back into the national championship race . 
 Asked to assess his personal performance after the loss to Kansas State , Colt McCoy said , " I think I 've had some bad luck , I 'm definitely a better quarterback , definitely more experienced — I 've just had some bad luck . Things that can go the wrong way , have gone the wrong way — tipped balls and that stuff . " He also said there was room for improvement , " Teams are blitzing us a lot more . We 've handled it well for the most part , but there 's so many things we can do better ... If you ask every person on this offense , they 'll tell you there 's something individually they can do better . " After the loss to Oklahoma , Mack Brown said he did not want to hear about bad luck , " By saying we 're unlucky is just a cop @-@ out , this game isn 't about luck . If you knock balls loose you should get on them . If you tip balls in the air you should catch them . We 're not going to have any excuses . " Brown cited the lack of big plays on defense , particularly the lack of forced turnovers , as a problem for Texas . Both Brown and Greg Davis hinted that Jamaal Charles could face less playing time as a result of his problems hanging onto the ball . 
 = = = Iowa State = = = 
 Texas first played Iowa State in 1979 , and the Longhorns had won all six matchups coming into the 2007 season . Their last meeting in 2006 concluded with a 37 – 14 Texas victory . The Cyclones football team was coached by Gene Chizik who was co @-@ defensive coordinator for Texas from 2005 – 2006 . Like Texas , the Cyclones were 0 – 2 in conference play , but they had only a 1 – 5 record overall . Their lone victory of the season had been against Iowa when they made a game @-@ winning 28 @-@ yard field goal with : 01 remaining . As with Kansas State , Texas plays the Cyclones two out of every four years as part of the Big 12 Conference schedule . 
 Despite losses to Kansas State and Oklahoma , Texas remained in the Top 25 coming into the game with Iowa State . The Horns were number 22 in the USA Today coaches poll and number 23 in the Associated Press media poll . Texas extended its streak in the coaches poll to 143 weeks and its streak in the AP poll to 115 weeks . Mack Brown said that he would not change the game plan in facing Chizik but that he would need to adjust sideline signals and snap counts since they were known to the former Texas co @-@ coordinator . 
 The Austin American @-@ Statesman predicted Iowa State 's quarterback Bret Meyer and wide receiver Todd Blythe would pose the biggest threat for the Longhorns . The paper also called the Cyclones the worst team in the <unk> north and predicted that Texas would be 2 – 2 in conference play after facing Iowa State and Baylor , the worst team in the south division . The Daily Texan reported that the game offered an opportunity for Gene Chizik to get a " signature win " if his team could beat Texas . Two days prior to the game , oddsmakers favored Texas to win by 16 points . 
 The Longhorns were in control from the beginning and routed Iowa State 56 – 3 , the worst loss for the Cyclones since 1997 . Iowa State got the ball to start the game and made a first down with a pass from Bret Meyer to Todd Blythe . The UT defense prevented them from gaining another first down and the Cyclones punted from their own 37 yard @-@ line ; Texas took over at their 42 yard @-@ line . On the first play from scrimmage , Colt McCoy scrambled away from a blitz and saw that Jordan Shipley had broken off his route and was 10 yards behind any Cyclone defender . Shipley caught the pass from McCoy and sped away from the Cyclones to score a 58 yard touchdown . From that point , the Longhorns never relinquished the lead . They led 14 – 3 at the end of the first quarter and 28 – 3 at halftime . In the second half , Texas added another 28 – points , en route to a 56 – 3 blowout . 
 The Longhorns ' success passing the ball eventually gave way to the running game . John Chiles led the Longhorns with 54 yards on 9 carries . McCoy rushed for 50 yards , while Jamaal Charles carried the ball 7 times for 44 yards . The Longhorns finished with 514 total yards – 298 via the air , 216 on the ground . The Longhorns forced three turnovers , including two interceptions , without surrendering any themselves . Brandon Foster intercepted a pass from Bret Meyer and returned it for a 39 yard touchdown . Deon Beasley also picked off Meyer , who completed only 17 passes for 111 yards and no touchdowns . 
 Texas fullback Antwan Cobb sprained his left anterior cruciate ligament late in the game , an injury that sidelined him for the rest of the season . Cobb 's injury left the Longhorns without a true fullback , although they had not utilized the position often during the season . The only other fullback on the team , Luke Tiemann , was expected to miss one more week with a wrist injury . Mack Brown said Chris <unk> , the second @-@ team tailback , would move to fullback for the Baylor game . Freshman tight end Blaine Irby had taken some practice at fullback and could also be used in that position . Robert Killebrew was benched after committing two personal foul penalties , a consistent problem for him in the 2007 season . Without a veteran fullback , Texas planned to either run the ball out of the shotgun formation or simply focus on the passing game . 
 Representatives from the Holiday Bowl were in attendance . According to the Austin Statesman , one of them said , " We ’ d love to have Texas , but they ’ re still hoping to wind up at the Fiesta Bowl . " In order to reach the Fiesta Bowl , Texas needed Oklahoma to lose two games , giving Texas a spot in the Big 12 Conference Championship game , which Texas would then have to win . Another possibility would have been Oklahoma making it to the National Championship game and Texas being selected for an at @-@ large Bowl Championship Series bid . " 
 = = = Baylor = = = 
 The game against Baylor was played in Floyd Casey Stadium in Waco , Texas , approximately 100 miles ( 161 km ) north on Interstate 35 from Austin , the home of the University of Texas . Because home UT games are usually a sell @-@ out , Texas games at Baylor have found numerous Texas fans driving to Waco to watch the game .

In the 96 meetings through 2006 , Texas ' record against the Bears was 70 wins , 22 losses , and 4 ties .

He was suspended indefinitely from the program . Baylor 's starting quarterback , Blake Szymanski , was questionable for the game because of a mild concussion he suffered in a game against Kansas . Although Szymanski had been physically cleared to play , back @-@ up quarterbacks Michael Machen and John David Weed were sharing snaps in practice and Baylor coaches said any one of them could get the start against Texas . Two days prior to the game , oddsmakers favored Texas to win by 25 points . 
 The game was initially a close @-@ fought contest ; Texas led by only a touchdown before Deon Beasley intercepted a pass at the Baylor 43 @-@ yard line with nine minutes remaining in the game .

John Chiles came in at quarterback ; his one play , a zone @-@ read handoff to Jamaal Charles , produced 24 yards . According to the Associated Press recap of the game , “ suddenly Texas had figured out how to beat a Cornhuskers ' team that had been steamrolled on the ground in recent weeks . Texas only threw three passes in the fourth quarter . ” 
 Once Texas switched to the zone read offense , they quickly started gaining yards and points . Charles ran for a career @-@ high 290 yards , including 216 yards and three long touchdown runs in the fourth quarter .

ESPN remarked , " For the second straight week , Jammal Charles led a late charge for the 15th @-@ ranked Longhorns .

 = = = Texas Tech = = = 
 Texas ' rivalry with the Texas Tech Red Raiders began in 1928 and through 2006 , the Longhorns were 42 – 14 – 0 against Tech .

Pre @-@ game speculation continued about what bowl game might select Texas . Various media predictions included the Gator Bowl , Cotton Bowl Classic , and Holiday Bowl . Holiday Bowl executive director Bruce <unk> said his bowl would be very interested in pitting Texas against the USC Trojans , whom Texas defeated in the 2006 Rose Bowl . A BCS bowl was also still mentioned as a possibility , with Sports Illustrated saying the Orange Bowl could take Texas . 
 Texas Center Dallas Griffin injured his anterior cruciate ligament against Oklahoma State and was out for the season . Griffin was a senior , meaning his career with the Longhorns ended due to the injury . Backup defensive end Eddie Jones and reserve safety Drew Kelson were also out for the game against Texas Tech . Linebackers Jared Norton and Sergio Kindle were listed as " questionable " and " probable " , respectively . 
 The Red Raiders were 7 – 3 on the season and 3 – 3 in the Big 12 after beating Baylor 37 – 7 in their most recent game . Quarterback Graham Harrell passed for over 4 @,@ 000 yards for the second season in a row , becoming the fifth quarterback in NCAA Division I @-@ FBS ( formerly Division I @-@ A ) to have multiple 4 @,@ 000 @-@ yard seasons . The Austin American @-@ Statesman reported , " Defensively , Texas must hope that the injured are quick healers because it 's a given that the Longhorns will need every available body against the Red Raiders . Texas Tech fields the most dynamic passing offense in the country , and the Red Raiders also stay on the field an average of 77 @.@ 3 plays per game . Tech further frustrates a defense by often going for fourth downs . They 've been successful on 14 of 23 fourth @-@ down attempts this season . A year ago , Tech was one of three on fourth downs in a 35 @-@ 31 loss to Texas . " 
 With the game falling on Veterans Day weekend , a pre @-@ game ceremony honored veterans and commemorated the 60th year of Texas ' ROTC program . Four army helicopters from Fort Hood overflew the stadium after the national anthem . It was also Senior Day for Texas , with 25 players making their last home game appearance .

Tech attempted two onside kicks in an effort to come from behind , but Texas recovered both kicks . 
 During his post @-@ game press conference , Texas Tech head coach Mike Leach excoriated the officiating crew for incompetence and bias . He speculated that the officials may have favored Texas because the head official lived in Austin , because the officials were incompetent , or because the conference wanted Texas to appear in a BCS bowl because of the increased appearance fees that such a bowl generates for the conference . Jim <unk> of the Associated Press wrote " Leach was upset officials disallowed two Tech touchdowns in the third quarter . The first was overruled when video replay clearly showed the receiver let the ball hit the ground . On the next play , a touchdown pass was negated by a holding penalty . Leach also wanted , but didn 't get , a flag for roughing the quarterback . " The Lubbock Avalanche @-@ Journal reported , " Big 12 policy prohibits coaches from commenting publicly about game officials , so Leach ’ s actions leave him open to reprimand , fine or worse . " ESPN reported , " Leach 's rant will likely draw a fine from the league and possibly a suspension . " The Big 12 fined Leach $ 10 @,@ 000 , the largest fine in conference history . 
 The win ensured that 2007 would be the 10th straight season the Longhorns won nine or more games , a record streak for the Horns . Including Mack Brown 's final two seasons at North Carolina , Brown became the only coach in the nation to lead his program to nine or more victories in 12 straight seasons .

The Aggies lost seven yards over the next three plays and were forced again to punt . The Longhorns drove 73 yards from their own 27 , converted two fourth downs , and scored a touchdown . Ryan Bailey missed the extra point , but left the Longhorns only down by eight points . The Aggies took possession on their own 33 and ran the clock out to win the game , 38 – 30 . 
 During the postgame celebration , ABC commentator Jack Arute asked Dennis Franchione whether he would return to the team the following year . Coach Franchione responded by asking the announcer to let the players enjoy their victory . At the beginning of the subsequent press conference , Coach Franchione announced his resignation , effective immediately . Shortly thereafter , Texas A & M announced defensive coordinator Gary Darnell would lead the Aggies in their bowl game . 
 = = = Holiday Bowl = = = 
 The Longhorns concluded the season in the 2007 Holiday Bowl on December 27 against the Arizona State Sun Devils . 
 With the loss to Texas A & M , the Longhorns fell out of contention for a Bowl Championship Series game ; their bowl situation would be decided largely by the play of other Big 12 teams . Number four Missouri beat number two Kansas to win the Big 12 North Division . Missouri rose to the top spot in the BCS rankings prior to facing Oklahoma in the Big 12 Championship game . Oklahoma won the game to become the Big 12 Conference champion and secure a berth in the 2008 Fiesta Bowl . Even though Missouri defeated Kansas , won their division , and outranked Kansas in the BCS standings ( sixth compared to eighth ) the Orange Bowl selected Kansas instead of Missouri to play in the 2008 Orange Bowl . The Tigers were invited to play in the 2008 Cotton Bowl Classic ; the Cotton Bowl Classic had first pick of Big 12 teams after BCS bowls have made their selections . The Holiday Bowl had the next selection and chose Texas . 
 Arizona State University was ranked number 11 in the BCS standings ; they completed a 10 – 2 regular season and won a share of the Pac @-@ 10 Conference Championship . The Sun Devils finished the regular season ranked number 11 in the final BCS rankings , number 11 in Coaches poll and number 12 in the AP rankings while Texas was number 19 in the BCS and number 17 in both the coaches and AP rankings . The Sun Devils were eligible for a BCS bowl themselves , but like Missouri , ASU was left out of the BCS selections . 
 Texas dominated the first quarter and set two Holiday Bowl records . The Longhorns ' first score , a two @-@ yard pass from Colt McCoy to nose tackle Derek Lokey , was the quickest in game history , and took place with 13 : 39 remaining in the first quarter . The Longhorns scored 21 points in the first quarter — two more than previous record @-@ holder SMU scored against BYU in 1980 . Texas ’ defense forced two turnovers and held the Sun Devils scoreless for the period . 
 The game included one of the most bizarre plays of the football season . ASU ’ s Rudy Carpenter fumbled the ball as ASU was close to scoring a touchdown . Chris Jessee , a member of the Longhorns football operations staff and Mack Brown ’ s stepson , stepped onto the field and may or may not have touched the ball as it bounced near the sideline . The ball was recovered by Texas , seemingly preventing an ASU touchdown . However , after a twelve ‑ minute review , the officials awarded the ball to Arizona State ; the Sun Devils scored a touchdown on the next play . 
 The Longhorns won the game , 52 – 34 . The 52 points were the most ever scored by the Longhorns in a bowl game . Joseph Duarte of the Houston Chronicle called the Holiday Bowl the " biggest victory of the season in what could serve as a springboard for a preseason Top 10 ranking next season . " 
 = = After the season = = 
 Two Longhorns were named to postseason All @-@ American lists . Marcus Griffin was selected to the ESPN list and Tony Hills was selected by the Walter Camp Football Foundation . 
 Towards the end of the season , speculation intensified about which players might enter professional football though the 2008 NFL Draft . In November , Jamaal Charles said he would return for his senior season rather than enter professional football in the NFL . In December , sources reported Charles and Jermichael Finley had filed paperwork with the NFL to evaluate their draft potential if they decided to enter professional football in the NFL Draft instead of returning for their senior season . Quan Cosby , who spent three years in professional baseball , was reported to be still deciding whether to file the paperwork . Defensive tackle Roy Miller said he would definitely be back for his senior season . Mack Brown did not comment about specific players but said , " We always try to help our guys get as much information as possible when it comes to the NFL . We encourage and help them go through the process ... All of our underclassmen have told us they will be coming back , but if you 're playing well enough to be considered an NFL prospect , going through the process can only help you better understand it and realize what you need to work on to improve your status . " Charles said he would not go pro unless he was predicted to be chosen in the first round of the draft . After the Holiday Bowl Charles said , " Right now , I ’ m probably coming back . I didn ’ t think I did that good in the game . Next year maybe I ’ ll be up for the Heisman . I will come back . " From 2000 – 2007 , the Longhorns have had seven players taken in the first 10 picks of the NFL draft , more than any other school . 
 On January 2 , 2008 , Charles announced that he was rescinding his earlier decision and would leave Texas for the NFL . Despite skipping his senior year , Charles ranks fourth on the list of total rushing yards by a UT player , behind Ricky Williams , Cedric Benson , and Earl Campbell , with 3 @,@ 328 yards . Williams and Campbell each won the Heisman Trophy in their senior seasons . With Charles ' departure , quarterback Colt McCoy becomes the leading returning rusher for the Longhorns . Tight end Jermichael Finley also declared he would forgo his senior season to enter the NFL . 
 The draft concluded with five Longhorns selected : Limas Sweed ( 53rd pick ) , Jamaal Charles ( 73rd ) , Jermichael Finley ( 91st ) , Tony Hills ( 130th ) , and Frank Okam ( 151st ) . In addition , Brandon Foster , Marcus Griffin , Nate Jones and Derek Lokey agreed to sign free @-@ agent contracts with NFL teams . 
 On January 2 , 2008 , the Longhorns announced that defensive co @-@ coordinator Larry MacDuff would not return for the 2008 season and Duane Akina was demoted to " Assistant Head Coach / Defensive Backs " . The Longhorns hired Will Muschamp as defensive coordinator ; he will also coach UT 's linebackers . Muschamp was defensive coordinator at Auburn University and will earn a $ 425 @,@ 000 salary at Texas . Running backs coach Ken Rucker transferred to a newly created position with the athletic department where he will act as a liaison to high school athletic programs . On January 16 , 2008 Texas replaced Rucker by hiring former UT quarterback Major Applewhite . 
 = Glynn Lunney = 
 Glynn S. Lunney ( born November 27 , 1936 ) is a retired NASA engineer . An employee of NASA since its creation in 1958 , Lunney was a flight director during the Gemini and Apollo programs , and was on duty during historic events such as the Apollo 11 lunar ascent and the pivotal hours of the Apollo 13 crisis . At the end of the Apollo program , he became manager of the Apollo @-@ Soyuz Test Project , the first collaboration in spaceflight between the United States and the Soviet Union . Later , he served as manager of the Space Shuttle program before leaving NASA in 1985 and later becoming a vice president of the United Space Alliance . 
 Lunney was a key figure in the US manned space program from Project Mercury through the coming of the Space Shuttle . He has received numerous awards for his work , including the National Space Trophy , which he was given by the Rotary Club in 2005 . Chris Kraft , NASA 's first flight director , described Lunney as " a true hero of the space age " , saying that he was " one of the outstanding contributors to the exploration of space of the last four decades " . 
 = = Early life and NACA career = = 
 Glynn Lunney grew up in the coal city of Old Forge , Pennsylvania . He was the eldest son of William Lunney , a welder and former miner who encouraged his son to get an education and to find a job beyond the mines . Lunney graduated from the Scranton Preparatory School in 1953 . A childhood interest in model airplanes prompted Lunney to study engineering in college . After attending the University of Scranton from 1953 through 1955 , he transferred to the University of Detroit , where he enrolled in the cooperative training program run by the Lewis Research Center in Cleveland , Ohio . The center was a part of the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics ( NACA ) , a United States federal agency founded to promote aeronautical research . Cooperative students at NACA took part in a program that combined work and study , providing a way for them to fund their college degrees while gaining experience in aeronautics . Lunney graduated from college in June 1958 , with a Bachelor of Science degree in Aerospace engineering . 
 After graduation , Lunney remained with NACA . His first job was as a researcher in aerospace dynamics at Lewis Research Center , where he worked with a team studying the thermodynamics of vehicles during high @-@ speed reentry . Using a B @-@ 57 bomber , the team sent small rockets high into the atmosphere in order to measure their heating profile . 
 = = NASA career = = 
 = = = Mercury = = = 
 Only a month after Lunney graduated , President Eisenhower signed into existence the National Aeronautics and Space Administration ( NASA ) , into which NACA was subsumed . His timing was perfect , for as Lunney later said , " there was no such thing as space flight until the month I got out of college " . Lunney was soon transferred to Langley Research Center in Hampton , Virginia , where in September 1959 he became a member of the Space Task Group , which was the body given responsibility for the creation of NASA 's manned space program . Aged twenty @-@ one , he was the youngest of the forty @-@ five members of the group . His first assignment was with the Control Center Simulation Group , which planned the simulations used to train both flight controllers and astronauts for the as @-@ yet unknown experience of manned spaceflight . 
 A member of the Flight Operations Division , Lunney was one of the engineers responsible for planning and creating procedures for Project Mercury , America 's first manned space program . He took part in the writing of the first set of mission rules , the guidelines by which both flight controllers and astronauts operated . During Mercury , Lunney became , after <unk> Roberts , the second man to serve as the Flight Dynamics Officer ( FIDO ) in the Mercury Control Center , controlling the trajectory of the spacecraft and planning adjustments to it . His colleague Gene Kranz described him as " the pioneer leader of trajectory operations , who turned his craft from an art practiced by a few into a pure science " . It was during these years that Lunney became the protege of flight director Chris Kraft , a relationship that would last some twenty years . 
 Lunney worked both in the Control Center and at remote sites ; during the flight of John Glenn , America 's first orbital spaceflight , he was serving as the FIDO in Bermuda . In September 1961 , NASA 's Space Task Group was reorganized into the Manned Spacecraft Center and moved to Houston , Texas , and Lunney moved with it . In Houston , he became head of the Mission Logic and Computer Hardware section , where he defined and oversaw the computing and display requirements of the flight dynamics division within the new Mission Control Center . 
 = = = Gemini = = = 
 Gemini was a step forward for NASA 's manned space program : the Gemini capsule was larger and more advanced than Mercury , capable of supporting two men for up to a two @-@ week mission . Because of the longer mission durations , Mission Control began to be manned in shifts . In 1964 , Glynn Lunney and Gene Kranz were selected by Chris Kraft to join Kraft and his deputy John Hodge as flight directors . Aged only twenty @-@ eight , Lunney was the youngest of the four . 
 Lunney worked backup on Gemini 3 , taking charge of the newly established Mission Control Center in Houston , at a time when flights were still controlled from Cape Canaveral in Florida . On Gemini 4 , he again was working backup , this time in Florida , supporting the first mission that was controlled entirely from Houston . After spending some time on unmanned testing for the Apollo program , he returned to work as a flight director on Gemini 9 , 10 , 11 and 12 . 
 = = = Apollo = = = 
 As with Project Mercury , Lunney was involved in Project Apollo right from the beginning . He took charge of the " boilerplate " tests of the Apollo abort escape system at White Sands , which took place during the Gemini program , and was flight director during the first unmanned Saturn V test flight , SA @-@ 501 . However , he was not scheduled to serve as a flight director on the first manned Apollo mission , later known as Apollo 1 . During the countdown demonstration test that resulted in the Apollo 1 fire , Lunney was at home having dinner with astronaut Bill Anders and his wife , and was called into Mission Control when the fire occurred . It was , as he recalled , " a tremendous punch in the stomach to all of us " . The aftermath of the fire , in which three astronauts were killed , left Lunney and his colleagues at NASA feeling that they had perhaps failed to recognize the risks they were running in their efforts to meet Kennedy 's timetable of landing a man on the Moon by the end of the decade . " Maybe , " said Lunney over thirty years later , " we had gotten a little overconfident " . 
 Lunney attracted significant media attention in 1968 , when he worked as lead flight director on Apollo 7 , the first of the manned Apollo flights . Coming as it did after the Apollo 1 fire , the mission was an important test for the Apollo program , and was stressful for astronauts and controllers alike . Lunney had primary responsibility for dealing with the mission commander , Wally Schirra , who repeatedly questioned orders from the ground . Although pressed by reporters in news conferences , Lunney stayed diplomatic and said nothing critical of Schirra . Privately , however , he was extremely exasperated , and later assured his team of young controllers that " manned spaceflight is usually better than this " . He was also diplomatic about Donn Eisele 's sarcastic comment to the CAPCOM that he would " like to meet the man , or whomever it was , that dreamed up that little gem " . The " gem " turned out to be Lunney 's . 
 As a flight director Lunney was known for his good memory and his unusually quick thought processes — traits that could sometimes prove problematic for his team of flight controllers . " Glynn would drive you crazy " , said Jay Greene , a fellow controller , " because his mind would race so fast that he could churn out action items quicker than you could absorb , much less answer . " 
 During the Apollo 13 crisis , Lunney played a key role . Coming on shift an hour after the oxygen tank explosion that put the crew 's lives in jeopardy , Lunney and his team faced the unprecedented challenge of having to power up the lunar module on an extremely tight timeline , while transferring guidance and navigation data to it from the dying command module . His excellent memory and quick thinking were critical in the success of his team during the ensuing hours . Ken Mattingly , the astronaut who had been bumped from the Apollo 13 crew due to his exposure to German measles , later called Lunney 's performance " the most magnificent display of personal leadership that I ’ ve ever seen " . On the day following the Apollo 13 splashdown , Lunney joined his fellow flight directors in accepting the Presidential Medal of Freedom as a member of the Apollo 13 mission operations team . The award was made by President Nixon during a ceremony at the Manned Spacecraft Center . 
 = = = Apollo @-@ Soyuz Test Program = = = 
 In 1970 , while still a flight director , Lunney was selected as one of the members of a NASA delegation to the Soviet Union , which was to discuss the possibility of cooperation between the two countries in the field of manned spaceflight . " For me it was out of the clear blue sky " , said Lunney , who was told of the plans while at a conference in early October . " I did not know anything about [ the proposed talks ] until that time . " The trip took place in late October . While in Moscow , Lunney gave a presentation to Soviet engineers on the techniques that NASA used for orbital rendezvous , and on the compromises that would have to be made in order to achieve a rendezvous between American and Soviet spacecraft . The technical agreement that he helped to draft laid the groundwork for the mission which was to become the Apollo @-@ Soyuz Test Project ( ASTP ) . It was intended to be a joint mission , whose highlight was to be a docking between an American Apollo spacecraft and a Soviet Soyuz . 
 Lunney was named technical director of the ASTP in the following year . As technical director , he made several more trips to the Soviet Union , helping to negotiate the seventeen @-@ point agreement that would govern the conduct of the mission . He also took part in working groups in Houston that dealt with the technical details of the project . A New York Times profile reported that he was taking Russian lessons in order to be better prepared for the role . 
 On June 13 , 1972 , Lunney was given overall responsibility for the test project ; henceforth he would be in charge not only of building a partnership with the Soviets , but also of mission planning and of negotiating with North American Rockwell , the spacecraft contractor . According to the official history of the ASTP , Lunney 's performance during Apollo 13 and during the Soviet negotiations had recommended him to Chris Kraft , who was by then director of Johnson Space Center . In 1973 , Lunney became manager of the Apollo Spacecraft Program Office , a position which gave him responsibility for the Apollo spacecraft used during Skylab missions , as well giving him more authority in his role as head of the ASTP . 
 The ASTP mission took place in July 1975 . It was criticized by some journalists as a " costly space circus " , who felt that it wasted NASA funds that could have been better spent on projects such as Skylab . However , Lunney supported the project , saying in a later interview that he did not believe the cooperation necessary to build the International Space Station would have been possible if ASTP had not laid the groundwork for it . 
 = = = Space Shuttle = = = 
 After the ASTP mission was completed , Lunney became manager of the Shuttle Payload Integration and Development Program . During this period , it was anticipated that NASA 's space shuttle fleet would be flying very frequent missions , and carrying commercial payloads as well as flying missions for government organizations such as the Department of Defense and the Jet Propulsion Laboratory . The payload integration program was responsible for determining how the various demands of these customers could be satisfied , and how mixed payloads could best be physically accommodated within the cargo bay of the shuttle . During these years Lunney also spent time working at NASA Headquarters in Washington , D.C. , as Deputy Associate Administrator for Space Flight and later as Acting Associate Administrator for Space Transportation Operations . 
 In 1981 , Lunney became manager of the space shuttle program , a high @-@ level position where Lunney found himself responsible for setting the agenda for the developing program . His responsibilities were broad ones ; they included supervising program planning , budgeting and scheduling ; systems engineering ; and mission planning . During the earlier shuttle flights he was even involved in determining whether the weather was suitable for launch , but in later years that responsibility was largely devolved to lower levels of the hierarchy . 
 Many of his colleagues had expected Lunney to succeed his mentor , Chris Kraft , as director of Johnson Space Center ; Neil Hutchinson , a fellow flight director , later commented that Lunney " was sort of the anointed one " . However , when Kraft retired in 1982 , former Apollo flight director Gerry Griffin was offered the position instead . 
 In 1985 , Lunney decided to leave NASA , feeling that the shuttle program had worn him out physically and mentally and that he was ready for a new type of challenge . Although he had retired from NASA the year before , he was called to testify before the U.S. House Committee on Science and Technology in the aftermath of the Challenger accident . While still manager of the shuttle program , he had signed the " Criticality 1 " waiver that allowed Challenger to launch even though the joints of its solid rocket boosters had recently been redefined as non @-@ redundant systems . His actions were not unusual in the context of NASA practice at the time , which allowed a " walk through " of such potentially controversial waivers if no debate was expected . 
 = = Career at Rockwell = = 
 Upon leaving NASA in 1985 , Lunney took a position at Rockwell International , the contractor responsible for the construction , operation and maintenance of the space shuttle . At first he worked in California , managing a Rockwell division that was building satellites for the Global Positioning System ; this was his first experience with unmanned spacecraft . In 1990 , he returned to Houston as President of the Rockwell Space Operations Company , which provided support for flight operations at Johnson Space Center and employed about 3000 people . For Lunney , this represented a return to his roots in mission operations , which he had left twenty years before . 
 In 1995 , Rockwell joined forces with its competitor Lockheed Martin to form the United Space Alliance , a jointly owned organization created to provide operations support for NASA , as well as to take over some of the functions previously performed by NASA employees . At this point , Lunney became Vice President and Program Manager of the United Space Alliance 's spaceflight operations in Houston ; he stayed in this position until his retirement in 1999 . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 While at Lewis Research Center , Lunney met Marilyn Kurtz , who worked there as a nurse . They have been married since 1960 and have four children : Jennifer , Glynn , Jr . ( Distinguished Professor of Law at Tulane University ) , Shawn , and Bryan . Their youngest son Bryan has also pursued a career at NASA , becoming a flight director in 2001 and working missions including STS @-@ 115 , STS @-@ 120 , STS @-@ 123 , STS @-@ 131 and STS @-@ 133 . 
 During his leisure hours , Lunney enjoys sailing ; during the sixties the family owned a twenty @-@ foot sailboat which they took out on Galveston Bay , and he occasionally dreamed of going with his wife and children on an ocean cruise lasting for months . In his retirement he has taken up golf , saying that " I have come to realize that golf will never be mastered , but will continue to be humbling . " 
 = = Awards and honors = = 
 Lunney is a Fellow of the American Astronomical Society and of the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics . In 1971 , he was awarded an honorary Doctorate from the University of Scranton . He has received many awards from NASA , including three Group Achievement Awards , two Exceptional Service Medals and three Distinguished Service Medals . 
 In 2005 , he received the National Space Trophy from the Rotary National Award for Space Achievement Foundation . The award is given to individuals who have made an outstanding and career @-@ spanning contribution to America 's space program . Previous winners have included Chris Kraft and Neil Armstrong . " Lunney 's innovation and dedication to the U.S. space flight program " , said the <unk> Advisor General , " has set a standard for current and future generations of space explorers . As a manager , he inspired his employees to do their best work and offered direction and encouragement to his team when challenges arose ; as an explorer , he always looked toward the future and saw the endless possibilities and benefits of man 's journey into space . " 
 In 2008 he received the Elmer A. Sperry Award , jointly with Thomas P. Stafford , Aleksei A. Leonov and Konstantin D. <unk> , for their work on the Apollo @-@ Soyuz mission and the Apollo @-@ Soyuz docking interface design . 
 = = In films = = 
 In the movie Apollo 13 , Glynn Lunney was portrayed by Marc McClure . However , McClure had a relatively minor role . Writer Charles Murray lamented the fact that Lunney was " barely visible in the movie " , being overshadowed by the focus on Lunney 's fellow flight director Gene Kranz . " Without slighting Kranz 's role " , Murray commented , " the world should remember that it was Glynn Lunney ... who orchestrated a masterpiece of improvisation that moved the astronauts safely to the lunar module while sidestepping a dozen potential catastrophes that could have doomed them . " 
 Lunney has been interviewed in numerous documentaries about the space program , including Apollo 13 : To the Edge and Back ( PBS ) , To the Moon ( PBS ) , Failure is Not an Option ( History Channel ) and ABC News 20 / 20 's Moment of Crisis : Apollo 13 .

 = M @-@ 125 ( Michigan highway ) = 
 M @-@ 125 is a 19 1 ⁄ 2 @-@ mile @-@ long ( 31 @.@ 4 km ) state trunkline highway in the US state of Michigan . The highway is entirely within Monroe County with the southern terminus on the Ohio state border near Toledo and a northern terminus at US Highway 24 ( US 24 ) in Frenchtown Township , 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) north of Monroe . M @-@ 125 runs through rural farmlands and connects a couple of smaller towns with Monroe . It has an unsigned connector highway that links the main highway with Interstate 75 ( I @-@ 75 ) . 
 The highway is a section of the former Dixie Highway and US 25 in the state . It was first added to the state highway system in 1926 and given its current number in 1973 . Previously there were two other highways that carried the M @-@ 125 moniker . One in the 1930s ran through the Upper Peninsula near Thompson and a second from 1938 until the mid @-@ 1950s was located in Bay County . The current designation was created in 1973 when US 25 was decommissioned in Michigan . The section in downtown Monroe was named what is now a Pure Michigan Byway in 1995 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 M @-@ 125 starts at the state line as the continuation of Detroit Avenue running northward from Toledo . Once across the state line , the roadway takes on the Dixie Highway name and passes a residential subdivision . The highway runs north @-@ northeasterly roughly parallel with , and between , both US 24 and I @-@ 75 through farm land in rural Monroe County . The trunkline passes through the community of Erie before intersecting with Conn . M @-@ 125 ( Summit Street ) north of town . That unsigned connector is a state highway that links M @-@ 125 with I @-@ 75 to the south . Continuing north , M @-@ 125 intersects Luna Pier Road , which to the west is the unsigned Conn . US 24 that offers a path to US 24 ( Telegraph Road ) . 
 The route of M @-@ 125 changes direction slightly as it passes through the community of LaSalle ; north of town it follows a more northeasterly course . The roadway passes through residential areas north of town as it approaches Monroe . South of the city , M @-@ 125 crosses the La Plaisance Creek and turns north @-@ northwesterly through South Monroe . North of Lake Monroe , the road name changes from Dixie Highway to Monroe Street . The highway is the main street of the downtown area as it crosses the River Raisin upstream from the River Raisin National Battlefield Park . M @-@ 125 exits town near The Mall of Monroe . About five miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) north of Monroe , after running through farm land again , M @-@ 125 terminates at an intersection where Dixie Highway merges into US 24 ( Telegraph Road ) . 
 M @-@ 125 is maintained by the Michigan Department of Transportation ( MDOT ) like other state highways in Michigan . As a part of these maintenance responsibilities , the department tracks the volume of traffic that uses the roadways under its jurisdiction . These volumes are expressed using a metric called annual average daily traffic , which is a statistical calculation of the average daily number of vehicles on a segment of roadway . MDOT 's surveys in 2011 showed that the highest traffic levels along M @-@ 125 were the 21 @,@ 229 vehicles daily between Jones and Front streets in Monroe ; the lowest counts were the 2 @,@ 306 vehicles per day between Stearns and Erie roads near Erie . No section of M @-@ 125 has been listed on the National Highway System , a network of roads important to the country 's economy , defense , and mobility .

 M @-@ 125 was first designated on a road in the Upper Peninsula from US 2 to north of Thompson in 1931 ; this roadway was later merged into M @-@ 149 in 1936 after a rerouting of US 2 through the area . Later in 1938 , the M @-@ 125 designation was used for a highway under construction along Parish Road in Bay County running for three miles ( 4 @.@ 8 km ) west of US 23 ( now M @-@ 13 ) . The highway intersected US 23 between Kawkawlin and Linwood and ran westward to 7 Mile Road . It was completed as a gravel road in 1939 , and paved by 1945 . The second M @-@ 125 was transferred back to local control in late 1956 or early 1957 .

 The Dixie Highway was conceived in 1915 to connect Chicago to Miami and commemorate a half @-@ century since the end of the Civil War . On the suggestion of Governor Woodbridge Ferris , representatives from Michigan convinced the Dixie Highway Association to include Michigan in the proposed auto trail . Two divisions through the Lower Peninsula were included , the eastern one included a route between Detroit and Toledo via Monroe . This section of the Dixie Highway in Monroe County was first added to the state highway system in 1926 when US 25 was created . The highway was rerouted through downtown Monroe in the early 1930s ; instead of turning westward in downtown to connect to Telegraph Road , the highway instead continued northward to the current Dixie Highway – Telegraph Road intersection . When the US 25 designation was decommissioned in the state in 1973 , the highway segment between the state line and the Monroe area was given the M @-@ 125 designation . The routing has remained unchanged since . In 1995 , the section through downtown Monroe was named what is now a Pure Michigan Byway .

 " Nightswimming " is the eighth episode of the American television police procedural fantasy drama Awake , which originally aired on the National Broadcasting Company ( NBC ) on April 19 , 2012 . Written by Leonard Chang and co @-@ executive producer Davey Holmes , " Nightswimming " was watched by 2 @.@ 8 million viewers , including 0 @.@ 9 percent of those aged between 18 and 49 in Nielsen ratings , upon its initial broadcast in the United States . Directed by executive producer Jeffrey Reiner , this episode received generally mixed reviews . 
 Awake centers on Michael Britten ( Jason Isaacs ) , a detective living in two separate realities after a car crash . In one reality , in which he wears a red wristband , his wife Hannah ( Laura Allen ) survived the crash , and in another reality , in which he wears a green wristband , his son Rex ( Dylan Minnette ) survived . In this episode , Michael helps Accountant Marcus <unk> ( Elijah Alexander ) and his wife Alina ( Ayelet Zurer ) start a new life in the Witness Protection Program after a gang member attempts to kill Marcus in the " green reality " . In the " red reality " , Michael and Hannah prepare for a new life in Oregon after deciding to move there . They go swimming at a college pool to celebrate their love . 
 Many commentators praised the storylines of the " red reality " , but criticized the arcs of the " green reality " . This episode marked the first absence of Rex , as well as the show 's two therapists : Dr. Jonathan Lee ( BD Wong ) and Dr. Judith Evans ( Cherry Jones ) . Although it was the eighth broadcast episode , it was scheduled to be the fifth episode . The music featured in this installment was " Pain in My Heart " by Otis Redding . Michael is seen shirtless in two scenes of this episode , one of which was filmed at an actual campus swimming pool . During filming , a woman who was near the swimming pool confronted Isaacs about his nudity . Several of the episode 's themes have been critically examined . It was filmed in Los Angeles , California , while eight guest actors starred in this episode .

 The Brittens are involved in a fatal car crash . As a result , Michael , a Los Angeles Police Department ( LAPD ) detective , begins to live in two separate realities . In one reality , in which he wears a red wristband , his wife Hannah ( Laura Allen ) survives the crash , and in the other reality , in which he wears a green wristband , his son Rex ( Dylan Minnette ) survives . Michael does not know which reality is real , and uses the wristbands to differentiate the two . 
 Michael sees two separate therapists : Dr. Jonathan Lee ( BD Wong ) in the " red reality " , and Dr. Judith Evans ( Cherry Jones ) in the " green reality " . Meanwhile , in the " red reality " , Michael and Hannah continue with their plan to move to Oregon . Michael works with Detective Isaiah " Bird " Freeman ( Steve Harris ) in the " green reality " and with Detective Efrem Vega ( Wilmer Valderrama ) in the " red reality " after the crash .

 In the " red reality " , two police officers are sitting in a car talking when they receive a report of a break @-@ in at a local college swimming pool . They see Michael running naked from the pool and chase him ; when they tell him to stop running , Michael identifies himself as a detective . Meanwhile , in the " green reality " , Accountant Marcus <unk> ( Elijah Alexander ) exits his house and makes a phone call . Marcus then walks over to his car and tries to start it , but notices a bomb in the car 's engine and runs away shortly before it explodes . Soon after , at the police station , Michael and Bird tell Marcus that they will protect him . Marcus ' wife , Alina ( Ayelet Zurer ) , comes into the station , where Marcus explains what has happened . Shortly after talking with Marcus and Alina , Michael and Bird take the couple to a hotel for temporary shelter . In the " red reality " , Michael notices Hannah cleaning up and packing items before they move to Oregon . Soon after , Michael takes Vega to meet his confidential informant ( CI ) , Jake ( Steve Lawrence ) , with whom he will work after Michael leaves . Jake does not want to work with Vega for an unknown reason , but gives the pair a tip about a warehouse . 
 That night , Michael , Vega and the SWAT team watch the warehouse but no one shows up ; Vega wonders if Jake had given incorrect information . Back in the " green reality " , Michael goes to the hotel , since Alina had left in the middle of the night . Once there , Marcus warns Michael and Bird that if they do not find her , Marcus will give himself up to Maxim Basayev , his mobster boss . Back at the station , after looking at evidence , Michael decides to talk to the hotel staff where Alina and Marcus are staying , with Bird , rather than Alina 's friends . Later , Michael and Bird go to the home of Greg Hollander ( Ron Melendez ) , one of Alina 's friends , but do not find Greg , the person they would like to question regarding Alina 's whereabouts . Hollander , who is tied up , kicks down a table as the detectives leave , notifying the cops that he is in there . As the criminals run away , Bird and Michael break into the house ; Bird and Michael enter the house , while Bird shoots the two gang members . After that , they speak to Greg , who tells them that Alina constantly talks about how she and her husband have grown apart . Michael goes to search for Alina at a beach and finds her there . The two talk about Marcus and everything that happened previously . Michael explains that she has a chance to start over and takes her back to the hotel . In the " red reality " , at Jake 's home , Jake says he and Vega can have dinner alone to get to know each other . That night , Michael and Hannah go nude swimming at the college pool . 
 = = Production = = 
 " Nightswimming " was the first episode of the series to have been written by Leonard Chang and co @-@ executive producer Davey Holmes ; Chang later helmed " Say Hello to My Little Friend " and the series ' finale " Turtles All the Way Down " , while Holmes went on to write the teleplay of " Two Birds " . The entry was directed by executive producer Jeffrey Reiner , his third directing credit for the show . Reiner also directed two earlier installments — " The Little Guy " and Guilty " , the second and third entries of the program . Stuart Blatt served as the episode 's production designer , while Todd Desrosiers edited the music . 
 This entry was rated TV @-@ 14 in the United States during its original broadcast on television . Although it was the eighth broadcast episode , it was scheduled to be the fifth episode , until the National Broadcasting Company ( NBC ) decided to change the broadcasting order . The entry 's production code was " <unk> " . " Nightswimming " marked the first absence of Rex , as well as the show 's two therapists : Dr. Lee and Dr. Evans . Eight cast members guest starred in this entry . Actress Laura Innes returned to the episode as Captain Tricia Harper , while Lawrence made his first and only appearance as Jake . Alexander , Zurer , Melendez , Blackman , Holden and Todorov also made their first and only appearances as Marcus , Alina , Hollander , Vasily , Shapiro and Alexander , respectively . This entry featured " Pain in My Heart " , a song by Otis Redding , which was played during one of a number of scenes where Michael is seen shirtless . 
 The installment was filmed and set in Los Angeles , California , as were all other Awake episodes . During filming of the installment , Isaacs thought it would be funny to moon down the stairs during a scene in which Hannah and Michael go nude swimming , but stated that it would probably break the Standards and Practices law . Filming of the episode commenced at an actual campus swimming pool for one scene . A lady present during filming asked if Isaacs was naked . Isaacs replied that he was not completely naked , but had a " small piece of material taped over [ his ] genitals " ; the lady said " That 's naked , " adding " I can see your butt crack . " In response , Isaacs " taped a piece of material over [ his ] butt crack " . When the last scene was filmed that day , he ran up the stairs , causing the material — which had been secured only by a piece of sealing tape — to fall off . The woman was " furious " . Isaacs thought that the team of Awake would have to withdraw the footage , but was happy to see that part was included in the finished episode . 
 = = Themes = = 
 Although it did not directly impact the ongoing storyline of Awake , " Nightswimming " introduced and continued key thematic elements of the series . It was described as a " long , roundabout " episode that is " bent on making [ Michael ] fully commit to moving to Oregon with Hannah " by Matt Fowler from IGN . Fowler thought that , since Rex was not in the episode , the " green reality " seemed more like a dream . In a review of the following episode , " Game Day " , he admitted that he thought Alina was behind Marcus ' car bomb , since he thought that this story would have an arrest by the end . Writing for HitFix , Alan Sepinwall opined that Michael is " coming to grips with Hannah 's desire to move because he loves her that much " . However , the Brittens later decided not to move in " Slack Water " , the series ' tenth episode , owing to personal concerns . 
 Sepinwall noted that he could see " the obvious parallels to Michael 's personal situation " in this installment , while The A.V. Club editor Zack Handlen said that Awake " continues to connect routine procedural storylines and find new ways to give them deeper meaning " . Screen Rant writer Kevin Yeoman said that this episode was about " bringing two people who have drifted apart back together " and that " Nightswimming " has " balanced the series ' larger mystery with grief and a twinge of optimism " on a " smaller scale " compared to other entries of the program . He claimed that the installment was designed to " introduce us to what makes Hannah and Michael so special " , adding that " For most of the series , there hasn 't been much chemistry between the two " . 
 In his real reality check , a prediction on which reality is real by the end of the particular episode , Nick McHatton , a TV Fanatic writer , chose the " red reality " , because it was " nice to see why Hannah and Michael love each other " , while Handlen claimed that " the show has done a fine job at largely standalone episodes " , but each episode " feels like its own separate story " . He assumed that " there 's little feel of rising intensity or greater danger " , " given the hints of conspiracy and the ever intensifying threat of Oregon " . Caroline Preece of Den of Geek initially assumed " this random nakedness will tie in to the show 's central mythology " , though she later found out Michael was just swimming nude with Hannah . Preece thought that Hannah and Michael " reconnected " in the episode , as did McHatton . Due to Rex 's absence , she thought that this episode allowed viewers to get to know Hannah . 
 = = Broadcast and reception = = 
 " Nightswimming " originally aired on NBC on April 19 , 2012 , and was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on Sky Atlantic on June 22 , 2012 . According to Nielsen ratings , an audience measurement system that determine the audience size and composition of television programming , the episode 's initial broadcast in the United States was viewed by approximately 2 @.@ 8 million viewers and earned a 0 @.@ 9 rating / 2 percent share in the 18 – 49 demographic , meaning that it was seen by 0 @.@ 9 percent of all 18- to 49 @-@ year @-@ olds and 2 percent of 18- to 49 @-@ year @-@ olds watching television at the time of the broadcast . In the United Kingdom , the episode obtained 287 @,@ 000 viewers , making it the second most @-@ viewed program for that channel behind Hit & Miss . 
 This episode received generally mixed reviews from critics . Sepinwall was disappointed with the overall storyline of the " green reality " ; he claimed that if the episode was only based on the " red reality " , the entry would have been " perfectly fine " . Meanwhile , Handlen thought that if the arcs of the " red reality " were not included in this installment , it would not work as an episode . While Sepinwall called the " green reality " storyline " boring " , Handlen thought that the storylines of Marcus and Alina did not " matter " ; according to Handlen , the episode should not have gotten into the details of the guest stars . Sepinwall and Handlen were disappointed that Rex did not appear in the episode ; Handlen praised Rex , calling him a " likable teenage boy " who deserves more running time . 
 Handlen thought that Michael sounded " reasonable " , and Sepinwall said " Awake ... [ has previously done ] a good job of making the guest characters involved in [ Michael ] ' s cases interesting enough that I care about what happens in each investigation . " He thought that until this episode the writers had been wise on guest stars and on not focusing on them too much ; he also wrote that actors Lawrence and Valderrama did not seem to match each other . Handlen was rather impressed with the storylines of the " red reality " and gave the episode a " B + " , writing that " Jake reminded [ him ] of Al Pacino 's aging [ gang member ] in Donnie Brasco . " Sepinwall liked Jake 's actor , Lawrence , praising his appearance on the Awake episode . 
 Fowler showed disappointment as the entry gave no " twists " or " problems " regarding Michael , or his therapy sessions . He compared " Nightswimming " to other Awake episodes , claiming that other entries offer more " plot " and " emotional " problems , while Preece called the entry " strange " . She thought that the storylines of the " red reality " were more " interesting " than the " green reality " storylines , and Fowler was disappointed with the song choice for the installment , claiming that the R.E.M. song " Nightswimming " should have been played instead . Preece described the " Nightswimming " episode as a " dull procedural episode " that is devoid of any mythology or forward motion ; she called the installment " flat " . Despite saying that she was " losing patience " with Awake , Preece said that she was still " keen " to see more . 
 While Preece wrote that the episode was missing key elements from previous episodes , Fowler criticized the installment , since the first fifteen minutes of the entry were about Marcus and Elena and their lives . Despite this , Fowler praised the final scene of the episode , and Preece called Michael and Hannah 's relationship " lovely " . Fowler gave this a " 7 @.@ 5 " " good " rating , the lowest score for an Awake episode at that time . Preece thought that the episode made " little mistakes " , which Awake could not afford to make . McHatton said that " Nightswimming " contains " No conspiracies , no killers , not even murders " , just a " procedural case that mirrored [ Michael ] ' s life at home " . Despite this , he praised Michael and Hannah 's relationship , claiming that " it 's nice to watch as they reconnect with each other " ; he gave it a " 4 @.@ 5 " rating out of " 5 @.@ 0 " . Meanwhile , Yeoman stated that the entry opened to " a certain amount of whimsy " and that , " starting [ the episode ] off with the series ' protagonist in the buff isn 't exactly textbook . " 
 = Lillehammer Olympiapark = 
 Lillehammer Olympiapark AS , trading as <unk> , is a company established following the 1994 Winter Olympics to operate the Olympic venues in Lillehammer , Norway . Owned by Lillehammer Municipality , it operates five sports venues : Birkebeineren Ski Stadium , Håkons Hall , Lillehammer Olympic Bobsleigh and Luge Track , Kanthaugen Freestyle Arena and the ski jumping hill of Lysgårdsbakken . In addition to serving sports events , the company provides tourist and group activities at the venues as well as catering to larger events . 
 In the Lillehammer bid for the 1994 Winter Olympics , the agreement between Lillehammer Municipality and the state specified that the municipality was responsible for financing all necessary sports venues . However , after the games were awarded the responsibility was taken over by Lillehammer Olympic Organizing Committee ( LOOC ) and the town 's five venues were ultimately funded through state grants . To allow for post @-@ Olympic use , a fund was created by the state , of which Lillehammer Olympiapark received 146 million Norwegian krone ( NOK ) . Unlike the Hamar venues , which survive on their fund 's yield , the Lillehammer venues have used up their capital . From 2014 the post @-@ Olympic use fund will be depleted and alternative organization and funding is being looked into . A leading proposal is that the bobsleigh and luge track be taken over by the state , while the remaining venues be retained by the company and jointly funded by the municipality and Oppland County Municipality . 
 = = History = = 
 As part of the 1985 and 1987 agreements with the Parliament of Norway ahead of the 1994 Winter Olympics bid , Lillehammer Municipality was responsible for financing and building all Olympic venues and associated facilities . To fulfill their obligation , the municipality established Lillehammer Olympiske Anlegg ( LOA ) in 1989 . Mr. Haavind was hired as the company 's first managing director . At the same time the Post @-@ Olympics Use Committee was established to ensure activity at the venues after the Olympics . LOA 's first task was , in cooperation with local and national authorities and LOOC , to decide on locations and budgets . 
 By 1989 , political discussions had started regarding the creation of a fund to finance post @-@ Olympic use . The sledding track , especially , would incur high operating costs , estimated at between NOK 5 and 6 million per year . Total deficits for the five Lillehammer venues were in 1990 estimated at ca . NOK 15 million per year . Initially the government offered to grant NOK 55 million for the fund , but the Post @-@ Olympic Use Committee estimated that NOK 215 million would be necessary . They further proposed that the capital could be used as share capital in the proposed company Olympia <unk> , which would be jointly privately and publicly owned and operate the venues . 
 The budgets were reviewed by Parliament on 23 April 1990 . They also decided to re @-@ organize the Olympics into a concern model , which saw both LOA and the Post @-@ Olympics Use Committees becoming subsidiaries of LOOC , and the Post @-@ Olympics Use Committees changing its name to Lillehammer Olympiavekst ( LOV ) . Separate companies were established to construct the venues in Hamar and Gjøvik , owned by the respective municipalities . The municipal governments of Øyer and Ringebu each received a 24 @.@ 5 @-@ percent stake in LOV . Lillehammer Municipality gained a 24 @.@ 5 @-@ percent stake in the new holding company , Lillehammer ' 94 AS . Gerhard Heiberg , President of LOOC , was appointed chair of both LOV and LOA . LOV was given the responsibility for operating the venues after the Olympics . 
 LOOC and the Ministry of Local Government and Regional Development started negotiations concerning the fund in October 1990 . The government increased the fund size to NOK 130 million in January 1991 , as well as allocating NOK 70 of the reserve funding to post @-@ Olympic use . Lillehammer Municipality stated that they wanted a disproportionate share of the funding , but this was rejected by Minister Kjell Borgen . The fund would be insufficient , which caused a conflict between the five municipalities . Gjøvik and Hamar chose not to take an ownership stake in LOV as they did not want a Lillehammer @-@ based company to manage the towns ' main venues . At the same time , Lillehammer Municipality did not want the two other towns to own part of LOV , as they hoped the entire fund would be used to finance the five venues in Lillehammer . Gjøvik and Hamar took steps to create their own joint venture to operate their three arenas , while Borgen stated that all the venues should be allocated to one company . Ringebu Mayor Erik Winther stated that he felt that his municipality had been tricked into joining LOV and that they were not allowed to participate as an equal partner . 
 Haavind was replaced by Bjørn Sund in 1991 . The post @-@ use funds were distributed such that LOA received NOK 76 million . It also acquired a thirty @-@ percent stake in Hamar Olympiske Anlegg , which operates Vikingskipet and Hamar Olympic Amphitheatre in Hamar , and Gjøvik Olympiske Anlegg , which operates Gjøvik Olympic Cavern Hall in Gjøvik . Lillehammer was the only of the five host municipalities to not use municipal grants to build their venues . By late 1991 , LOOC desired a closer cooperation , resulting in a merger between LOA and Lillehammer ' 94 which took the latter 's name . By 1 January 1993 also LOV and LOOC had also been merged to a single entity . Planning of post @-@ Olympic use and demobilization started in early 1993 . 
 LOOC transferred the ownership of the Olympic venues in Lillehammer to the municipality for NOK 1 million on 7 September 1993 . By then the government had increased the post @-@ Olympic fund to NOK 200 million . Ownership of the Hamar and Gjøvik venues had previously been transferred to the respective municipal governments . The fund was established in September and is managed by a separate foundation , Stiftelsen Lillehammer <unk> . Additional capital for the fund was secured through LOOC 's financial buffers not being used and the surplus transferred to the funds . In June 1994 the fund was set to NOK 401 @.@ 3 million . 
 Minister of Local Government and Regional Development , Gunnar Berge , stated in January 1995 that he was concerned that the post @-@ Olympic use funds were being used up too quickly and that money was being used for unsuitable projects . However , he rejected that the state should take control over the venues or the money . After one year , Lillehammer Olympiapark had used NOK 32 of 146 million , while the company Olympia Utvikling / Troll Park had used NOK 14 of 95 million . For the Lillehammer companies , this meant that the fund was estimated to run out after ten instead of twenty years . In contrast , Hamar Olympiske Anlegg had only used the fund 's yield . LOOC criticized the post @-@ Olympic use companies , stating that they were too bureaucratic , that their combined 100 employees were too many , and that one or two companies would be sufficient . 
 By 1999 , Lillehammer Olympiapark had an annual revenue of NOK 20 million , of which a third came from the fund . Commercial activities contributed half the revenue , while the remaining fraction came from sports activities . Between 80 and 90 percent of the rental time went to sports activities . A report published by Lillehammer University College in 2007 concluded that all the 260 permanent jobs created in the Lillehammer area as a result of the Olympics were directly dependent on subsidies from the post @-@ Olympic use funds . In the late 2000s , Lillehammer Olympiapark was using between NOK 8 and 12 million per year . There was NOK 25 million left in the fund in 2012 , which is scheduled to be closed in 2014 , after it has served for 20 years . Lillehammer Olympiapark started planning the organization of the venues in 2010 . The company recommended that the subsidies be equally funded between Lillehammer Municipality , Oppland County Municipality and the Ministry of Culture . Specifically it recommended that the state take over ownership of the bobsleigh and luge track , while the county took partial ownership of Lillehammer Olympiapark . The state would thus continue to finance the track , which is the only such venue in Northern Europe , while the municipality and county finance the other four venues . The venues are recommended held to such a standard that they can host world cup and world championships in relevant sports . 
 = = Operations = = 
 As of 2010 , the company had a revenue of NOK 56 million , up NOK 10 million from 2009 , yielding a profit of NOK 2 million . The company employed between 51 and 55 people , it is based at Håkons Hall and is entirely owned by Lillehammer Municipality . The company 's revenue comes from a series of sources , the most important being events and tourists . At Lysgårdsbakken , the company operates a chairlift and viewing platform at the top of the tower , as well as a downhill and bobsleigh simulator . The company tailors events to companies with various activities at the hill , including a ceremony to light to Olympic Flame . Kanthaugen and its lift is rented out for tobogganing . The sledding track serves groups and tourists with activities such as <unk> and for @-@ man bobsleigh with an authorized pilot , <unk> , skeleton and skeleton rafting . Next to the track is an activity park with activities such as snowmobile and all @-@ terrain vehicle tracks .

 Al @-@ Risalah al @-@ <unk> ( Arabic : <unk> <unk> , Arabic pronunciation : [ ' <unk> ' <unk> <unk> ] ; " The Golden Treatise " ) is a medical dissertation on health and remedies attributed to Ali ibn Musa al @-@ Ridha ( 765 – 818 ) , the eighth Imam of Shia . He wrote this dissertation in accordance with the demand of Ma 'mun , the caliph of the time . It is revered as the most precious Islamic literature in the science of medicine , and was entitled " the golden treatise " as Ma 'mun had ordered it written in gold ink . The chain of narrators is said to reach Muhammad ibn <unk> or al @-@ Hassan ibn Muhammad al @-@ <unk> who is described as " highly esteemed and trustworthy " by al @-@ <unk> . 
 The treatise of Ali al @-@ Ridha includes scientific branches such as Anatomy , Physiology , Chemistry and Pathology when medical science was still primitive . According to the treatise , one 's health is determined by four humors of blood , yellow bile , black bile and phlegm , the suitable proportion of which maintains the health . The liver plays an important role in producing and maintaining the required proportions in the body . Ali al @-@ Ridha describes the body as a kingdom whose king is the heart while the ( blood ) vessels , the limbs , and the brain are the laborers . 
 = = Author = = 
 The treatise is authored by Ali al @-@ Ridha who was the seventh descendant of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and the eighth of the Twelve Imams . His given name was ' Alī ibn <unk> ibn Ja 'far . He was born in the house of Imam Musa al @-@ Kadhim ( the seventh Imam of Twelver Shia Islam ) in Medina on the eleventh of Dhu al @-@ Qi 'dah , 148 AH ( December 29 , 765 CE ) . Ali al @-@ Ridha was summoned to Khurasan and reluctantly accepted the role of successor to Ma 'mun that was forced on him . He did not outlive Ma 'mun , having been given poisoned grapes by him while accompanying him in Persia , and died at Tus on May 26 , 818 . Ali al @-@ Ridha is buried within Imam Ridha Mosque , in Mashhad , Iran .

 The Ma 'mun 's palace was a center for philosophical and scientific researches in which many scientific seminars were held . One of the mentioned seminars was on man 's body which included the greatest scholars and leaders . Ali al @-@ Ridha , Ma 'mun , Gabriel b . <unk> ( the physician ) , <unk> ( the physician ) and Salih ibn <unk> ( the Indian philosopher ) were some participants of that medical seminar . The participants were involved in a lengthy discussion about the body makeup and various types of foods , while Ali al @-@ Ridha kept silent . Afterwards , Ma 'mun asked him to demonstrate his knowledge of physiology and nutrition and Imam replied : 
 I have of it knowledge of what I have personally tested and came to know about its accuracy by experience and by the passage of time in addition to what I was told by my ancestors of what no body afford to be ignorant of , nor excused for leaving it . I shall compile it with an equal portion of what everyone should know . 
 Soon after that , Ma 'mun departed for Balkh , and wrote to Imam asking him to fulfill his promise and write a treatise on the body and its health , hence Imam authored " The Golden Treatise " at the request of Ma 'mun .

 The dissertation of Ali al @-@ Ridha includes scientific branches such as Anatomy , Physiology , Chemistry and Pathology when medical science was still <unk> it begins as follows : 
 In the Name of Allah , the Most Gracious , the Most Merciful . Know , when Allah tries a servant with a disease , he appoints for him a medicine in order to cure himself with it , and for every kind of disease there is a kind of medicine , conduct , and prescription . 
 Ali al @-@ Ridha writes in his treatise that one 's health is in accordance with the balance of phlegm , yellow bile , blood and black bile ; an individual becomes sick when this proportion is unbalanced . Nutrition and traditional medicine may be used to cure imbalances . The liver plays an important role in producing and maintaining the required proportions in the body . 
 Ali al @-@ Ridha describes the body as a kingdom whose king is the heart while the ( blood ) vessels , the limbs , and the brain are workers . He then continues as such : 
 The house of the king is his heart ; the body is his land ; his hands , his legs , eyes , lips , tongues , and his ears are the helpers ; his storekeepers are his stomach and ; and his chamberlain is his chest . Therefore , the hands are two helpers which bring ( things ) near , take ( them ) away , and work as the king reveals to them . The legs are king 's vehicle and carry him wherever he likes . The eyes lead the king to that which disappears from him 
 Imam al @-@ Rida names the main organs of the human body as the heart , the nerves , the brain , the hands and the Legs the ear and the eye . He discusses their characteristics and functions in detail . Regarding the human body containing systems and cells he said : 
 Do you think that you are a small body , while the greatest world has folded itself in you . 
 In another part of the treatise , he discusses what kind of foods are suitable according to season , time of the day and the age of an individual . He says :

 = New York State Route 177 = 
 New York State Route 177 ( NY 177 ) is an east – west state highway in the North Country of New York in the United States . It extends from Interstate 81 ( I @-@ 81 ) exit 42 in the Jefferson County town of Adams to NY 12 west of the Lewis County village of Lowville . NY 177 intersects U.S. Route 11 ( US 11 ) in Adams Center and meets Lewis County 's County Route 21 ( CR 21 ) , formerly part of NY 194 , at Barnes Corners . NY 177 originally began at US 11 when it was assigned in 1930 . It was extended west to its present terminus in the 1950s following the construction of I @-@ 81 . 
 = = Route description = = 
 NY 177 begins at interchange 42 on I @-@ 81 in the town of Adams . The route progresses away from the interstate to the southeast , passing the former railroad station in Adams Center before intersecting with US 11 in the center of the hamlet . At this intersection , NY 177 turns eastward , leaving the populated hamlet for a rural backdrop and into the hamlet of Honeyville . Honeyville consists of little more than a few houses centered on the intersection of NY 177 and Fuller Road . After leaving Honeyville , NY 177 intersects with CR 155 , where it turns to the southeast into the town of Rodman . After crossing a creek , the route enters the hamlet of Rodman as a two @-@ lane road through the southern end of the hamlet . During the stretch around Rodman , NY 177 intersects with CR 85 ( Creek Road ) and CR 97 ( Washington Park Road / School Street ) before leaving the hamlet . 
 NY 177 continues winding itself to the southeast through the town of Rodman , as a rural two @-@ lane highway . After Williams Road , the route makes several bends in to the south and east , straightening out eastward at an intersection with the northern terminus of CR 95 . This eastward progression remains stagnant as NY 177 continues eastward past CR 189 . After a short , empty stretch of roadway , NY 177 crosses the county line into Lewis County , where it enters the town of Pinckney . Through Pinckney , the route turns to the northeast , crossing Old State Road before bending and turning southeastward into the hamlet of Barnes Corners . In Barnes Corners , the dense forest retreats for a rural community , where NY 177 intersects with CR 21 and CR 2 ( Seven @-@ by @-@ Nine Road ) . CR 21 is the former southern terminus of NY 194 , a designation eliminated in 1980 . 
 After leaving Barnes Corners , NY 177 returns to being the two @-@ lane rural roadway , progressing southeastward through the town of Pinckney . Despite the rural scenery , the route does enter the hamlet of New Boston and the junction with CR 23 ( Liberty Road ) . Passing a few farms , the route turns to the northeast near Mile Square Road , and enters the hamlet of Bellwood , within the town of Harrisburg . Bellwood consists of a few houses and an intersection with CR 27 and CR 28 ( Sears Pond Road ) . Leaving Bellwood , NY 177 continues eastward into the hamlet of <unk> , which consists only of a few houses . Leaving <unk> , NY 177 bends to the southeast and enters the town of Lowville , passing a few farms and wind turbines before bending into the hamlet of West Lowville . In West Lowville , NY 177 intersects with NY 12 , which continues eastward to the village of Lowville . NY 177 terminates at this intersection .

 NY 177 was assigned as part of the 1930 renumbering of state highways in New York . It originally extended from US 11 in Adams Center to NY 12 west of the village of Lowville . When the portion of I @-@ 81 near Adams Center was completed in the late 1950s , NY 177 was extended westward over a county @-@ maintained highway to meet the new expressway at exit 42 . On August 1 , 1979 , ownership and maintenance of NY 177 between I @-@ 81 and US 11 was transferred from Jefferson County to the state of New York as part of a highway maintenance swap between the two levels of government .

 = Red rain in Kerala = 
 The Kerala red rain phenomenon was a blood rain event that occurred from 25 July to 23 September 2001 , when heavy downpours of red @-@ coloured rain fell sporadically on the southern Indian state of Kerala , staining clothes pink . Yellow , green , and black rain was also reported . Coloured rain was also reported in Kerala in 1896 and several times since , most recently in June 2012 , and from 15 November 2012 to 27 December 2012 in eastern and north @-@ central provinces of Sri Lanka . 
 Following a light microscopy examination in 2001 , it was initially thought that the rains were coloured by fallout from a hypothetical meteor burst , but a study commissioned by the Government of India concluded that the rains had been coloured by airborne spores from a locally prolific terrestrial green alga from the genus Trentepohlia . An international team later identified the exact species as Trentepohlia annulata . 
 = = Occurrence = = 
 The coloured rain of Kerala began falling on 25 July 2001 , in the districts of Kottayam and Idukki in the southern part of the state . Yellow , green , and black rain was also reported . Many more occurrences of the red rain were reported over the following ten days , and then with diminishing frequency until late September . According to locals , the first coloured rain was preceded by a loud thunderclap and flash of light , and followed by groves of trees shedding shrivelled grey " burnt " leaves . Shriveled leaves and the disappearance and sudden formation of wells were also reported around the same time in the area . It typically fell over small areas , no more than a few square kilometres in size , and was sometimes so localised that normal rain could be falling just a few meters away from the red rain . Red rainfalls typically lasted less than 20 minutes . Each millilitre of rain water contained about 9 million red particles . Extrapolating these figures to the total amount of red rain estimated to have fallen , it was estimated that 50 @,@ 000 kilograms ( 110 @,@ 000 lb ) of red particles had fallen on Kerala . 
 = = Description of the particles = = 
 The brownish @-@ red solid separated from the red rain consisted of about 90 % round red particles and the balance consisted of debris . The particles in suspension in the rain water were responsible for the colour of the rain , which at times was strongly coloured red . A small percentage of particles were white or had light yellow , bluish grey and green tints . The particles were typically 4 to 10 µm across and spherical or oval . Electron microscope images showed the particles as having a depressed centre . At still higher magnification some particles showed internal structures . 
 = = Chemical composition = = 
 Some water samples were taken to the Centre for Earth Science Studies ( CESS ) in India , where they separated the suspended particles by filtration . The pH of the water was found to be around 7 ( neutral ) . The electrical conductivity of the rainwater showed the absence of any dissolved salts . Sediment ( red particles plus debris ) was collected and analysed by the CESS using a combination of ion @-@ coupled plasma mass spectrometry , atomic absorption spectrometry and wet chemical methods . The major elements found are listed below . The CESS analysis also showed significant amounts of heavy metals , including nickel ( 43 ppm ) , manganese ( 59 ppm ) , titanium ( 321 ppm ) , chromium ( <unk> ) and copper ( 55 ppm ) . 
 Louis and Kumar used energy dispersive X @-@ ray spectroscopy analysis of the red solid and showed that the particles were composed of mostly carbon and oxygen , with trace amounts of silicon and iron . A <unk> analyser showed content of 43 @.@ 03 % carbon , 4 @.@ 43 % hydrogen , and 1 @.@ 84 % nitrogen . 
 J. Thomas Brenna in the Division of Nutritional Sciences at Cornell University conducted carbon and nitrogen isotope analyses using a scanning electron microscope with X @-@ ray micro @-@ analysis , an elemental analyser , and an isotope ratio ( IR ) mass spectrometer . The red particles collapsed when dried , which suggested that they were filled with fluid . The amino acids in the particles were analysed and seven were identified ( in order of concentration ) : phenylalanine , glutamic acid / glutamine , serine , aspartic acid , threonine , and arginine . The results were consistent with a marine origin or a terrestrial plant that uses a C4 photosynthetic pathway . 
 = = Government report = = 
 Initially , the Centre for Earth Science Studies ( CESS ) stated that the likely cause of the red rain was an exploding meteor , which had dispersed about 1 @,@ 000 kg ( one ton ) of material . A few days later , following a basic light microscopy evaluation , the CESS retracted this as they noticed the particles resembled spores , and because debris from a meteor would not have continued to fall from the stratosphere onto the same area while unaffected by wind . A sample was , therefore , handed over to the Tropical Botanical Garden and Research Institute ( TBGRI ) for microbiological studies , where the spores were allowed to grow in a medium suitable for growth of algae and fungi . The inoculated Petri dishes and conical flasks were incubated for three to seven days and the cultures were observed under a microscope . 
 In November 2001 , commissioned by the Government of India 's Department of Science & Technology , the Centre for Earth Science Studies ( CESS ) and the Tropical Botanical Garden and Research Institute ( TBGRI ) issued a joint report , which concluded : 
 The colour was found to be due to the presence of a large amount of spores of a lichen @-@ forming alga belonging to the genus Trentepohlia . Field verification showed that the region had plenty of such lichens . Samples of lichen taken from Changanacherry area , when cultured in an algal growth medium , also showed the presence of the same species of algae . Both samples ( from rainwater and from trees ) produced the same kind of algae , indicating that the spores seen in the rainwater most probably came from local sources 
 The site was again visited on 16 August 2001 and it was found that almost all the trees , rocks and even lamp posts in the region were covered with Trentepohlia estimated to be in sufficient amounts to generate the quantity of spores seen in the rainwater . Although red or orange , Trentepohlia is a <unk> green alga which can grow abundantly on tree bark or damp soil and rocks , but is also the photosynthetic symbiont or photobiont of many lichens , including some of those abundant on the trees in Changanacherry area . The strong orange colour of the algae , which masks the green of the chlorophyll , is caused by the presence of large quantities of orange carotenoid pigments . A lichen is not a single organism , but the result of a partnership ( symbiosis ) between a fungus and an alga or cyanobacterium . 
 The report also stated that there was no meteoric , volcanic or desert dust origin present in the rainwater and that its colour was not due to any dissolved gases or pollutants . The report concluded that heavy rains in Kerala -in the weeks preceding the red <unk> could have caused the widespread growth of lichens , which had given rise to a large quantity of spores into the atmosphere . However , for these lichen to release their spores simultaneously , it is necessary for them to enter their reproductive phase at about the same time . The CESS report noted that while this may be a possibility , it is quite improbable . Also , they could find no satisfactory explanation for the apparently extraordinary dispersal , nor for the apparent uptake of the spores into clouds . CESS scientists noted that " While the cause of the colour in the rainfall has been identified , finding the answers to these questions is a challenge . " Attempting to explain the unusual spore proliferation and dispersal , researcher Ian Goddard proposed several local atmospheric models . 
 Parts of the CESS / TBGRI report were supported by Dr. Milton Wainwright at Sheffield University , who , together with Chandra Wickramasinghe , has studied stratospheric spores . In March 2006 Wainwright said the particles were similar in appearance to spores of a rust fungus , later saying that he had confirmed the presence of DNA , and reported their similarity to algal spores , and found no evidence to suggest that the rain contained dust , sand , fat globules , or blood . In November 2012 , Dr. Rajkumar <unk> and Dr. Stuart Hogg from the University of Glamorgan , UK , confirmed that the red rain cells from Kerala contain DNA . 
 In February 2015 , a team of scientists from India and Austria , also supported the identification of the algal spores as Trentepohlia annulata , however , they speculate that the spores from the 2011 incident were carried by winds from Europe to the Indian subcontinent . 
 = = = Phylogenetics = = = 
 A study published in February 2015 established that the exact species of green microalgae is Trentepohlia annulata . The study used molecular phylogenetics to compare the evolution of DNA sequences of T. annulata isolated from colored rain samples with that of T. annulata from Austria . The results suggest that the isolate from Kerala is a recently introduced species from Austria . The researchers suggest that the introduction happened through clouds over the <unk> a phenomenon of intercontinental species dispersal previously reported for bacteria and fungi , but first time for the alga . How exactly these lower stratospheric clouds containing algal spores got in Kerala remains unknown .

 History records many instances of unusual objects falling with the rain – in 2000 , in an example of raining animals , a small waterspout in the North Sea sucked up a school of fish a mile off shore , depositing them shortly afterwards on Great Yarmouth in the United Kingdom . Coloured rain is by no means rare , and can often be explained by the airborne transport of rain dust from desert or other dry regions which is washed down by rain . " Red Rains " have been frequently described in southern Europe , with increasing reports in recent years . One such case occurred in England in 1903 , when dust was carried from the Sahara and fell with rain in February of that year . 
 At first , the red rain in Kerala was attributed to the same effect , with dust from the deserts of Arabia initially the suspect . LIDAR observations had detected a cloud of dust in the atmosphere near Kerala in the days preceding the outbreak of the red rain . However , laboratory tests from all involved teams ruled out the particles were desert sand . 
 K.K. <unk> Pillai , a senior scientific assistant in the Indian Meteorological Department , proposed dust and acidic material from an eruption of Mayon Volcano in the Philippines as an explanation for the coloured rain and the " burnt " leaves . The volcano was erupting in June and July 2001 and Pillai calculated that the Eastern or Equatorial jet stream could have transported volcanic material to Kerala in 25 – 36 hours . The Equatorial jet stream is unusual in that it sometimes flows from east to west at about 10 ° N , approximately the same latitude as Kerala ( 8 ° N ) and Mayon Volcano ( 13 ° N ) . This hypothesis was also ruled out as the particles were neither acidic nor of volcanic origin , but were spores . 
 A study has been published showing a correlation between historic reports of coloured rains and of meteors ; the author of the paper , Patrick McCafferty , stated that sixty of these events ( coloured rain ) , or 36 % , were linked to meteoritic or cometary activity . But not always strongly . Sometimes the fall of red rain seems to have occurred after an air @-@ burst , as from a meteor exploding in air ; other times the odd rainfall is merely recorded in the same year as the appearance of a comet . 
 = = = Panspermia hypothesis = = = 
 In 2003 Godfrey Louis and Santhosh Kumar , physicists at the Mahatma Gandhi University in Kottayam , Kerala , posted an article entitled " Cometary panspermia explains the red rain of Kerala " in the non @-@ peer reviewed arXiv web site . While the CESS report said there was no apparent relationship between the loud sound ( possibly a sonic boom ) and flash of light which preceded the red rain , to Louis and Kumar it was a key piece of evidence . They proposed that a meteor ( from a comet containing the red particles ) caused the sound and flash and when it disintegrated over Kerala it released the red particles which slowly fell to the ground . However , they omitted an explanation on how debris from a meteor continued to fall in the same area over a period of two months while unaffected by winds . 
 Their work indicated that the particles were of biological origin ( consistent with the CESS report ) , however , they invoked the panspermia hypothesis to explain the presence of cells in a supposed fall of meteoric material . Additionally , using <unk> bromide they were unable to detect DNA or RNA in the particles . Two months later they posted another paper on the same web site entitled " New biology of red rain extremophiles prove cometary panspermia " in which they reported that 
 " The microorganism isolated from the red rain of Kerala shows very extraordinary characteristics , like the ability to grow optimally at 300 ° C ( 572 ° F ) and the capacity to metabolise a wide range of organic and inorganic materials . " 
 These claims and data have yet to be verified and reported in any peer reviewed publication . In 2006 Louis and Kumar published a paper in Astrophysics and Space Science entitled " The red rain phenomenon of Kerala and its possible extraterrestrial origin " which reiterated their arguments that the red rain was biological matter from an extraterrestrial source but made no mention of their previous claims to having induced the cells to grow . The team also observed the cells using phase contrast fluorescence microscopy , and they concluded that : " The fluorescence behaviour of the red cells is shown to be in remarkable correspondence with the extended red emission observed in the Red Rectangle Nebula and other galactic and extragalactic dust clouds , suggesting , though not proving an extraterrestrial origin . " One of their conclusions was that if the red rain particles are biological cells and are of cometary origin , then this phenomenon can be a case of cometary panspermia . 
 In August 2008 Louis and Kumar again presented their case in an astrobiology conference . The abstract for their paper states that 
 " The red cells found in the red rain in Kerala , India are now considered as a possible case of extraterrestrial life form . These cells can undergo rapid replication even at an extreme high temperature of 300 ° C. They can also be cultured in diverse unconventional chemical substrates . The molecular composition of these cells is yet to be identified " . 
 In September 2010 he presented a similar paper at a conference in California , USA 
 = = = Cosmic ancestry = = = 
 Researcher Chandra Wickramasinghe used Louis and Kumar 's " extraterrestrial origin " claim to further support his panspermia hypothesis called cosmic ancestry . This hypothesis postulates that life is neither the product of supernatural creation , nor is it spontaneously generated through abiogenesis , but that it has always existed in the universe . Cosmic ancestry speculates that higher life forms , including intelligent life , descend ultimately from pre @-@ existing life which was at least as advanced as the descendants . 
 = = = Criticism = = = 
 Louis and Kumar made their first publication of their finding on a web site in 2003 , and have presented papers at conferences and in astrophysics magazines a number of times since . The controversial conclusion of Louis et al. is the only hypothesis suggesting that these organisms are of extraterrestrial origin . Such reports have been popular in the media , with major news agencies like CNN repeating the panspermia theory without critique . 
 The hypothesis ' authors – G. Louis and Kumar – did not explain how debris from a meteor could have continued to fall on the same area over a period of two months , despite the changes in climatic conditions and wind pattern spanning over two months . Samples of the red particles were also sent for analysis to his collaborators Milton Wainwright at Sheffield University and Chandra Wickramasinghe at Cardiff University . Louis then incorrectly reported on 29 August 2010 in the non @-@ peer reviewed online physics archive " <unk> " that they were able to have these cells " reproduce " when incubated at high pressure saturated steam at 121 ° C ( autoclaved ) for up to two hours . Their conclusion is that these cells reproduced , without DNA , at temperatures higher than any known life form on earth is able to . They claimed that the cells , however , were unable to reproduce at temperatures similar to known organisms . 
 Regarding the " absence " of DNA , Louis admits he has no training in biology , and has not reported the use of any standard microbiology growth medium to culture and induce germination and growth of the spores , basing his claim of " biological growth " on light absorption measurements following aggregation by supercritical fluids , an inert physical observation . Both his collaborators , Wickramasinghe and Milton Wainwright independently extracted and confirmed the presence of DNA from the spores . The absence of DNA was key to Louis and Kumar 's hypothesis that the cells were of extraterrestrial origins . 
 Louis ' only reported attempt to stain the spores ' DNA was by the use of malachite green , which is generally used to stain bacterial endospores , not algal spores , whose primary function of their cell wall and their impermeability is to ensure its own survival through periods of environmental stress . They are therefore resistant to ultraviolet and gamma radiation , desiccation , lysozyme , temperature , starvation and chemical disinfectants . Visualizing algal spore DNA under a light microscope can be difficult due to the impermeability of the highly resistant spore wall to dyes and stains used in normal staining procedures . The spores ' DNA is tightly packed , encapsulated and desiccated , therefore , the spores must first be cultured in suitable growth medium and temperature to first induce germination , then cell growth followed by reproduction before staining the DNA . 
 Other researchers have noted recurring instances of red rainfalls in 1818 , 1846 , 1872 , 1880 , 1896 , and 1950 , including one described by Charles Darwin , and several times since then . Most recently , coloured rainfall occurred over Kerala during the summers of 2001 , 2006 , 2007 , 2008 , and 2012 ; since 2001 , the botanists have found the same Trentepohlia spores every time . This supports the notion that the red rain is a seasonal local environmental feature caused by algal spores .

 = Harald Hardrada = 
 Harald Sigurdsson ( Old Norse : Haraldr Sigurðarson ; c . 1015 – 25 September 1066 ) , given the epithet Hardrada ( <unk> , roughly translated as " stern counsel " or " hard ruler " ) in the sagas , was King of Norway ( as Harald III ) from 1046 to 1066 . In addition , he unsuccessfully claimed the Danish throne until 1064 and the English throne in 1066 . Prior to becoming king , Harald had spent around fifteen years in exile as a mercenary and military commander in Kievan Rus ' and of the Varangian Guard in the Byzantine Empire . 
 When he was fifteen years old , in 1030 , Harald fought in the Battle of Stiklestad together with his half @-@ brother Olaf Haraldsson ( later Saint Olaf ) . Olaf sought to reclaim the Norwegian throne , which he had lost to the Danish king Cnut the Great two years prior . In the battle , Olaf and Harald were defeated by forces loyal to Cnut , and Harald was forced into exile to Kievan Rus ' ( the sagas ' Garðaríki ) . He thereafter spent some time in the army of Grand Prince Yaroslav the Wise , eventually obtaining rank as a captain , until he moved on to Constantinople with his companions around 1034 . In Constantinople , he soon rose to become the commander of the Byzantine Varangian Guard , and saw action on the Mediterranean Sea , in Asia Minor , Sicily , possibly in the Holy Land , Bulgaria and in Constantinople itself , where he became involved in the imperial dynastic disputes . Harald amassed considerable wealth during his time in the Byzantine Empire , which he shipped to Yaroslav in Kievan Rus ' for safekeeping . He finally left the Byzantines in 1042 , and arrived back in Kievan Rus ' in order to prepare his campaign of reclaiming the Norwegian throne . Possibly to Harald 's knowledge , in his absence the Norwegian throne had been restored from the Danes to Olaf 's illegitimate son Magnus the Good . 
 In 1046 , Harald joined forces with Magnus 's rival in Denmark ( Magnus had also become king of Denmark ) , the pretender Sweyn II of Denmark , and started raiding the Danish coast . Magnus , unwilling to fight his uncle , agreed to share the kingship with Harald , since Harald in turn would share his wealth with him . The co @-@ rule ended abruptly the next year as Magnus died , and Harald thus became the sole ruler of Norway . Domestically , Harald crushed all local and regional opposition , and outlined the territorial unification of Norway under a national governance . Harald 's reign was probably one of relative peace and stability , and he instituted a viable coin economy and foreign trade . Probably seeking to restore Cnut 's " North Sea Empire " , Harald also claimed the Danish throne , and spent nearly every year until 1064 raiding the Danish coast and fighting his former ally , Sweyn . Although the campaigns were successful , he was never able to conquer Denmark . Not long after renouncing his claim to Denmark , the former Earl of Northumbria , Tostig Godwinson , brother of the newly chosen English king Harold Godwinson , pledged his allegiance to Harald and invited him to claim the English throne . Harald went along and entered Northern England in September 1066 , raided the coast and defeated English regional forces in the Battle of Fulford near York . Although initially successful , Harald was defeated and killed in an attack by Harold Godwinson 's forces in the Battle of Stamford Bridge . 
 Modern historians have often considered Harald 's death at Stamford Bridge , which brought an end to his invasion , as the end of the Viking Age . Harald is also commonly held to have been the last great Viking king , or even the last great Viking . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Harald was born in Ringerike , Norway in 1015 ( or possibly 1016 ) to Åsta <unk> and her second husband Sigurd Syr . Sigurd was a petty king of Ringerike , and among the strongest and wealthiest chieftains in the Uplands . Through his mother Åsta , Harald was the youngest of King Olaf Haraldsson 's ( later Saint Olaf ) three half @-@ brothers . In his youth , Harald displayed traits of a typical rebel with big ambitions , and admired Olaf as his role model . He thus differed from his two older brothers , who were more similar to their father , down @-@ to @-@ earth and mostly concerned with maintaining the farm . 
 The Icelandic sagas , in particular Snorri Sturluson in Heimskringla , claim that Sigurd , like Olaf 's father , was a great @-@ grandson of King Harald Fairhair in the male line . Most modern scholars believe that the ancestors attributed to Harald Hardrada 's father , along with other parts of the Fairhair genealogy , are inventions reflecting the political and social expectations of the time of the authors ( around two centuries after Harald Hardrada 's lifetime ) rather than historical reality . Harald Hardrada 's alleged descent from Harald Fairhair is not mentioned and played no part during Harald Hardrada 's own time , which seems odd considering that it would have provided significant legitimacy in connection with his claim to the Norwegian throne . 
 Following a revolt in 1028 , Harald 's brother Olaf was forced into exile until he returned to Norway in early 1030 . On hearing news of Olaf 's planned return , Harald gathered 600 men from the Uplands to meet Olaf and his men upon their arrival in the east of Norway . After a friendly welcome , Olaf went on to gather an army and eventually fight in the Battle of Stiklestad on 29 July 1030 , in which Harald took part on his brother 's side . The battle was part of an attempt to restore Olaf to the Norwegian throne , which had been captured by the Danish king Cnut the Great . The battle resulted in defeat for the brothers at the hands of those Norwegians who were loyal to Cnut , and Olaf was killed while Harald was badly wounded . Harald was nonetheless remarked to have shown considerable military talent during the battle . 
 = = Exile in the East = = 
 = = = To Kievan Rus ' = = = 
 After the defeat at the Battle of Stiklestad , Harald managed to escape with the aid of Rögnvald <unk> ( later Earl of Orkney ) to a remote farm in Eastern Norway . He stayed there for some time to heal his wounds , and thereafter ( possibly up to a month later ) journeyed north over the mountains to Sweden . A year after the Battle of Stiklestad , Harald arrived in Kievan Rus ' ( referred to in the sagas as Garðaríki or <unk> hin <unk> ) . He likely spent at least part of his time in the town of Staraya Ladoga ( <unk> ) , arriving there in the first half of 1031 . Harald and his men were welcomed by Grand Prince Yaroslav the Wise , whose wife Ingegerd was a distant relative of Harald . Badly in need of military leaders , Yaroslav recognised a military potential in Harald and made him a captain of his forces . Harald 's brother Olaf Haraldsson had previously been in exile to Yaroslav following the revolt in 1028 , and Morkinskinna says that Yaroslav embraced Harald first and foremost because he was the brother of Olaf . Harald took part in Yaroslav 's campaign against the Poles in 1031 , and possibly also fought against other 1030s Kievan enemies and rivals such as the <unk> in Estonia , the Byzantines , as well as the Pechenegs and other steppe nomad people . 
 = = = In Byzantine service = = = 
 After a few years in Kievan Rus ' , Harald and his force of around 500 men moved on south to Constantinople ( <unk> ) , the capital of the Byzantine Empire , probably in 1033 or 1034 , where they joined the Varangian Guard . Although the <unk> maintains that Harald at first sought to keep his royal identity a secret , most sources agree that Harald and his men 's reputation was well known in the east at the time . While the Varangian Guard was primarily meant to function as the emperor 's bodyguard , Harald was found fighting on " nearly every frontier " of the empire . He first saw action in campaigns against Arab pirates in the Mediterranean , and then in inland towns in Asia Minor that had supported the pirates . By this time , he had according to Snorri Sturluson become the " leader over all the Varangians " . By 1035 , the Byzantines had pushed the Arabs out of Asia Minor , and Harald took part in campaigns that went as far east as the Euphrates , where according to his skald Þjóðólfr <unk> ( recounted in the sagas ) he participated in the capture of eighty Arab strongholds , a number which historians <unk> Blöndal and Benedikt Benedikz see no particular reason to question . Although not holding independent command of an army as the sagas imply , it is not unlikely that Harald and the Varangians at times could have been sent off to capture a castle or town . During the first four years of the reign of Byzantine Emperor Michael IV , Harald probably also fought in campaigns against the Pechenegs . 
 Thereafter , Harald is reported in the sagas to have gone to Jerusalem and fought in battles in the area . Although the sagas place this after his expedition to Sicily , historian Kelly DeVries has questioned that chronology . Whether his trip was of a military or peaceful nature would depend on whether it took place before or after the 1036 peace treaty between Michael IV and the Fatimid Caliph Ma 'ad al @-@ Mustansir Billah ( in reality the Caliph 's mother , originally a Byzantine Christian , since the Caliph was a minor ) , although it is considered unlikely to have been made before . Modern historians have speculated that Harald may have been in a party sent to escort pilgrims to Jerusalem ( possibly including members of the Imperial family ) following the peace agreement , as it was also agreed that the Byzantines were allowed to repair the Church of the Holy Sepulchre . Furthermore , this may in turn have presented Harald with opportunities to fight against bandits who preyed on Christian pilgrims . 
 In 1038 , Harald joined the Byzantines in their expedition to Sicily , in George Maniakes 's ( the sagas ' " <unk> " ) attempt to reconquer the island from the Saracens , who had established the Emirate of Sicily on the island . During the campaign , Harald fought alongside Norman mercenaries such as William Iron Arm . According to Snorri Sturluson , Harald captured four towns on Sicily . In 1041 , when the Byzantine expedition to Sicily was over , a Lombard @-@ Norman revolt erupted in southern Italy , and Harald led the Varangian Guard in multiple battles . Harald fought with the Catepan of Italy , Michael Dokeianos with initial success , but the Normans , led by their former ally William Iron Arm , defeated the Byzantines in the Battle of <unk> in March , and in the Battle of <unk> in May . After the defeat , Harald and the Varangian Guard were called back to Constantinople , following Maniakes ' imprisonment by the emperor and the onset of other more pressing issues . Harald and the Varangians were thereafter sent to fight in Bulgaria , where they arrived in late 1041 . There , he fought in the army of Michael IV in the 1041 campaign against the Bulgarian uprising led by Peter Delyan , which later gained Harald the nickname the " Bulgar @-@ burner " ( <unk> <unk> ) by his skald . 
 Harald was not affected by Maniakes ' conflict with Michael IV , and received honours and respect upon his return to Constantinople . In a Greek book written in the 1070s , the Strategikon of Kekaumenos , <unk> ( i.e. Harald ) is said to have won the favour of the emperor . The book says that the Byzantine emperor first appointed him manglabites ( possibly identified with the title protospatharios ) , a soldier of the imperial guard , after the Sicilian campaign . Following the campaign against the Bulgarians , in which Harald again served with distinction , he received the rank while at Mosynopolis of <unk> , identified by DeVries as a promotion to the possibly third highest Byzantine rank , but by Mikhail <unk> as a lesser rank than protospatharios that was ordinarily awarded to foreign allies to the emperor . The Strategikon indicates that the ranks awarded to Harald were rather low , since Harald reportedly was " not angry for just having been appointed to manglabites or <unk> " . According to his skald <unk> <unk> , Harald had participated in eighteen greater battles during his Byzantine service . Harald 's favour at the imperial court quickly declined after the death of Michael IV in December 1041 , which was followed by conflicts between the new emperor Michael V and the powerful empress Zoe . 
 During the turmoil , Harald was arrested and imprisoned , but the sources disagree on the grounds . The sagas state that Harald was arrested for defrauding the emperor of his treasure , as well as for requesting marriage with an apparently fictional niece or granddaughter of Zoe , called Maria ( his suit supposedly being turned down by the empress because she wanted to marry Harald herself ) . William of Malmesbury states that Harald was arrested for defiling a noble woman , while according to Saxo Grammaticus he was imprisoned for murder . DeVries suggests that the new emperor may have feared Harald because of his loyalty to the previous emperor . The sources also disagree on how Harald got out of prison , but he may have been helped by someone outside to escape in the midst of the revolt that had begun against the new emperor . While some of the Varangians helped guard the emperor , Harald became the leader of the Varangians who supported the revolt . The emperor was in the end dragged out of his sanctuary , blinded and exiled to a monastery , and the sagas claim that it was Harald himself who blinded Michael V ( or at least claimed to have done so ) . 
 = = = Back to Kievan Rus ' = = = 
 Harald became extremely rich during his time in the east , and secured the wealth collected in Constantinople by shipments to Kievan Rus ' for safekeeping ( with Yaroslav the Wise acting as <unk> for his fortune ) . The sagas note that aside from the significant spoils of battle he had retained , he had participated three times in <unk> ( loosely translated as " palace @-@ plunder " ) , a term which implies either the pillaging of the palace exchequer on the death of the emperor , or perhaps the disbursement of funds to the Varangians by the new emperor in order to ensure their loyalty . It is likely that the money Harald made while serving in Constantinople allowed him to fund his claim for the crown of Norway . If he participated in <unk> three times , these occasions must have been the deaths of Romanos III , Michael IV , and Michael V , in which Harald would have opportunities , beyond his legitimate revenues , to carry off immense wealth . 
 After Zoe had been restored to the throne in June 1042 together with Constantine IX , Harald requested to be allowed to return to Norway . Although Zoe refused to allow this , Harald managed to escape into the Bosphorus with two ships and some loyal followers . Although the second ship was destroyed by the Byzantine cross @-@ strait iron chains , Harald 's ship sailed safely into the Black Sea after successfully manoeuvring over the barrier . Despite this , Kekaumenos lauds the " loyalty and love " Harald had for the empire , which he reportedly maintained even after he returned to Norway and became king . Following his escape from Constantinople , Harald arrived back in Kievan Rus ' later in 1042 . During his second stay there , he married Elisabeth ( referred to in Scandinavian sources as <unk> ) , daughter of Yaroslav the Wise and granddaughter of the Swedish king Olof Skötkonung . Shortly after Harald 's arrival in Kiev , Yaroslav attacked Constantinople , and it is considered likely that Harald provided him with valuable information about the state of the empire . 
 It is possible that the marriage with Elisiv had been agreed to already during Harald 's first time in Rus ' , or that they at least had been acquainted . During his service in the Byzantine Empire , Harald composed a love poem which included the verse " Yet the goddess in Russia / will not accept my gold rings " ( whom Snorri Sturluson identifies with Elisiv ) , although Morkinskinna claims that Harald had to remind Yaroslav of the promised marriage when he returned to Kiev . According to the same source , Harald had spoken with Yaroslav during his first time in Rus ' , requesting to marry Elisiv , only to be rejected because he was not yet wealthy enough . It is in any case significant that Harald was allowed to marry the daughter of Yaroslav , since his other children were married to figures such as Henry I of France , Andrew I of Hungary and the daughter of Constantine IX .

 Seeking to regain for himself the kingdom lost by his half @-@ brother Olaf Haraldsson , Harald began his journey westwards in early 1045 , departing from Novgorod ( <unk> ) to Staraya Ladoga ( <unk> ) where he obtained a ship . His journey went through Lake Ladoga , down the Neva River , and then into the Gulf of Finland and the Baltic Sea . He arrived in <unk> in Sweden , probably at the end of 1045 or in early 1046 . When he arrived in Sweden , according to the skald <unk> <unk> , his ship was unbalanced by its heavy load of gold . In Harald 's absence , the throne of Norway had been restored to Magnus the Good , an illegitimate son of Olaf . Harald may actually have known this , and it could have been the reason why Harald wanted to return to Norway in the first place . Since Cnut the Great 's sons had chosen to abandon Norway and instead fight over England , and his sons and successors Harold Harefoot and Harthacnut had died young , Magnus 's position as king had been secured . No domestic threats or insurrections are recorded to have occurred during his eleven @-@ year reign . After the death of Harthacnut , which had left the Danish throne vacant , Magnus had in addition been selected to be the king of Denmark , and managed to defeat the Danish royal pretender Sweyn Estridsson . 
 Having heard of Sweyn 's defeat by Magnus , Harald met up with his fellow exile in Sweden ( who was also his nephew ) , as well as with the Swedish king <unk> Jacob , and the three joined forces against Magnus . Their first military exploit consisted of raiding the Danish coast , in an effort to impress the natives by demonstrating that Magnus offered them no protection , and thus leading them to submit to Harald and Sweyn . Learning about their actions , Magnus knew that their next target would be Norway . Harald may have planned to be taken as king of his father 's petty kingdom , and thereafter claim the rest of the country . In any case , the people were unwilling to turn against Magnus , and on hearing news of Harald 's schemes , Magnus ( abroad at the time ) went home to Norway with his entire army . Instead of going to war , Magnus 's advisors recommended the young king not fight his uncle , and a compromise was reached in 1046 in which Harald would rule Norway ( not Denmark ) jointly with Magnus ( although Magnus would have precedence ) . Notably , Harald also had to agree to share half of his wealth with Magnus , who at the time was effectively bankrupt and badly in need of funds . During their short co @-@ rule , Harald and Magnus had separate courts and kept to themselves , and their only recorded meetings nearly ended in physical clashes . 
 In 1047 , Magnus and Harald went to Denmark with their leidang forces . Later that year in Jylland , less than a year into their co @-@ rule , Magnus died without an heir . Before his death , he had decided that Sweyn was to inherit Denmark and Harald to inherit Norway . On hearing the news of Magnus 's death , Harald quickly gathered the local leaders in Norway and declared himself king of Norway as well as of Denmark . Although Magnus had appointed Sweyn his successor as king of Denmark , Harald immediately announced his plans to gather an army and oust his former ally from the country . In response , the army and the chieftains , headed by Einar <unk> , opposed any plans of invading Denmark . Although Harald himself objected to bringing the body of Magnus back to Norway , the Norwegian army prepared to transport his body to Nidaros ( now Trondheim ) , where they buried him next to Saint Olaf in late 1047 . Einar , an opponent of Harald , claimed that " to follow Magnus dead was better than to follow any other king alive " . 
 = = = Invasions of Denmark = = = 
 Harald also wanted to re @-@ establish Magnus 's rule over Denmark , and in the long term probably sought to restore Cnut the Great 's " North Sea Empire " in its entirety . While his first proposal to invade Denmark fell through , the next year Harald embarked on what would turn into constant warfare against Sweyn , from 1048 almost yearly until 1064 . Similar to his campaigns ( then together with Sweyn ) against Magnus 's rule in Denmark , most of his campaigns against Sweyn consisted of swift and violent raids on the Danish coasts . In 1048 , he plundered Jutland , and in 1049 he pillaged and burned Hedeby , at the time the most important Danish trade center , and one of the best protected and most populous towns in Scandinavia . Hedeby as a civil town never recovered from Harald 's destruction , and was left completely desolate when what remained was looted by Slavic tribes in 1066 . One of two conventional battles was set to be fought between the two kings later the same year , but according to Saxo Grammaticus , Sweyn 's smaller army was so frightened when approached by the Norwegians that they chose to jump in the water trying to escape ; most drowned . Although Harald was victorious in most of the engagements , he was never successful in occupying Denmark . 
 The second , more significant battle , a naval encounter , was the Battle of Niså on 9 August 1062 . As Harald had not been able to conquer Denmark despite his raids , he wanted to win a decisive victory over Sweyn . He eventually set out from Norway with a great army and a fleet of around 300 ships . Sweyn had also prepared for the battle , which had been <unk> a time and place . Sweyn , did not appear at the agreed time , and Harald thus sent home his non @-@ professional soldiers ( <unk> ) , which had made up half of his forces . When the dismissed ships were out of reach , Sweyn 's fleet finally appeared , possibly also with 300 ships . The battle resulted in great bloodshed as Harald defeated the Danes ( 70 Danish ships were reportedly left " empty " ) , but many ships and men managed to escape , including Sweyn . During the battle , Harald actively used his bow as an archer , like most others in the early phase of the battle . 
 Fatigue and the huge cost of the indecisive battles eventually led Harald to seek peace with Sweyn , and in 1064 ( or 1065 according to Morkinskinna ) the two kings agreed on an unconditional peace agreement . By the agreement , they retained their respective kingdoms with the former boundaries , and there would be no payments of reparations . In the subsequent winter of 1065 , Harald travelled through his realm and accused the farmers of withholding taxes from him . In response , he acted with brutality , and had peopled maimed and killed as a warning to those who disobeyed him . Harald maintained control of his nation through the use of his hird , a private standing army maintained by Norwegian lords . Harald 's contribution to the strengthening of Norway 's monarchy was the enforcement of a policy that only the king could retain a hird , thus centralising power away from local warlords . 
 = = = Domestic opposition = = = 
 According to historian Knut Helle , Harald completed the first phase of what he has termed the " national territorial unification of Norway " . Having forced his way to the kingship , Harald would have to convince the aristocracy that he was the right person to rule Norway alone . To establish domestic alliances , he married Tora Torbergsdatter of one of the most powerful Norwegian families . The primary opposition to Harald 's rule would be the descendants of Haakon Sigurdsson , from the powerful dynasty of Earls of Lade who had controlled Northern Norway and Trøndelag with much autonomy under the Norwegian king . Haakon had even ruled the whole of Norway ( nominally under the Danish king ) from 975 until 995 , when he was killed during the takeover by Olaf Tryggvasson . Even after Haakon 's death , his offspring held a certain degree of sovereignty in the north , and by Harald 's early reign the family was headed by Einar <unk> , who was married to Haakon 's daughter . While the family had maintained good relations with Magnus , Harald 's absolutism and consolidation of the kingship soon led to conflict with Einar . 
 It was from his power @-@ struggle with the Norwegian aristocracy that Harald got himself the reputation that gave him the nickname " Hardrada " , or " the hard ruler " . Although the relationship between Harald and Einar was poor from the start , confrontation did not occur before Harald went north to his court in Nidaros . One time in Nidaros , Einar arrived at Harald 's court , and in a display of power was accompanied by " eight or nine longships and almost five hundred men " , obviously seeking confrontation . Harald was not provoked by the incident . Although the sources differ on the circumstances , the next event nonetheless led to the murder of Einar by Harald 's men , which threatened to throw Norway into a state of civil war . Although the remaining descendants of Haakon Sigurdsson considered rebellion against the king , Harald eventually managed to negotiate peace with them , and secured the family 's submission for the remainder of his reign . By the death of Einar and his son around 1050 , the Earls of Lade had outplayed their role as a base of opposition , and Trøndelag was definitely subordinated to Harald 's national kingdom . 
 Before the Battle of Niså , Harald had been joined by Haakon Ivarsson , who distinguished himself in the battle and gained Harald 's favour . Reportedly even considering to give him the title of Earl , Haakon was greatly upset when Harald later backed down from his promise . With a strong hold over the Uplands , Haakon was additionally given the earldom of Värmland by the Swedish king <unk> . In early 1064 , Haakon entered the Uplands and collected their taxes , the region thus effectively threatening to renounce their loyalty to Harald . The revolt of Haakon and the farmers in the Uplands may have been the main reason why Harald finally had been willing to enter a peace agreement with Sweyn Estridsson . After the agreement , Harald went to Oslo and sent tax collectors to the Uplands , only to find that the farmers would withhold their taxes until Haakon arrived . In response , Harald entered Sweden with an army and quickly defeated Haakon . Still facing opposition from the farmers , Harald embarked on a campaign to crush the areas that had withheld their taxes . Due to the remote location of the region in the interior of the country , the Uplands had never been an integrated part of the Norwegian king 's realm . Using harsh measures , Harald burned down farms and small villages , and had people maimed and killed . Starting in Romerike , his campaign continued into Hedmark , <unk> and Ringerike . Since the regions contained several rich rural communities , Harald strengthened his economic position by confiscating farming estates . By the end of 1065 there was probably peace in Norway , as any opposition had either been killed , chased into exile or silenced . 
 = = = Policies = = = 
 Harald 's reign was marked by his background as a military commander , as he often solved disputes with harsh force . One of his skalds even boasted about how Harald broke settlements he had made , in his battles in the Mediterranean . While the sagas largely focus on Harald 's war with Sweyn and the invasion of England , little is said about his domestic policies . Modern historians have taken this as a sign that , despite his absolutism , his reign was one of peace and progress for Norway . Harald is considered to have instituted good economic policies , as he developed a Norwegian currency and a viable coin economy , which in turn allowed Norway to participate in international trade . He initiated trade with Kievan Rus ' and the Byzantine Empire through his connections , as well as with Scotland and Ireland . According to the later sagas , Harald founded Oslo , where he spent much time . 
 Harald also continued to advance Christianity in Norway , and archaeological excavations show that churches were built and improved during his reign . He also imported bishops , priests and monks from abroad , especially from Kievan Rus ' and the Byzantine Empire . A slightly different form of Christianity was thus introduced in Norway from the rest of northern Europe , although it should be noted that the East – West Schism had not yet taken place . Since the clergy was not ordained in England or France , it nonetheless caused controversy when Harald was visited by papal legates . The protests by the legates led Harald to throw the Catholic clergy out of his court , and he reportedly stated to the legates that " he did not know of any other archbishop or lord of Norway than the king himself " . Norwegian historian Halvdan Koht has remarked that the " words seemed as if spoken by a Byzantine despot " . It is possible that Harald maintained contacts with Byzantine emperors after he became king , which could suggest a background for his church policies . 
 = = = Northern explorations = = = 
 Once he had returned to Norway , Harald seems to have displayed an interest in exploring his own realm , as for instance the Morkinskinna recounts Harald 's trip into the Uplands . Harald is also said to have explored the seas beyond his kingdom , as the contemporary Adam of Bremen reports of such naval expeditions conducted by Harald : 
 Kelly DeVries has suggested that Harald " may even have known of and sought out the legendary land called Vinland , which Viking sailors had discovered only a short time before " , which Adam mentions earlier in the same passage to have been widely reported in Denmark and Norway . H. H. Lamb has on the other hand proposed that the land he reached may have been either Spitsbergen or Novaya Zemlya . 
 = = Invasion of England = = 
 = = = Background and preparations = = = 
 With the truce and the recognition that he would not conquer Denmark , Harald turned his attention to England . England had belonged to Harthacnut , the son of Cnut the Great , until he died childless in 1042 . Harald based his claim to the throne of England on an agreement made between Magnus and Harthacnut in 1038 , which stated that if either died , the other would inherit the throne and lands of the deceased . When Harthacnut died , Magnus assumed the crown of Denmark and considered himself the lawful heir to Harthacnut . While Edward the Confessor had himself crowned English king in his absence , Magnus had planned to invade England in 1045 , only to be forced to turn his fleet towards Denmark due to an uprising by Sweyn Estridsson . Although the threat was temporarily averted by Magnus 's death in 1047 , Edward 's negotiations with his enemies throughout the 1050s gave Harald ( as well as Sweyn Estridsson and William of Normandy ) an impression that he was a possible heir to Edward . When Edward died in January 1066 , he was to Harald 's dismay succeeded by Harold Godwinson , a son of one of Edward 's advisors . 
 Harald 's son Magnus had previously been involved in Gruffydd ap Llywelyn 's 1058 war against the English king with a Norwegian fleet , possibly indicating that Harald had tested the situation in England long before his 1066 invasion , only to find that he could not simultaneously be at war with Denmark and England . After Edward 's death , Harald allied himself with Tostig Godwinson , Harold 's brother , who had been deprived of the earldom of Northumbria by Edward in 1065 . According to various sources , Tostig may have asked both or either of William of Normandy and Sweyn Estridsson to assist him in invading England before turning to Harald . According to the sagas , Tostig finally pledged his support for Harald , including that of the " majority of the chieftains " , at a meeting in Norway . Some historians doubt that this meeting took place , as William of Malmesbury claims that Tostig did not pledge his support for Harald until they met at the Humber . This would indicate that the invasion originally was Harald 's plan alone , and that his joining of forces with Tostig was merely a later agreement when the two met for the first time in Scotland or Northumbria . Another proposal by historians is that a meeting did indeed take place in Norway , but instead with <unk> , one of Tostig 's early supporters and a fellow exile , as Tostig 's mediator . If this is correct , it would both allow an agreement to have been made in Norway , and the first personal meeting between Harald and Tostig to have taken place in Britain . Indeed , Morkinskinna mentions that " some men " claimed that Tostig only had sent an emissary to Norway , while he still remained in France . 
 The plans for the invasion were in any case completed by the start of September 1066 , and had possibly begun already in March or April . While he brought with him Elisiv , his daughters , and his son Olaf , he left behind Tora and made sure to have his oldest son Magnus hailed as king . Gathering his fleet at <unk> in the Sognefjord , Harald departed Norway in August , and landed first in Shetland and thereafter in Orkney ( both under Norwegian control ) . In both places he was joined by several important lords , chieftains , and soldiers , including the Earls of Orkney , Paul and Erlend Thorfinnsson . He next went to Dunfermline , where he met with Tostig 's ally Malcolm III of Scotland ( and according to some sources , with Tostig ) who allocated him a couple thousand Scottish soldiers . According to most contemporary sources , Harald and Tostig met at Tynemouth on 8 September , Harald with a total force of , at the most , around 10 – 15 @,@ 000 men on 240 – 300 longships , and Tostig with a mere 12 ships with soldiers . Not mentioned in the sagas , but accounted for by John of Worcester , Tostig had departed from his exile in Flanders already in May or June . He had then raided villages along the southern coast of Britain from the Isle of Wight to Sandwich . As Harold Godwinson gathered a large army in response , Tostig sailed north to meet with Harald , while Harold Godwinson remained in the south in expectation of invasion by William of Normandy , who for a long time had openly claimed the English throne . 
 = = = Invasion and the Battle of Stamford Bridge = = = 
 After embarking from Tynemouth , Harald and Tostig probably landed at the River Tees . They then entered Cleveland , and started plundering the coast . They encountered the first resistance at Scarborough , where Harald 's demand for surrender was opposed . In the end , Harald resorted to burning down the town and this action led to other Northumbrian towns surrendering to him . After further raiding , Harald and Tostig sailed down the Humber , disembarking at Riccall . News of the invasion soon reached the earls Morcar of Northumbria and Edwin of Mercia , and they fought against Harald 's invading army two miles ( 3 km ) south of York at the Battle of Fulford on 20 September . The battle was a decisive victory for Harald and Tostig , and led York to surrender to their forces on 24 September . This would be the last time a Scandinavian army defeated English forces . The same day as York surrendered to Harald and Tostig , Harold Godwinson arrived with his army in Tadcaster , just seven miles from the anchored Norwegian fleet at Riccall . From there , he probably scouted the Norwegian fleet , preparing a surprise attack . As Harald had left no forces in York , Harold Godwinson marched right through the town to Stamford Bridge . 
 Early on 25 September , Harald and Tostig departed their landing place at Riccall with most of their forces , but left a third of their forces behind . They brought only light armour , as they expected to just meet the citizens of York , as they had agreed the day before , at Stamford Bridge to decide on who should manage the town under Harald . Once there Harald saw Godwinson 's forces approaching , heavily armed and armoured , and greatly outnumbering Harald 's . Although ( according to non @-@ saga sources ) the English forces were held up at the bridge for some time by a single Norwegian , allowing Harald and Tostig to regroup into a shield @-@ wall formation , Harald 's army was in the end heavily beaten . Harald was struck in the throat by an arrow and killed early in the battle in a state of <unk> , having worn no body armour and fought aggressively with both hands around his sword . 
 When the battle was almost over , some reserve forces from Riccall led by Eystein Orre finally appeared , but they were exhausted as they had run all the way . Eystein picked up Harald 's fallen banner , the " <unk> " ( Landøyðan ) , and initiated a final counter @-@ attack . Although they for a moment appeared to almost breach the English line , Eystein was suddenly killed , which left the rest of the men to flee from the battlefield . Among those left at Riccall after the battle , who were allowed to return home peacefully by the English forces , was Harald 's son Olaf . Although sources state that Harald 's remaining army only filled 20 – 25 ships on the return to Norway , it is likely that this number only accounts for the Norwegian forces . Most of the forces from Scotland and Orkney probably remained at Riccall throughout the battle ( the earls Paul and Erlend Thorfinnsson are certainly known to have been stationed there the entire time ) , and has not been counted in the traditional figure . 
 Harold Godwinson 's victory was short @-@ lived , as only a few weeks later he was defeated by William the Conqueror at the Battle of Hastings . The fact that Harold had to make a forced march to fight Hardrada at Stamford Bridge and then move at utmost speed south to meet the Norman invasion , all in less than three weeks , is widely seen as a primary factor in William 's victory at Hastings . 
 = = Personal life = = 
 Harald is described by Snorri Sturluson to have been physically " larger than other men and stronger " . He is said to have had light hair and beard , a long " upper beard " ( moustache ) , and that one of his eyebrows was somewhat higher situated than the other . He also reportedly had big hands and feet , and could measure five ells in height . It is not known whether Snorri 's description of Harald 's physical appearance actually represents historical facts . The tall stature of Harald is also substantiated by a story that relates that before the Battle of Stamford Bridge , Harold Godwinson offered Tostig back the earldom of Northumbria , and Harald " six feet of the ground of England , or perhaps more seeing that he is taller than most men " ( according to Henry of Huntingdon ) or " six feet of English ground , or seven feet as he was taller than other men " ( according to Snorri Sturluson ) . 
 Harald himself composed skaldic poetry . According to Lee M. Hollander , composing poetry was normal for Norwegian kings , but Harald was the only one who " showed a decided talent . " According to one poem , Harald had mastered a number of activities that were considered sports in the Viking Age , including in addition to poetry , brewing , horse riding , swimming , skiing , shooting , rowing and playing the harp . The sagas state that Harald and his Varangians at least once took a break during the siege of a town to enjoy sports . 
 With regards to religion , Harald had , according to DeVries , a " religious inclination towards Christianity " and was " publicly close to the Christian Church " , although he was influenced by the Eastern Christian culture of Russia and the Byzantine Empire , having spent most of his life there . He was clearly interested in advancing Christianity in Norway , which can be seen by the continued building and improvement of churches throughout his reign . Despite this , DeVries notes that Harald 's " personal morality appears not to have matched the Christian ideal " , citing his marriage arrangements . 
 = = Issue = = 
 Harald married Elisiv of Kiev ( c . 1025 – after 1066 ) around 1044 / 45 , and they had an unknown number , possibly several children . According to Snorri Sturluson , they had two daughters : 
 Ingegerd ( c . 1050 – 1120 ) . Married first to the future Olaf I of Denmark , and after his death , to the future Philip of Sweden . 
 Maria ( died 25 September 1066 ) . Promised away for marriage to Eystein Orre ( brother of Tora Torbergsdatter ) , but reportedly died on Orkney the same day that Harald ( and Eystein ) died at Stamford Bridge . 
 According to the sagas , Harald married Tora Torbergsdatter ( c . 1025 – after 1066 ) around 1048 . Some modern historians have disputed this , since Harald in that case would be in a bigamous marriage , as he was still married to Elisiv . It is nonetheless possible that such a marriage could take place in Norway in the 11th century , and although Harald had two wives , only Elisiv is noted to have held the title of Queen . Harald and Tora had at least two children : 
 Magnus II ( c . 1049 – 1069 ) . <unk> as king of Norway from 1066 to 1069 . 
 Olaf III ( c . 1050 – 1093 ) . <unk> as king of Norway from 1067 to 1093 .

 A year after his death at Stamford Bridge , Harald 's body was moved to Norway and buried at the Mary Church in Nidaros ( Trondheim ) . About a hundred years after his burial , his body was reinterred at the <unk> Priory , which was demolished in the 17th century . On 25 September 2006 , the <unk> anniversary of Harald 's death , the newspaper Aftenposten published an article on the poor state of Norway 's ancient royal burial sites , including that of Harald , which is reportedly located underneath a road built across the monastery site . In a follow @-@ up article on 26 September , the Municipality of Trondheim revealed they would be examining the possibility of exhuming the king and <unk> him in Nidaros Cathedral , currently the burial place of nine Norwegian kings , among them Magnus the Good and Magnus Haraldsson , Harald 's predecessor and successor respectively . A month later it was reported that the proposal to exhume the king had been scrapped .

 Two monuments have been raised in honour of Harald in Oslo , the city which he is traditionally held to have founded . A bronze relief on granite by Lars Utne depicting Harald on horseback was raised on the eponymously named square Harald <unk> plass in 1905 . In 1950 , a large relief by Anne <unk> , also of Harald on horseback , was unveiled on the western façade of the Oslo City Hall .

 Harald appears in a number of historical fiction books . Justin Hill 's Viking Fire is the second in his Conquest Trilogy , and tells the life of Harald in his own voice . He serves as the protagonist in two children 's books by Henry Treece , The Last of the Vikings / The Last Viking ( 1964 ) and Swords from the North / The Northern Brothers ( 1967 ) . He also appears as the protagonist in the trilogy The Last Viking ( 1980 ) by Poul Anderson , and in Byzantium ( 1989 ) by Michael Ennis , which chronicles Harald 's career in the Byzantine Empire . 
 The alternative history book Crusader Gold ( 2007 ) by marine archeologist David Gibbins features Harald as a key figure , as it follows him in acquiring the lost Menorah among his treasures during his service in the Byzantine Varangian Guard . Harald also makes an appearances in <unk> ( 2005 ) by Tom Holt . 
 In film , Harald was portrayed by Richard Long in the first episode of the BBC series <unk> ( 2004 ) , titled " 1066 " , which explores the background of the Battle of Hastings . 
 Harald 's unorthodox departure from Constantinople is featured in music by the Finnish folk metal band Turisas in the song " The Great Escape " ; in addition , he is followed loosely throughout the story of the albums The Varangian Way ( 2007 ) and Stand Up and Fight ( 2011 ) . 
 = Cornelio Saavedra = 
 Cornelio Judas <unk> de Saavedra y Rodríguez ( September 15 , 1759 in <unk> – March 29 , 1829 in Buenos Aires ) was a military officer and statesman from the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata . He was instrumental in the May Revolution , the first step of Argentina 's independence from Spain , and was appointed president of the Primera Junta . 
 Saavedra was the first commanding officer of the Regiment of Patricians created after the ill @-@ fated British invasions of the Río de la Plata . The increased militarization of the city and the relaxation of the system of <unk> allowed him , as other criollo peoples , to become a prominent figure in local politics . His intervention was decisive to thwart the Mutiny of Álzaga and allow Viceroy Santiago de Liniers to stay in power . Although he supported the establishment of a government Junta , as others created in Spain during the contemporary Peninsular War , he desired that criollos had an important role in it ( the mutiny of Álzaga was promoted by peninsulars ) . He advised against rushed actions as well , and as his Regiment was crucial in any action against the viceroy , he denied his help until it was a good strategic moment to do so . The opportunity came in May , 1810 , and the May Revolution successfully ousted the viceroy . 
 Saavedra was appointed president of the Primera Junta , which took government after it . The local politics were soon divided between him and the secretary Mariano Moreno . Saavedra wanted gradual changes , while Moreno promoted more radical ones . Saavedra encouraged the expansion of the Junta with deputies from the other provinces ; this left Moreno in a minority , and he resigned . A later rebellion made in behalf of Saavedra forced the remaining supporters of Moreno to resign as well . He left the presidency after the defeat of the first Upper Peru campaign , and headed to lead the Army of the North . His absence was exploited by political opponents , who established the First Triumvirate and issued an arrest warrant against Saavedra . Saavedra stayed in exile until 1815 , when all the charges against him were dropped . 
 = = Biography = = 
 = = = Early life = = = 
 Saavedra was born at the hacienda " La <unk> " , located in the town of <unk> , near the former Imperial City of Potosí . The city was part of the Spanish Viceroyalty of Peru by that time , but would be annexed into the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata some years later . His father was Santiago Felipe de Saavedra y Palma , a native of Buenos Aires , whose ancestry reached to Hernando Arias de Saavedra . His mother was María Teresa Rodríguez Michel , a native of the Villa Imperial de Potosi . Santiago had left Buenos Aires and married María . They were a wealthy family , with many sons , Cornelio being the last one . The family moved to Buenos Aires in 1767 . There , during his adolescence , Cornelio attended the Real Colegio de San Carlos . The school was only for the elite , and to attend it was required to be allowed by the viceroy , know reading and writing , be at least ten years old , be a legitimate son and have certified limpieza de sangre ; Saavedra met all the requirements . He studied philosophy and Latin Grammar between 1773 and 1776 . However , he could not graduate due to overwhelming duties in the management of the family ranch . Unlike other rich youths of the time , he did not attend to university . 
 In 1788 , he married Maria Francisca Cabrera y Saavedra , his cousin . Francisca was rich , and it is likely that it was an arranged marriage . They had three sons , Diego , Mariano and Manuel . Francisca died in 1798 . Saavedra began his political career in 1797 , working at the Buenos Aires Cabildo , assuming various administrative roles . By then , the city had become the capital of the Viceroyalty of the Rio de la Plata . His first political appointment was as fourth alderman , and third alderman the following year . In 1801 , he was appointed Mayor of First Vote . That same year he married his second wife , Doña <unk> <unk> del Rivero . In 1805 , he was appointed to the position of Grain manager , within a local governmental body that dealt with the provision of wheat and other cereals in the city . It is considered that Saavedra supported the proposals of Manuel Belgrano at the Commerce Consulate of Buenos Aires , which promoted agriculture , education and industrialization , but there is no definitive evidence of it . 
 = = = The Regiment of Patricians = = = 
 Buenos Aires faced the British invasions of the Río de la Plata in 1806 , when British forces led by William Carr Beresford invaded the city . Saavedra was still a civilian by then . Santiago de Liniers organized an army in Montevideo to liberate Buenos Aires , and Saavedra was among the civilians that joined Liniers , despite the lack of military instruction . His role in this battle was a minor one . Liniers successfully liberated Buenos Aires , and organized the resistance against a likely British counter @-@ attack . All the male population of the city aged from 16 to 50 was drafted into the army , and divided in battalions by casta or origin . The largest one was the Regiment of Patricians , made up of volunteer infantrymen born in Buenos Aires . The Regiment was composed of three infantry battalions , commanded by Esteban Romero , Domingo Urien and Manuel Belgrano , who would later pass that command to Juan José Viamonte . Each battalion could elect their own leaders , including their commander , and the Regiment of Patricians elected Saavedra . 
 The British returned in 1807 . Cornelio Saavedra marched to Montevideo , but was informed at Colonia del Sacramento of the capture of the city . The British planned to use it as a lodgement for the invasion of Buenos Aires . To give difficulty to the British operations , Saavedra ordered the withdrawal of all military hardware from Colonia , considered indefensible at that point , and mobilized those troops and equipment to Buenos Aires to fortify the city . The renewed attack to Buenos Aires took place shortly afterwards , the invading army had 8 @,@ 000 soldiers and 18 cannons — significantly more than the 1 @,@ 565 men , 6 cannons and 2 howitzers used for the first British invasion attempt . After an initial victory in the pens of Miserere , the invading army entered into Buenos Aires on July 5 . 
 The British army encountered an extremely hostile population , prepared to resist to the degree that even women , children and slaves voluntarily participated in the defense . The headquarters of the Regiment of Patricians were located at the Real Colegio de San Carlos , where Saavedra and Juan José Viamonte stopped the column of Denis Pack and Henry Cadogan , composed of British infantry and a cannon . Pack united his remaining forces with Craufurd and resisted inside the Santo Domingo convent . Cadogan took the nearby house of Pedro Medrano , and fired from the rooftop . Both groups were finally defeated by the local soldiers . Finally , the British General John <unk> surrendered , ending the attack and pledging to withdraw all British forces from Montevideo . 
 The victory against the British invasions brought forth great changes in the politics of Buenos Aires . The viceroy Sobremonte was discredited by his management of the conflict , and the Cabildo increased its influence ; as such , it removed the viceroy and appointed Liniers as replacement , an unprecedented action . The local criollos , who had limited chances of social promotion in the system of <unk> , got such a chance with the increased influence of the militias . Cornelio Saavedra , head of the biggest <unk> militia , thus became a highly influential man in the politics of Buenos Aires . He resented the weak support from the Spanish monarchy to the war effort , compared with the strong one received from the cabildos of other cities in the Americas . As a result , he was loyal to the new viceroy , of French ancestry , considering him to be less subject to the internal disputes of the House of Bourbon . 
 = = = The mutiny of Álzaga = = = 
 The outbreak of the Peninsular War in Spain and the capture of the Spanish king Ferdinand VII generated a political crisis in the Spanish colonies in the Americas . The first project to maintain the monarchy was the short @-@ lived Carlotism , which sought to crown Carlota Joaquina as regent . This project was supported by criollos like Manuel Belgrano and Juan José Castelli , but whether Saavedra supported it is disputed . The Carlotism was abandoned soon afterwards , and the people sought other projects . 
 Francisco Javier de Elío established a government Junta in Montevideo , similar to the ones established in Spain , and his ally in Buenos Aires , Martín de Álzaga , sought to do a similar thing . The Mutiny of Álzaga took place on January 1 , 1809 . He accused Liniers of trying to appoint loyal members to the Cabildo , and gathered a small demonstration to request his resignation . The rebels , backed by some peninsular militias , occupied the Plaza . Liniers was about to resign , to prevent further conflicts . 
 Cornelio Saavedra , who was aware of the conspiracy , considered it a plot by peninsulars to secure political power over the criollo peoples . He marched with the Regiment of Patricians swiftly to the Plaza , and thwarted the mutiny . There was no violence in the operation , as the criollos forced the rebels to give up just by the sheer force of numbers . Thus , Liniers stayed in office as viceroy . All the heads of the mutiny were sentenced to prison at Carmen de Patagones , and the militias that took part in it were dissolved . The only peninsular militias remaining were those of <unk> and <unk> , who did not join the mutiny ; criollos obtained the military command , and the political power of Saavedra increased even more . 
 A few months later , the Junta of Seville appointed a new Viceroy , Baltasar Hidalgo de Cisneros . Some patriots proposed a self @-@ coup to keep Liniers in power and resist the new viceroy , but Saavedra and Liniers himself did not accept it and the transition was performed without problems . Although Saavedra supported the plans of the criollos to seize power , he warned about taking rushed measures , considering that the ideal time to do so would be when the Napoleonic forces achieved a decisive advantage in the Spanish conflict . Until then , he forced the other revolutionaries to stay quiet by denying the help of his regiment . His usual quote was " Peasants and gentlemen , it is not yet time -- let the figs ripen , and then we 'll eat them . " Although he was sometimes suspected of sympathy for Cisneros for his reluctance to take action against him , he maintained his strategy . Saavedra 's political moderation may have been influenced by his previous career in the Cabildo . 
 = = = The May Revolution = = = 
 The chance expected by Saavedra came in May 1810 , when two British ships came with news of the peninsular war . The previous January Seville was invaded , the Junta of Seville ceased working , and some members took refuge at Cadiz and Leon , the last undefeated Spanish provinces . The complete Spanish defeat seemed imminent . The viceroy tried to conceal the information by seizing all newspapers , but some of them were leaked into the possession of the revolutionaries . Colonel Viamonte called Saavedra and informed him of the news , requesting once again his military support . Saavedra agreed that it was a good context to proceed , and gave his famous answer : " Gentlemen : now I say it is not only time , but we must not waste a single hour . " 
 Cisneros called Saavedra and Martín Rodríguez , and requested their military support in the case of a popular rebellion . They refused to give such support , and Saavedra argued that Cisneros should resign because the Junta of Seville that had appointed him did not exist anymore . As a result , Cisneros gave in to the request of Juan José Castelli : to celebrate an open cabildo , an extraordinary meeting of the noteworthy peoples of the city , and discuss the situation . The next day an armed mob , led by Antonio Beruti and Domingo French , occupied the Plaza to demand the making of the open cabildo , doubting that Cisneros would actually allow it . Saavedra addressed the crowd and assured them that the Regiment of Patricians supported their claims . 
 The open cabildo was held on May 22 . The people discussed if Cisneros should stay in power and , in the case he was removed from office , which type of government should be established . Saavedra stayed silent for the most part , awaiting his turn to speak . The most important speakers were Bishop Benito Lue y Riega , Juan José Castelli , Ruiz Huidobro , Manuel Genaro <unk> , Juan José Paso and Juan Nepomuceno de Sola , among others . Saavedra was the last one to speak , and suggested that the political control should be delegated to the Cabildo until the formation of a governing Junta , in the manner and form that the Cabildo deemed appropriate . In his speech , he pointed out the phrase : " ( ... ) " And there be no doubt that it is the people that confers the authority or command . " This statement was in line with the <unk> of the sovereignty to the people , a political concept formulated by Castelli , stating that in the absence of the rightful governor the sovereignty returned to the peoples , who had then the power to give it to someone else . Castelli aligned his position with Saavedra 's , becoming the common position which was eventually passed with 87 votes . 
 However , the Cabildo appointed a Junta headed by Cisneros , who would stay in power , even if under a new office . Saavedra was appointed to this Junta , as well as Castelli and two peninsulars . They made the oath of office , but the Junta was received with strong popular unrest , as it was perceived as going contrary to the result of the open cabildo . By the night , Saavedra and Castelli resigned , convincing Cisneros to do the same . 
 The Cabildo rejected Cisneros ' resignation , and ordered the military to control the crowd and enforce the resolution of the previous day . The commanders pointed out that if they did so , their soldiers would mutiny . As the demonstration overran some sections of the cabildo , Cisneros ' resignation was finally accepted . The members of the new Junta were the result of a document with hundreds of signatures , drafted among the people in the plaza . Cornelio Saavedra was the president of this Junta . He rejected this at first , fearing that he may be suspected of promoting the revolution for personal interest , but finally accepted at Cisneros ' request . As the Junta was established on May 25 , the other cities were invited to send deputies to a constituent assembly to discuss the type of government ; on May 27 , they were invited to send deputies to join the Junta . Both invitations were contradictory , but the consequences would take place some months later . 
 The precise authorship of the aforementioned document is unclear , and so is the origin of the composition of the Junta . Saavedra said in his memoirs that it was " the people " , without being more precise . As he protested being appointed president , he could not be part of the negotiations ( Manuel Belgrano and Mariano Moreno , other members , are reported to have been appointed without their consent as well ) . It could not have been the Regiments of Patricians either : the Junta was not a military junta ( only two of nine members were military ) , and the Regiment would not have appointed Moreno , whose rivalry with Saavedra was known . A common accepted theory considers it to be a balance between Carlotists and Alzaguists . 
 The presidency of the Junta was the result of the high influence of the militias in general and Saavedra in particular in the local politics . From that time on , he spent most of his time at the fort of Buenos Aires , managing the government with Moreno , Belgrano and Castelli . It is likely that he left his business for this . 
 = = = The Primera Junta = = = 
 Cornelio Saavedra was aware that the Junta would be resisted by factions still loyal to the old authorities . It was resisted locally by the Cabildo and the Royal Audiencia ; the nearby plazas of Montevideo and Paraguay did not recognize it ; and Santiago de Liniers organized a counter @-@ revolution at Córdoba . During this early period , the Junta worked united against the royalist threats . Mariano Moreno , the secretary of war , drafted the decrees and regulations to deal with royalists . First , a decree ordered punishment for anyone attempting to generate disputes , and for those concealing conspiracies against the Junta or other people . The Royal Audiencia swore loyalty to the Regency Council , in defiance to the Junta , so they were summoned , along with former viceroy Cisneros , and exiled to Spain with the pretext that there was a threat to their lives . The Junta appointed new members for the Audiencia loyal to the revolution . Moreno organized as well the Paraguay campaign and the First Upper Peru campaign , to the plazas that resisted the Junta . The second one , headed by Francisco Ortiz de Ocampo , would move to Córdoba and attack the counter @-@ revolution ; before marching to Upper Peru . Ocampo 's initial orders were to capture the counter @-@ revolutionary leaders and send them to Buenos Aires , so that they could be judged . When the counter @-@ revolution became stronger Moreno called the Junta and proposed that the enemy leaders should be shot as soon as they were captured instead of brought to trial . The new orders were carried out by Juan José Castelli . Cornelio Saavedra supported all these measures . 
 However , as time passed , Saavedra and Moreno distanced from each other . There was some initial distrust in the Junta towards Saavedra , but it was just the result of his desire for honours and privileges rather than an actual power struggle . When the initial difficulties were solved , Saavedra promoted an indulgent policy , while Moreno insisted on taking radical measures . For instance , the Junta discovered on October 16 that some members of the Cabildo secretly swore loyalty to the Regency Council . Moreno proposed executing them as a deterrent , and Saavedra replied that the government should promote leniency , and rejected the use of the Regiment of Patricians to carry out such executions . Saavedra prevailed , and the plotting members of the Cabildo were exiled instead of executed . Overall , Moreno was supported by " The Star " regiment , the other members of the Junta , and the activists of the May Revolution ; Saavedra was supported by the merchants , the <unk> to the old regime that saw him as a lesser evil , and the Regiment of Patricians , which was the largest one . 
 To counter the power of Saavedra , Moreno sought to modify the military balance of power by reforming the promotion rules . Up until that point , the sons of officials were automatically granted the status of cadet and were promoted just by seniority ; Moreno arranged that promotions were earned by military merits instead . However , in the short run this measure worked against him , as it antagonised members of the military who got promoted precisely because of such rules . 
 Saavedra thought that the victory at the battle of Suipacha strengthened his perspective , as the Junta would have defeated its enemies . He considered that Moreno 's animosity was rooted in the aforementioned mutiny of Álzaga , as Moreno took part in it . The victory was celebrated at the barracks of the Patricians , where the officer Anastasio Duarte , who was drunk , made a toast to Saavedra , as if he was the king of the Americas . Moreno drafted the Honours Suppression decree when he knew about it , which suppressed the ceremonies and privileges of the president of the Junta inherited from the former office of viceroy . However , Saavedra signed it without complaint . The Regiment of Patricians resented Moreno because of this , but Saavedra considered that it was a <unk> response to a trivial issue . 
 The arrival of the deputies called months ago generated disputes about the role they should have . Mariano Moreno supported the May 25 invitation , and wrote at the Gazeta de Buenos Ayres newspaper that the deputies should create a constituent assembly . Most of them , however , were aligned with the more moderated style of Saavedra . Led by Gregorio Funes from Córdoba , they requested to join the Junta , as told in the second invitation . Saavedra and Funes thought that , with this change , Moreno would be left in a minority group , unable to advance his more radical measures . 
 The deputies and the Junta met on December 18 , to decide what to do . Funes , who was close to Saavedra , argued that Buenos Aires had no right to appoint national authorities by itself and expect obedience from the provinces . The nine deputies voted for their incorporation , as did Larrea , Azcuénaga , Matheu and Alberti , founding members of the Junta . Saavedra declared that the incorporation was not fully legal , but that he supported it for public convenience . Only Juan José Paso voted with Moreno against the incorporation of the deputies . Left in a minority within the Junta , Moreno resigned . He was appointed to a diplomatic mission in Europe , but died in high seas , in unclear circumstances . Some historians consider that Saavedra plotted to murder Moreno , others that it was a negligence of the captain , and others that it was because of Moreno 's frail health . 
 = = = The Junta Grande = = = 
 With the new members , the Junta was renamed as Junta Grande . Cornelio Saavedra , who continued being president , had a clear control of it , together with Gregorio Funes . Although Moreno was no longer part of the Junta , his former supporters still plotted against Saavedra , meeting at the " Café de Marcos " . They accused Funes and Saavedra of being <unk> . The regiment of Domingo French attempted to mutiny , but they were discovered and defeated . It is unknown if Moreno was involved in this attempted mutiny or not . 
 The dispute was finally settled by the Revolution of the shoreline dwellers . The mayors Tomás <unk> and Joaquín Campana , supporters of Saavedra , led the " shoreline dwellers " ( Spanish : <unk> , poor people living in the outskirts of Buenos Aires ) to the Plaza , along with the Regiment of Patricians , and demanded the resignation of the <unk> Hipólito Vieytes , Azcuénaga , Larrea and Rodríguez Peña , appointing the Saavedrists Juan <unk> , Atanasio Gutiérrez , Feliciano Chiclana and Campana as their replacements . It was requested as well that the government should not change its political style without voting it first . However , although the revolution was done in support of Saavedra , Saavedra denied having any involvement in it , and condemned it in his autobiography . 
 Saavedra began to lose political power from this point . The decree of Mariano Moreno that changed the military promotions , which was never <unk> , began to bear fruit , even if Moreno was not in the Junta anymore . The army became more professional , and less based on militias . Many of the new military authorities opposed Saavedra . The political crisis increased with the unfavourable military outcomes of the war : Belgrano was defeated at the Paraguay campaign , Castelli at the Upper Peru campaign , and the capture of Montevideo became increasingly difficult with the intervention of Portuguese troops supporting it . The many members of the Junta made the internal work difficult , as all measures were discussed by all members , hindering the swift reactions needed by the war . Saavedra left Buenos Aires at this point , and headed to the Upper Peru , to take command of the Army of the North . He thought that he could be of greater help as a military leader than facing the political struggles of Buenos Aires . 
 = = = Fall and persecution = = = 
 Saavedra was warned by fellow members of the Junta , military leaders and even the Cabildo that if he left Buenos Aires , the government would be prone to fall into a political crisis . He left anyway , convinced that he would be able to reorganize the Army of the North . The warnings were justified ; shortly after his departure , the Junta was turned into a legislative power , while the executive would be managed by the First Triumvirate . This arrangement lasted for a short time , then the Junta was abolished . The Regiment of Patricians made a mutiny against the triumvirate , but failed . 
 Saavedra received the news eight days after arriving in Salta . He was informed that he was deposed as president of the Junta , and that he should hand the command of the Army of the North to Juan Martín de Pueyrredón . Trying to avoid returning to Buenos Aires , he requested to be relocated at Tucumán or Mendoza . He was allowed to stay at the later city , rejoining his wife and children . The press of Buenos Aires was very harsh about him , so the Triumvirate asked the governor to capture Saavedra and send him to Luján , near Buenos Aires . The order , however , was never carried out because the triumvirate was deposed by the Revolution of October 8 , 1812 , and replaced by the Second Triumvirate . 
 The appointment of the supreme director Gervasio Antonio de Posadas fostered further hostilities towards Saavedra . Posadas was among the people banished in 1811 , and made him a trial of residence as a revenge . Saavedra , defended by Juan de la Rosa Alba , was accused of organizing the 1811 revolution , along with Campana . The sentence ruled that Saavedra should be exiled , but he avoided it by crossing the Andes with his son and seeking political asylum at Chile . Juan José Paso requested the extradition of Saavedra , but the Chilean supreme director Francisco de la Lastra denied it . Saavedra did not stay in Chile for long ; a huge royalist attack to Chile ( which would end in the Disaster of Rancagua and the royalist reconquest of Chile ) made him cross the Andes again and seek refuge at Mendoza , along with Chilean expatriates . José de San Martín , ruling Mendoza at the time , allowed him to settle in San Juan . 
 Saavedra settled in San Juan in 1814 . He had a new son , Pedro Cornelio , and maintained a simple life growing grapes . He awaited the final decision of Posadas , but the supreme director had a political crisis at the time . The Spanish king Ferdinand VII had returned to the throne and demanded the colonies to return to their former organization , the royalists at Upper Peru were still a threat , and José Gervasio Artigas opposed Buenos Aires as well , because of its high centralism . As a result , Carlos María de Alvear became the new supreme director , who would decide the final fate of Cornelio Saavedra . 
 = = = Last years = = = 
 Alvear ordered Saavedra to move immediately to Buenos Aires , to close the case . He arrived to the city in time , and Alvear was sympathetic to his situation . However , Alvear was forced to resign a few days later , before being able to rule the case . The Buenos Aires Cabildo , the interim government , restored Saavedra 's military rank and honours , but the rule was abolished by Ignacio Álvarez Thomas , the following supreme director . He moved then to the countryside , to live with his brother Luis . He kept requesting to the government the restoration of his rank . 
 Finally , the supreme director Juan Martín de Pueyrredón appointed a commission to discuss the case of Saavedra . By this time , the Congress of Tucumán had made the Argentine Declaration of Independence a couple of years before . The commission restored Saavedra with the military rank of brigadier , and ordered the payment of all the wages he did not receive during the time he was demoted . A second commission ratified the ruling . The payment was not enough to compensate Saavedra 's losses , but he considered it a token of his restored prestige . He was appointed then to help with the protection of the frontier with the natives at Luján . 
 Angered with the passivity of Buenos Aires during the Luso @-@ Brazilian invasion of the Banda Oriental , Francisco Ramírez from Entre Ríos and Estanislao López from Santa Fe joined forces against the city . Saavedra fled to Montevideo , fearing that Buenos Aires would be obliterated if defeated . Ramírez and López won the battle of Cepeda , but the city was not destroyed , so Saavedra returned . He retired in 1822 , and lived with his family in the countryside . He offered his services at the beginning of the War of Brazil , despite being 65 years old , but Balcarce declined the offer . He wrote his memoirs , Memoria <unk> , in 1828 . 
 He died on March 29 , 1829 . He was taken to the cemetery by his sons . There was no state funeral at the time , because Juan Lavalle made a coup against the governor Manuel Dorrego and executed him , starting a period of civil war . Lavalle was defeated by Juan Manuel de Rosas , who was appointed governor . Once he restored peace , Rosas made a state funeral for Saavedra , on January 13 , 1830 . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 As president of the first government body created after the May Revolution , Saavedra is considered the first ruler of Argentina . However , as the Spanish juntas were not a presidential system , Saavedra was not the first President of Argentina ; that office would be created a decade afterwards . The Casa Rosada , official residence of the President of Argentina , holds a bust of Saavedra at the Hall of busts . 
 The Regiment of Patricians is still an active unit of the Argentine Army , currently as an air assault infantry . It is also the custodian of the Buenos Aires Cabildo , the welcoming party for visiting foreign dignitaries to Argentina and the escort and honor guard battalion for the City Government of Buenos Aires . As of September 22 , 2010 , the Regiment 's headquarters building has been declared as a National Historical Monument by the Argentine government , on the occasion of the country 's bicentennial year . 
 The historiography of Cornelio Saavedra is closely related to that of Mariano Moreno . As Saavedra had a conflict with him in the Junta , the perspectives towards him complement those about Moreno . The first liberal historians praised Moreno as the leader of the Revolution and a great historical man ; Saavedra was treated either as a weak man overwhelmed by Moreno , or as a counter @-@ revolutionary . This perspective did not acknowledge that Saavedra , as head of the Regiment of Patricians , was the most popular and influential man of the city since before the Revolution , and that he was reported to be staunch , cunning and ruthless . 
 Subsequently , revisionist authors would formulate accusations against Moreno , depicting him as a British agent and a man of mere theoretical European ideas without a strong relation with the South American context . Saavedra is depicted instead as a popular caudillo , a predecessor of José de San Martín and Juan Manuel de Rosas . This perspective did not acknowledge that the wealthy citizens were aligned with Saavedra against Moreno , that Saavedra himself was wealthy and aristocratic , and that the 1811 revolution made no requests of a social nature , save for the removal of Morenist forces from the Junta .

 = Saint @-@ Gaudens double eagle = 
 The Saint @-@ Gaudens double eagle is a twenty @-@ dollar gold coin , or double eagle , produced by the United States Mint from 1907 to 1933 . The coin is named after its designer , the sculptor Augustus Saint @-@ Gaudens , who designed the obverse and reverse . It is considered by many to be the most beautiful of U.S. coins . 
 In 1904 , President Theodore Roosevelt sought to beautify American coinage , and proposed Saint @-@ Gaudens as an artist capable of the task . Although the sculptor had poor experiences with the Mint and its chief engraver , Charles E. Barber , Saint @-@ Gaudens accepted Roosevelt 's call . The work was subject to considerable delays , due to Saint @-@ Gaudens 's declining health and difficulties because of the high relief of his design . Saint @-@ Gaudens died in 1907 , after designing the eagle and double eagle , but before the designs were finalized for production . 
 After several versions of the design for the double eagle proved too difficult to strike , Barber modified Saint @-@ Gaudens 's design , lowering the relief so the coin could be struck with only one blow . When the coins were finally released , they proved controversial as they lacked the words " In God We Trust " , and Congress intervened to require the motto 's use . The coin was minted , primarily for use in international trade , until 1933 . The 1933 double eagle is among the most valuable of U.S. coins , with the sole example currently known to be in private hands selling in 2002 for $ 7 @,@ 590 @,@ 020 .

 The double eagle , or twenty @-@ dollar gold piece , was first issued in 1850 ; its congressional authorization was a response to the increasing amount of gold available as the result of the California Gold Rush . The resulting Liberty Head double eagle , designed by Mint Engraver James Longacre , was struck for the remainder of the 19th century , though the design was modified several times . The double eagle , due to its very high face value , equivalent to several hundred dollars today , did not widely circulate , but was the coin most often used for large international transactions , in which settlement was to be in gold . In the West , where gold or silver coins were preferred to paper money — use of which was illegal in California in the aftermath of the Gold Rush — the coins saw some circulation . 
 Sculptor Augustus Saint @-@ Gaudens 's first association with the Mint was in 1891 , when he served on a committee judging entries for the new silver coinage . The Mint had offered only a small prize to the winner , and all invited artists ( including St. Gaudens himself ) refused to submit entries . The competition was open to the public , and the judging committee ( which consisted of Saint @-@ Gaudens , Mint Engraver Charles E. Barber , and commercial engraver Henry Mitchell ) found no entry suitable . This came as no surprise to Saint @-@ Gaudens , who told Mint Director Edward O. Leech that there were only four men in the world capable of such work , of whom three were in France and Saint @-@ Gaudens was the fourth . Barber , who had been Chief Engraver since 1879 , felt that Saint @-@ Gaudens overstated the case , and there was only one man capable of such coinage work — Barber himself . Leech responded to the failed competition by directing Barber to prepare new designs for the dime , quarter dollar , and half dollar , resulting in the Barber coinage , an issue which attracted considerable public dissatisfaction . 
 In 1892 , Saint @-@ Gaudens was asked to design the official medal of the World Columbian Exposition in Chicago ; it would be presented to prizewinning exhibitors . The obverse of Saint @-@ Gaudens 's design , showing Columbus coming ashore , was noncontroversial ; his reverse , which featured a torch @-@ bearing naked youth carrying wreaths to crown the victors , was attacked by the censoring postal agent , Anthony Comstock , as obscene . The exposition directors hastily withdrew the reverse design and replaced it with one created by Barber which , according to numismatic historian Walter Breen , was " notable only for banality " . A furious Saint @-@ Gaudens swore to have nothing more to do with the Mint or its employees , and for the next decade refused all commissions which might involve him with that bureau .

 On December 27 , 1904 , President Theodore Roosevelt , a personal friend of Saint @-@ Gaudens , wrote to his Secretary of the Treasury , Leslie Mortier Shaw : " I think the state of our coinage is artistically of atrocious hideousness . Would it be possible , without asking permission of Congress , to employ a man like Saint @-@ Gaudens to give us a coinage which would have some beauty ? " Roosevelt had Mint Director George E. Roberts write to Saint @-@ Gaudens , who replied , " I am extremely interested in the matter of the new designs of the coinage ... it will I assure you give me great pleasure to assist in the procuring of good work . " Roosevelt caused the Mint to engage Saint @-@ Gaudens to redesign some of the coins which could be changed without the need for Congressional approval — the cent and the four gold coins . No U.S. coin had ever been designed by anyone other than a Mint employee . 
 In November 1905 , Roosevelt wrote to Saint @-@ Gaudens to enquire how the gold coinage was progressing . The President mentioned that he had been looking at gold coins of Ancient Greece , and that the most beautiful ones were in high relief . Roosevelt suggested that the new designs could be in high relief , with a high rim to protect them . Saint @-@ Gaudens replied agreeing with Roosevelt , and proposing a design for the double eagle 
 some kind of a ( possibly winged ) figure of Liberty , striding forward as if on a mountaintop , holding aloft on one arm a shield bearing the stars and stripes with the word Liberty marked across the field ; in the other hand perhaps a flaming torch , the drapery [ of Liberty 's dress ] would be flowing in the breeze . My idea is to make it a living thing , and typical of progress . 
 On January 2 , 1906 , Saint @-@ Gaudens wrote to Shaw , enquiring whether a high relief was practical on coins struck at the Mint . Shaw did not immediately reply , but instead met with Roosevelt , who wrote that there was no objection to have the coins , many of which would be stored in bank vaults and not circulated , " as artistic as the Greeks could desire " . Roosevelt secured Shaw 's support for the redesign , although as the President wrote to Saint @-@ Gaudens , " of course he thinks I am a crack @-@ brained lunatic on the subject " . Shaw wrote to the sculptor on January 13 , reproducing a copy of a letter from Roberts which warned , " the judgement of the authority of all countries is that modern coins must be of low relief " , but as the President disagreed with Roberts 's view , Saint @-@ Gaudens could go ahead with a high @-@ relief design . Numismatic historian Roger W. Burdette commented , " This is also one of those times when the compelling egos of artist and President might have paid greater attention to director Roberts ' comments . By continuing with the design in a relief that was not coinable , Saint @-@ Gaudens lost his best chance to explore the limits of artistry on circulation coinage . " 
 Saint @-@ Gaudens wrote to Roosevelt later in January , " Whatever I produce cannot be worse than the <unk> now displayed on our coins . " However , Saint @-@ Gaudens foresaw resistance from Barber , who " has been in that institution since the foundation of the government , and will be found standing in its ruins " . In May 1906 , the sculptor wrote to Roosevelt that he had sent an assistant to Washington to obtain the technical details of the redesign , but " if you succeed in getting the best of the polite Mr. Barber or the others in charge , you will have done a greater work than putting through the Panama Canal . Nevertheless , I will stick at it , even unto death . " 
 In May 1906 , Saint @-@ Gaudens wrote to Secretary Shaw , asking if there was any objection to having the date in Roman numerals . Shaw replied , " While we are making coins for the people of the United States , I think we should confine ourselves to the English language . I have reminded our architects that I will dismiss the first one who puts a V on a public building where a U is intended . " However , Roosevelt overruled Shaw , and the sculptor proceeded with the use of Roman numerals . 
 Saint @-@ Gaudens had intended a flying eagle design for the cent , but developed it for the twenty @-@ dollar piece after learning that by law , an eagle was not to appear on the cent . Saint @-@ Gaudens 's health worsened through 1906 , as the cancer which would kill him forced him to have his assistant , Henry Hering , deal with many of the details of the work . Saint @-@ Gaudens had the models for the coins made in Paris , rather than at the Mint , in order to bypass any obstruction by the Mint . It was not until December 1906 that Roosevelt was finally given coin @-@ sized models of Saint @-@ Gaudens 's work by Hering , and Roosevelt wrote to the ailing sculptor , " I have instructed the Director of the Mint that these dies are to be reproduced just as quickly as possible and just as they are . It is simply splendid . I suppose I shall be impeached for it by Congress , but I shall regard that as a very cheap payment ! " 
 The obverse of Saint @-@ Gaudens 's final design shows a female figure of Liberty , who also represents victory . Saint @-@ Gaudens based his design on the female figure he had designed in creating New York City 's monument to General William Tecumseh Sherman , but the sculptor 's ultimate inspiration was the Nike of Samothrace . The figure for the Sherman monument was modeled by Henrietta Anderson , one of the artist 's favorite subjects . On the coin , Liberty holds a torch in one hand , representing enlightenment ; an olive branch in the other , a symbol of peace . She strides across a rocky outcrop ; behind her are the United States Capitol and the rays of the sun . The figure is surrounded by 46 stars , one for each of the states in 1907 . The reverse is a side view of a flying eagle , seen slightly from below , with a rising sun and its rays behind it , complementing the obverse design . The edge bears the lettering " E Pluribus Unum " . Saint @-@ Gaudens felt he could not place a third line of text on the reverse without unbalancing the composition , and the obverse lacked room for the motto , so it was placed on the edge .

 Mint Engraver Barber had closely followed the progress of the proposed recoinage , and wrote to Acting Mint Director Robert Preston on November 26 , 1906 : 
 [ Saint @-@ Gaudens ] talks so much about experiments , it may be to him , but to us it is no experiment , as we are just as certain that the relief of his eagle will never coin , as we are certain that the Sun will rise each morning , and the only object in all this trouble and waste of money is to convince those who will be convinced in no other way ... I think our friend [ Saint @-@ Gaudens ] is playing a game ... but our willingness , nay more , our desire to let the work tell its own story has rather called his hand , and he is not prepared to show it , and therefore is sparing for wind , or time . 
 In response to Barber 's letter , Preston wrote to Saint @-@ Gaudens , " there are no presses anywhere , in mints or in use among silversmiths , which can bring up your proposed relief at a single stroke . " When the models were brought to the Mint , Barber examined and rejected them . It was only after considerable discussion that he agreed to experiment . At that time , the Mint was intensely busy generating designs for new coinage for Cuba and the Philippines , and Barber was reluctant to waste time on what he considered an experimental piece which would never be coined for circulation . Experimental dies were made from the plaster model . Approximately 24 pieces were struck as patterns ; even though the Mint used a medal press , set for maximum pressure , it still took up to nine strokes of the press to fully bring out the design . These patterns are today known as the " Ultra High Relief " or " Extra High Relief " pieces , and only about 20 are known — one sold in a 2005 auction for $ 2 @,@ 990 @,@ 000 . On May 8 , 1907 , the President wrote Saint @-@ Gaudens , " It has proved hitherto impossible to strike them by one blow , which is necessary under the conditions of making coins of the present day . " On May 11 , 1907 , Saint @-@ Gaudens replied , " I am grieved that the striking of the die did not bring better results . Evidently it is no trifling matter to make Greek art conform with modern numismatics . " 
 A second set of dies was produced with the relief reduced somewhat , but still proved too high relief for practical coining , requiring three strokes of the press to fully bring out the design . Saint @-@ Gaudens had produced the models for these dies under the misapprehension that the first pieces had been struck on a production press , rather than on the Mint 's only medal press , and therefore only slight adjustment need be made . When Saint @-@ Gaudens died on August 3 , 1907 , Hering was working on a third model . Uncertain where to find Hering , Roosevelt ordered the new Secretary of the Treasury , George Cortelyou , to have the Mint finalize the design and put the coin in circulation by September 1 . Barber was recalled from his vacation in Ocean Grove , New Jersey , to comply with the President 's order . Barber wrote Philadelphia Mint Superintendent John Landis on August 14 that what Roosevelt wanted was impossible ; he had no dies nor any clear idea of how Saint @-@ Gaudens had planned to reduce the relief . The Mint chief engraver alleged that he could take no action with respect to the double eagle . On September 28 , Hering finally appeared at the Mint with a new set of models , which Barber again quickly rejected . Barber wrote to Preston , " Upon examination it was found that the relief of the models was so great that it would be a waste of time to make reductions for coinage , as it would be quite impossible to coin when the dies are made . " Instead , Barber began work on his own low relief version of Saint @-@ Gaudens 's design . 
 In August 1907 , Roosevelt nominated San Francisco Mint Superintendent Frank Leach as Director of the Mint ; he took office on November 1 , 1907 . In his memoirs , Leach recalled his initial interview with Roosevelt on the question of the double eagles : 
 Before I had become familiar with my surroundings the President sent for me . In the interview that followed he told me what he wanted , and what the failures and his disappointments had been , and proceeded to advise me as to what I should do to accomplish the purpose determined upon in the way of the new coinage . In this talk he suggested some details of action of a drastic character for my guidance , which he was positive were necessary to be adopted before success could be had . All this was delivered in his usual vigorous way , emphasizing many points by hammering on the desk with his fist . 
 On November 18 , the impatient Roosevelt directed that the second set of dies be used to strike coins , directly ordering the Mint to " begin the new issue , even if it takes you all day to strike one piece ! " Over 12 @,@ 000 of these " High Relief " pieces were struck and were released into circulation in 1907 and 1908 . Barber wrote of the High Relief pieces to Landis , " Mr. Hart has put the mill into operation and I send you two pieces showing the result ; these are not selected as all the coins now made are the same as these two , which gives me alarm as they are so well made that I fear the President may demand the continuance of this particular coin . " Barber completed work on his version of the design , with a greatly lowered relief , and the new coin went into production on a large @-@ scale basis . A total of 361 @,@ 667 of the revised design were produced by the Mint in 1907 ; the " Low Relief " coins were released into circulation at the end of December 1907 . Barber 's modifications were denounced both by the sculptor 's family and by Hering . Among other alterations , Barber changed the Roman numeral <unk> for the date to the Arabic numeral " 1907 " . In spite of the modifications , according to R.S. Yeoman in his A Guide Book of United States Coins , many consider the Saint @-@ Gaudens double eagles the most beautiful of U.S. coins . 
 In his book discussing the redesigns of U.S. coins between 1905 and 1908 , Burdette casts blame on all parties for the delays in the new coin : 
 Responsibility for most of the delays in producing the new coinage must fall on the Saint @-@ Gaudens studio for failing to deliver models in a timely manner . The mint failed in its responsibility to clearly communicate to the President and artist its limitations and technical requirements for large @-@ scale coinage . President Roosevelt , likewise , must bear responsibility for constantly confusing the project with conflicting or incomplete communication to the artist and Mint Bureau . 
 Despite the difficulties with the design , Roosevelt was very pleased with the new double eagle . Mint Director Leach recalled that when " I laid upon his desk a sample of beautifully executed double eagles of the Saint @-@ Gaudens design , he was most enthusiastic in his expressions of pleasure and satisfaction . I certainly believed him when he declared he was ' delighted ' . He warmly congratulated me on my success , and was most complimentary in his comments . " In January 1908 , the President wrote to his friend , Dr. William Sturgis Bigelow : 
 I am very much pleased that you like that coin . I shall have all kinds of trouble over it , but I do feel what you say is true : that is , that it is the best coin that has been struck for two thousand years , and that no matter what is its temporary fate , it will serve as a model for future coin makers , and that eventually the difficulties in connection with making such coins will be surmounted . 
 = = Production = = 
 Roosevelt had specifically requested Saint @-@ Gaudens not to put " In God We Trust " on the new coin , feeling that the motto 's presence on coins was a debasement of God 's name , as the coins might be spent to further criminal activities . Saint @-@ Gaudens was quite willing to omit the motto , as he felt the words detracted from the design elements . There was a public outcry about the omission of the motto , and what Breen describes as an " outraged and furious " Congress ordered the motto to appear . Barber duly modified the coin to include the motto , taking the opportunity to make several minor changes to the design , which , according to Breen , do not improve the coin . In 1912 , two more stars were added to the obverse to reflect the admission of New Mexico and Arizona to the Union . The existing stars were not adjusted in position ; the two new ones were placed on the outcropping at the lower right . 
 The only major variety of the series occurred in 1909 , an overdate in which an 8 shows under the final nine in the date . This most likely happened when a 1908 die was struck by a 1909 @-@ dated hub , creating the overdate . Perhaps half of the 161 @,@ 282 double eagles struck at Philadelphia that year display the overdate . 
 In 1916 , minting of double eagles ceased , as bullion prices were rising because of World War I , which also caused an influx of American gold coins from Europe . Holders of gold coin , such as banks , refused to pay them out at par value , and they vanished from circulation . In the aftermath of the war , international demand for the coin was restored ; many Europeans distrusted their local currencies and desired double eagles to hold . The coin was struck in large numbers once coinage was resumed in 1920 , but it was now almost exclusively a coin of international trade , or was held by banks as backing for gold certificates . The coin itself rarely circulated in the United States . The onset of the Depression in 1929 did not halt the minting of double eagles , but the coins were for the most part held in Treasury vaults , and few were released . Many of the great rarities of the Saint @-@ Gaudens series stem from its final years . Despite a mintage of almost 1 @.@ 8 million pieces of the 1929 double eagle , it is estimated that fewer than 2 @,@ 000 exist today , with all the rest melted by the government in the late 1930s . 
 = = End of the series ; the 1933 double eagle = = 
 According to numismatic historian Roger Burdette , the first 1933 double eagles were struck on March 2 , 1933 . On March 15 , 1933 , 25 @,@ 000 new double eagles were delivered to Mint Cashier Harry Powell , and by longstanding Mint custom , were available for paying out . On March 6 , however , the newly inaugurated president , Franklin Roosevelt , had ordered the Treasury not to pay out any gold , and ordered that banks holding gold transmit it to their Federal Reserve bank . Numismatists and coin dealers were still allowed to possess and deal in gold coins ; all others required a special license . The double eagle continued to be struck until May . On December 28 , 1933 , Acting Secretary of the Treasury Henry Morgenthau ordered Americans to turn in all gold coins and gold certificates , with limited exceptions , receiving paper money in payment . Millions of gold coins were melted down by the Treasury in the following years . Two 1933 double eagles were sent by the Mint to the Smithsonian Institution for the National Coin Collection , where they remain today . 
 Prominent coin dealer and numismatic writer Q. David Bowers suggests that despite the ban on paying out gold , examples of the 1933 double eagle could have been obtained legally from Mint Cashier Powell in an exchange for earlier double eagles . Bowers also notes that Secretary of the Treasury William Woodin was a numismatist who in addition to collecting coins , had written books on the subject . Dealer William Nagy later recalled visiting Secretary Woodin and being shown five 1933 double eagles , with the secretary stating that he had several more . 
 By the early 1940s , between eight and 10 specimens were known ; two of them were sold by Texas dealer B. Max Mehl . In 1944 , a journalist enquired of the Mint regarding the 1933 double eagles . Mint officials could find no record of any issuance of the coins , and decided those in private hands must have been obtained illegally . Over the next few years , the Secret Service seized a number of specimens , which were subsequently melted . One piece , however , wound up in the hands of King Farouk of Egypt , who even obtained a U.S. export license for the coin . What became of the Farouk specimen after his death is unclear , but the coin resurfaced in the late 1990s . When brought to New York for sale to a prospective buyer , it was seized by U.S. authorities . After litigation , a compromise was reached to allow the coin to be auctioned , with the proceeds to be divided equally between the government and the private owners . In 2002 this coin sold at auction by Sotheby 's for $ 7 @,@ 590 @,@ 020 . The purchase price included $ 20 paid to the federal government to monetize a coin it contended had never been officially released . 
 In 2004 , 10 specimens of the 1933 double eagle were submitted to the Mint for authentication by the heirs of a Philadelphia jeweler who may have been involved in obtaining them from the Mint in 1933 . The Mint authenticated them , and refused to give them back . The heirs brought suit against the government in 2006 , and a federal judge ordered the government to file a forfeiture action regarding the coins . The government brought such a suit in 2009 ; it was tried in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania beginning on July 7 , 2011 . On July 21 , 2011 , a jury decided that the coins had been properly seized by the Federal government . Judge <unk> D. Davis confirmed that jury verdict on August 29 , 2012 . On April 17 , 2015 , a panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit ruled that the government had failed to file its forfeiture action in a timely manner , and that the heirs were entitled to the coins . That ruling was vacated by the full court on July 28 , 2015 , and the case set for further argument . 
 = = Reuse of the design = = 
 The obverse has appeared on American gold bullion coinage issued since 1986 . Saint @-@ Gaudens 's original design was reused , with two stars added next to the two which Barber had added in 1912 , recognizing the admission of Alaska and Hawaii to the Union . Saint @-@ Gaudens 's reverse was not used , yielding its place to sculptor Miley Busiek 's depiction of a family of eagles . 
 In 1907 , the Mint had experimented by striking about two dozen pieces of the same weight as the double eagle , bearing Saint @-@ Gaudens 's design , but which had a smaller , thicker planchet . These " checker " pieces were destroyed ( except two placed in the Mint 's coin collection ) when it was discovered that the consent of Congress was needed to change the diameter of any coin . In 2009 , the Mint struck a similar piece in .999 gold , using Saint @-@ Gaudens 's original ultra high relief design for both sides of the coin , though modified to a 50 @-@ star obverse . These pieces contain one ounce of gold , slightly more than the original double eagle .
