 = = = Royalist offensive = = = 
 Between December 1964 and February 1965 the royalists discerned four Egyptian attempts to drive directly into the Razih mountains . The intensity of these thrusts gradually diminished , and it was estimated that the Egyptians lost 1 @,@ 000 men killed , wounded and taken prisoner . Meanwhile , the royalists were building up an offensive . The Egyptian line of communications went from San 'a to <unk> , then <unk> , where it branched off north @-@ eastwards to Harf . From Harf it turned due south to Farah , and then South @-@ eastwards to Humaidat , <unk> and Hazm . From Hazm it led south @-@ eastwards to Marib and Harib . A military convoy went over this route twice a month . Since the royalists had closed the direct route across the mountains from San 'a to Marib , the Egyptians had no other way . 
 The royalists under the command of Prince Mohamed 's objective was to cut the Egyptians ' line and force them to withdraw . They intended to take over the garrisons along this line and establish positions from which they could interdict the Egyptian movement . They had prepared the attack with the help of the Nahm tribe , who tricked the Egyptians into believing that they were their allies and would take care of the mountain pass known as Wadi Humaidat themselves . The royalist deal was that the Nahm would be entitled to loot the ambushed Egyptians . The Egyptians may have suspected something was up , as they sent a reconnaissance aircraft over the area a day before the attack . The royalists thus occupied two mountains known as <unk> and Ahmar and installed 75 @-@ mm guns and mortars overlooking the wadi . On April 15 , the day after the last Egyptian convoy went through , the royalists launched a surprise attack . Both forces numbered at only a couple of thousands . The guns positioned on <unk> and Ahmar opened fire , and then the Nahm came out from behind the rocks . Finally , Prince Mohamed 's troops followed . This time , the royalists ' operation was fully coordinated by radio . Some of the Egyptians surrendered without resistance , others fled to <unk> 800 yards to the north . Both sides brought reinforcements and the battle shifted between Harf and Hazm . 
 Meanwhile , Prince Abdullah bin Hassan began to raid Egyptian positions north @-@ east of San 'a at <unk> , Prince Mohamed bin Mohsin was attacking the Egyptians with 500 men west of Humaidat , Prince Hassan struck out from near Sadah and Prince Hassan bin Hussein moved from <unk> , west of Sadah , to within mortar @-@ firing distance of the Egyptian airfield west of Sadah . Fifty Egyptians surrendered at <unk> , near Humaidat . They were eventually allowed to evacuate to San 'a with their arms . Mohamed 's policy was to keep officers as prisoners for exchange , and to allow soldiers to go in return for their arms . Three to five thousand Egyptian troops in garrisons on the eastern slopes of the mountains and in the desert now had to be supplied entirely by air .

 The royalist radio tried to widen the split in republican ranks by promising amnesty to all non @-@ royalists once the Egyptians were withdrawn . Al @-@ Badr also promised a new form of government : " a constitutionally democratic system " ruled by a " national assembly elected by the people of Yemen " . At Sallal 's request , Nasser provided him with ammunition and troop reinforcements by transport plane from Cairo . By August , the royalists had seven " armies " , each varying in strength between 3 @,@ 000 and 10 @,@ 000 men , with a total somewhere between 40 @,@ 000 and 60 @,@ 000 . There were also five or six times as many armed royal tribesmen , and the regular force under Prince Mohamed . In early June they moved into <unk> in eastern Yemen . On June 14 they entered <unk> and on July 16 they occupied Marib . According to official Egyptian army figures , they had 15 @,@ 194 killed . The war was costing Egypt $ 500 @,@ 000 a day . The royalists had lost an estimated 40 @,@ 000 dead . In late August , Nasser decided to get the Soviets more involved in the conflict . He convinced them to cancel a $ 500 million debt he had incurred and provide military aid to the republicans . In early May , Sallal fired his Premier , General Hassan Amri , and appointed Ahmed Noman in his place . Noman was considered a moderate who believed in compromise . He had resigned as president of the republican Consultative Council in December in protest against Sallal 's " failure to fulfill the people 's aspirations " . Noman 's first act was to name a new 15 @-@ man Cabinet , maintaining an even balance between Yemen 's two main tribal groupings , the mountain Zaidi Shias , who were mostly royalist , and the Shafi 'i Sunnis , who were mostly republican .

 Egypt had run up a foreign debt of nearly $ 3 billion , and the gap between exports and imports had widened to a record $ 500 million for 1965 . On Victory Day in Port Said , Nasser conceded that " We are facing difficulties . We must all work harder and make sacrifices . I have no magic button that I can push to produce the things you want " . Premier Zakaria Mohieddin raised Egypt 's income tax , added a " defense tax " on all sales , and boosted tariffs on nonessential imports . He also hiked the cost of luxury goods 25 % and set low price ceilings on most foodstuffs . He sent 400 <unk> to Cairo 's to arrest 150 shopkeepers for price violations . In March 1966 , the Egyptian forces , now numbering almost 60 @,@ 000 , launched their biggest offensive . The royalists counterattacked but the stalemate resumed . Egyptian @-@ supported groups executed sabotage bombings in Saudi Arabia . 
 In a speech on May Day , 1966 , Nasser said the war was entering a new phase . He launched what he called a " long @-@ breath strategy . " The plan was to pare the army from 70 @,@ 000 men to 40 @,@ 000 , withdraw from exposed positions in eastern and northern Yemen , and tighten the hold on particular parts of Yemen : the Red Sea coastline ; a northern boundary that takes in the well @-@ fortified town of Hajja and San 'a ; and the border with the South Arabian Federation , which was to become independent in 1968 . Nasser insisted that attacks on Najran , <unk> and other " bases of aggression " would continue , arguing that " these were originally Yemeni towns , which the Saudis usurped in 1930 " . 
 Assistant Secretary of State for the Near East and South Asia , flew in for talks with both Faisal and Nasser . In Alexandria , Nasser refused to pull out his troops , despite the risk of losing part or all of a new $ 150 million US food @-@ distribution program , and another $ 100 million worth of industrial @-@ development aid . Later that month , Alexei Kosygin counseled Nasser not to risk a stoppage of the U.S. Food for Peace program because Russia could not afford to pay the bill . The Russians were also willing to aid Nasser with arms and equipment in Yemen , but feared that a widening of the conflict to Saudi Arabia would lead to a " hot war " confrontation in the Middle East . Nasser was warned that " the Soviet Union would be displeased to see an attack on Saudi Arabia . " 
 In October , Sallal 's palace in San 'a was attacked with a bazooka , and insurgents began targeting an Egyptian army camp outside the city and setting fire to Egyptian installations , killing a reported 70 Egyptian troops . Sallal arrested about 140 suspects , including Mohamed Ruwainy , the ex @-@ Minister for Tribal Affairs , and Colonel Hadi Issa , former deputy chief of staff of the armed forces . Sallal accused Ruwainy and Issa of organizing a " subversive network seeking to plunge the country into terrorism and panic " and planning a campaign of assassination , financed by Saudi Arabia , Britain , Israel and the US . Ruwainy , Issa and five others were executed , while eight others received prison sentences ranging from five years to life . In February , 1967 , Nasser vowed to " stay in Yemen 20 years if necessary " , while Prince Hussein bin Ahmed said " We are prepared to fight for 50 years to keep Nasser out , just as we did the Ottoman Turks . " Tunisia broke diplomatic relations with the republic , saying that the Sallal government no longer has power to govern the country . Sallal 's chargé d 'affaires in Czechoslovakia flew to Beirut and announced that he was on his way to offer his services to the royalists . Nasser said that " As the situation now stands , Arab summits are finished forever . " 
 = = = = Chemical warfare = = = = 
 The first use of gas took place on June 8 , 1963 against <unk> , a village of about 100 inhabitants in northern Yemen , killing about seven people and damaging the eyes and lungs of twenty @-@ five others . This incident is considered to have been experimental , and the bombs were described as " home @-@ made , amateurish and relatively ineffective " . The Egyptian authorities suggested that the reported incidents were probably caused by napalm , not gas . The Israeli Foreign Minister , Golda Meir , suggested in an interview that Nasser would not hesitate to use gas against Israel as well . There were no reports of gas during 1964 , and only a few were reported in 1965 . The reports grew more frequent in late 1966 . On December 11 , 1966 , fifteen gas bombs killed two people and injured thirty @-@ five . On January 5 , 1967 , the biggest gas attack came against the village of <unk> , causing 270 casualties , including 140 fatalities . The target may have been Prince Hassan bin Yahya , who had installed his headquarters nearby . The Egyptian government denied using poison gas , claiming that Britain and the US were using the reports as psychological warfare against Egypt . On February 12 , 1967 , it said it would welcome a UN investigation . On March 1 , U Thant said he was " powerless " to deal with the matter . 
 On May 10 , the twin villages of <unk> and <unk> in Wadi <unk> , where Prince Mohamed bin Mohsin was in command , were gas bombed , killing at least seventy @-@ five . The Red Cross was alerted and on June 2 , it issued a statement in Geneva expressing concern . The Institute of Forensic Medicine at the University of Berne made a statement , based on a Red Cross report , that the gas was likely to have been <unk> derivatives - phosgene , mustard gas , lewisite , chlorine or cyanogen bromide . The gas attacks stopped for three weeks after the Six @-@ Day War of June , but resumed on July , against all parts of royalist Yemen . Casualty estimates vary , and an assumption , considered conservative , is that the mustard and phosgene @-@ filled aerial bombs caused approximately 1 @,@ 500 fatalities and 1 @,@ 500 injuries .

 By 1967 , Egyptian forces relied exclusively on defending a triangle linking Hodeida , Taiz and San 'a , while striking southern Saudi Arabia and North Yemen with air sorties . In August , 1967 , in order to make up for the 15 @,@ 000 Egyptian killed , captured or missing , as a result of the Six @-@ Day War , Nasser recalled 15 @,@ 000 of his troops from Yemen . Egypt imposed higher taxes on its middle and upper classes , raised workers ' compulsory monthly savings by 50 % , reduced overtime pay , cut the sugar ration by a third , and curtailed practically all major industrial programs . Only military expenditures were increased , by $ 140 million to an estimated $ 1 billion . Nasser also increased the price of beer , cigarettes , long @-@ distance bus and railroad fares and admission to movies . Egypt was losing $ 5 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 a week in revenues from the closing of the Suez Canal , on the other side of which , the Israelis were sitting on the Sinai wells that had produced half of Egypt 's oil supply . Egypt 's hard @-@ currency debt was now approaching $ 1 @.@ 5 billion and its foreign @-@ exchange reserves were down to $ 100 million . 
 As part of the Khartoum Resolution of August , Egypt announced that it was ready to end the war in Yemen . Egyptian Foreign Minister , Mahmoud Riad , proposed that Egypt and Saudi Arabia revive their Jeddah Agreement of 1965 . Faisal expressed satisfaction with Nasser 's offer , and al @-@ Badr promised to send his troops to fight with Egypt against Israel , should Nasser live up to the Jeddah agreement Nasser and Faisal signed a treaty under which Nasser would pull out his 20 @,@ 000 troops from Yemen , Faisal would stop sending arms to al @-@ Badr , and three neutral Arab states would send in observers . Sallal accused Nasser of betrayal . Nasser <unk> more than $ 100 million worth of Saudi assets in Egypt , and Faisal <unk> two Egyptian @-@ owned banks that he had taken over earlier that year . Saudi Arabia , Libya , and Kuwait agreed to provide Egypt with an annual subsidy of $ 266 million , out of which $ 154 million was to be paid by Saudi Arabia . 
 Sallal 's popularity among his troops declined , and after two bazooka attacks on his home by disaffected soldiers , he took Egyptian guards . He ordered the execution of his security chief , Colonel Abdel Kader <unk> , after <unk> 's police fired into a mob attacking an Egyptian command post in San 'a , and had refused to recognize the committee of Arab leaders appointed at Khartoum to arrange peace terms . He also fired his entire Cabinet and formed a new one , installing three army men in key ministries , and took over the army ministry and the foreign ministry for himself . Meanwhile , Nasser announced the release of three republican leaders who had been held prisoner in Egypt for more than a year , and who were in favor of peace with the royalists . The three were Qadi Abdul Rahman Iryani , Ahmed Noman and General Amri . When Sallal met with Nasser in Cairo in early November , Nasser advised him to resign and go into exile . Sallal refused and went to Baghdad , hoping to get support from other Arab Socialists . As soon as he left Cairo , Nasser sent a cable to San 'a , instructing his troops there not to block an attempt at a coup . 
 = = = Siege of Sana 'a = = = 
 On November 5 , Yemeni dissidents , supported by republican tribesmen called down to San 'a , moved four tanks into the city 's dusty squares , took over the Presidential Palace and announced over the government radio station that Sallal had been removed " from all positions of authority " . The coup went unopposed . In Baghdad , Sallal asked for political asylum , saying " every revolutionary must anticipate obstacles and difficult situations " . The Iraqi government offered him a home and a monthly grant of 500 dinars . 
 The new republican government was headed by Qadi Abdul Rahman Iryani , Ahmed Noman and Mohamed Ali Uthman . The Prime Minister was Mohsin al @-@ <unk> . Noman , however , remained in Beirut . He was doubtful of his colleagues reluctance to negotiate with the <unk> family , preferring to expel it instead . On November 23 , he resigned , and his place was taken by Hassan Amri . Prince Mohamed bin Hussein told the country 's chiefs " We have money , and you will have your share if you join us . If not , we will go on without you " . The chiefs agreed to mobilize their tribes . 6 @,@ 000 royalist regulars and 50 @,@ 000 armed tribesmen known as " the Fighting Rifles " surrounded San 'a , captured its main airport and severed the highway to the port of Hodeida , a main route for Russian supplies . In a battle twelve miles east of the capital , 3 @,@ 200 soldiers of both sides were killed , and an entire republican regiment reportedly deserted to the royalists . Bin Hussein gave them an ultimatum : " Surrender the city or be annihilated " . Iryani went to Cairo for what the Egyptian official press agency called " a medical checkup " . Foreign Minister Hassan Macky also left Yemen , leaving the government in charge of Amri . Amri declared a 6 p.m. curfew and ordered civilians to form militia units " to defend the republic " . In Liberation Square , six suspected royalist infiltrators were publicly executed by a firing squad , and their bodies were later strung up on poles . 
 The republicans boasted a new air force , while the royalists claimed to have shot down a MiG @-@ 17 fighter with a Russian pilot . The US State Department said that this claim , as well as reports of twenty @-@ four MiGs and forty Soviet technicians and pilots who had arrived in Yemen , were correct . In January , the republicans were defending San 'a with about 2 @,@ 000 regulars and tribesmen , plus armed townsmen and about ten tanks . They also had the backing of a score or more fighter aircraft piloted by Russians or Yemenis who passed a crash course in the Soviet Union . The city could still feed itself from the immediately surrounding countryside . Between 4 @,@ 000 and 5 @,@ 000 royalists suffered from republican air power , but had the advantage of high ground . However , they did not have enough ammunition , as the Saudis had halted arms deliveries after the Khartoum agreement and stopped financing the royalists after December . 
 = = = Final accords = = = 
 By February 1968 , the siege was lifted and the republicans had essentially won the war . Meanwhile , the British had withdrawn from the Federation of South Arabia , which had now become South Yemen . The royalists remained active until 1970 . Talks between the two sides commenced while the fighting went on . The Foreign Minister , Hassan Makki , said " Better years of talk than a day of fighting " . In 1970 , Saudi Arabia recognized the Republic , and a ceasefire was effected . The Saudis gave the republic a grant of $ 20 million , which was later repeated intermittently , and Yemeni sheikhs received Saudi stipends . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 By 1971 , both Egypt and Saudi Arabia had disengaged from Yemen . South Yemen formed a connection with the Soviet Union . In September 1971 , Amri resigned after murdering a photographer in San 'a , and more power was given to Iryani , the effective President . By then , the royalists were integrated into the new republic , except for al @-@ Badr 's family , and a consultative Council was established . Clashes along the border between the states rose , and in 1972 a small war broke . 
 After the war , the tribes were better represented in the republican government . In 1969 , sheikhs were brought into the National Assembly and in 1971 into the Consultative Council . Under Iryani , the sheikhs , particularly the ones who fought for the republicans and were close to the mediation attempt . By the end of the war there was a breach between the older and more liberal politicians and republican sheiks , and certain army sheiks and activists from South Yemen . In the summer of 1972 , a border war broke and ended with a declaration from both North Yemen and South Yemen that they would reunite , but they did not . There were complaints in North Yemen about foreign influence by Saudi Arabia .

 Muhammad al @-@ Badr led his campaign with the princes of the house of <unk> . Those included Hassan bin Yahya , who had come from New York , Mohamed bin Hussein , Mohamed bin Ismail , Ibrahim al <unk> , and Abdul Rahman bin Yahya . At fifty @-@ six , Hassan bin Yahya was the oldest and most distinguished . Prince Hassan was made Prime Minister and Commander @-@ in @-@ Chief . The Imam was joined by his childhood pen pal , American Bruce Conde , who set up the post office and would later rise to the rank of general in the Royalist forces . 
 In 1963 , the Saudis spent $ 15 million to equip royalist tribes , hire hundreds of European mercenaries , and establish their own radio station . Pakistan , which saw a chance to make money in the conflict , extended rifles to the royalists . Remnants of the Imam 's Army also had elements of the Saudi National Guard fight alongside its ranks . Iran subsidized royalist forces on and off , as the Shah felt compelled to provide al @-@ Badr ( a Zaidi ) with financing . The British allowed convoys of arms to flow through one of its allies in Northern Yemen , the Sheriff of <unk> , who was protected by the British administration in Aden . British military planes conducted night operations to resupply al @-@ Badr 's forces . The MI6 was responsible for contacting the royalists , and used the services of a private company belonging to Colonel David Stirling , founder of the Special Air Service ( SAS ) , who recruited dozens of former SAS men as advisors to the royalists . Britain participated in a $ 400 million British air defense program for Saudi Arabia . The Lyndon Johnson administration was more willing than Kennedy 's to support long @-@ range plans in support of the Saudi army . In 1965 , the US authorized an agreement with the Corps of Engineers to supervise the construction of military facilities and in 1966 it sponsored a $ 100 million program which provided the Saudi forces with combat vehicles , mostly trucks . Faisal also initiated an Islamic alignment called the Islamic Conference , to counter Nasser 's Arab socialism . 
 The tribes of Southern Saudi Arabia and Northern Yemen were closely linked , and the Saudis enticed thousands of Yemeni workers in Saudi Arabia to assist the royalist cause . In addition to the Saudis and British , the Iraqis also sent plane loads of Baathist Yemenis to undermine Sallal 's regime . The royalists fought for the Imam despite his father 's unpopularity . One sheik said " The Imams have ruled us for a thousand years . Some were good and some bad . We killed the bad ones sooner or later , and we prospered under the good ones " . The hill tribes were Shia , like the Imam , while the Yemenis of the coast and the south were Sunni , as were most Egyptians . President Sallal was himself a mountain Shia fighting with lowland Sunnis . Al @-@ Badr himself was convinced that he was Nasser 's biggest target , saying " Now I 'm getting my reward for befriending Nasser . We were brothers , but when I refused to become his stooge , he used Sallal against me . I will never stop fighting . I will never go into exile . Win or lose , my grave will be here " . 
 Al @-@ Badr had formed two royalist armies — one under his uncle Prince Hassan in the east and one under his own control in the west . Both armies controlled most of the north and east of Yemen , including the towns of Harib and Marib . The provincial capital of Northern Yemen , Sadah , which would have given the Imam a key strategic road towards the main capital San 'a , was controlled by the republicans . There were also areas like the town of Hajjah , where the royalists controlled the mountains while the Egyptians and republicans controlled the town and fortress . Mercenaries from France , Belgium and England , who had fought in Rhodesia , Malaya , Indochina and Algeria , were sent to assist the Imam in planning , training and giving the irregular forces the ability to communicate with one another and the Saudis . They trained tribesmen in the use of antitank weapons , such as the 106mm gun and in mining techniques . The numbers of mercenaries are estimated in the hundreds , although Egyptian sources at the time reported 15 @,@ 000 . Royalist tactics were confined to guerilla warfare , isolating conventional Egyptian and republican forces , and conducting attacks on supply lines . 
 = = = = British involvement 1962 – 1965 = = = = 
 Between 1962 and 1965 Britain engaged in covert operations in support of Royalist forces fighting the Egyptian backed Republican regime that had seized power in the Yemeni capital Sana 'a in September 1962 . Until the end of 1965 , the British presence in Aden was considered of high interest to the United Kingdom , linked to the realization of oil assets in the Middle East . The means to secure this presence however involved a bitter argument within the British government , with no coherency in decision making on the Yemen issue . The objective of the British was mainly keeping the Aden base via cooperating with the Federation of South Arabia , which complicated British relations with many global and regional players , as well as with the rulers of South Arabia themselves . The British involvement was executed mainly via the British Mercenary Organization ( BMO ) , which was capable to stage its own covert operations , independent of London and away from the view of their sponsor Saudi Arabia . The BMO was specifically formed to train and support the royalists on the course of the war . 
 According to Duff Hart @-@ Davis , the British mercenary leader Jim Johnson had originally considered buying their own aircraft , a Lockheed Constellation 749 . He then flew to Teheran to try to persuade the Iranians to do an air drop . Hurt Davis further claims that success was finally achieved by an adviser to the mercenaries , the MP Neil " Billy " McLean , who privately ( without the British government 's knowledge ) flew to Tel Aviv to meet Moshe Dayan , defense minister , and Meir Amit , head of Mossad . According to " Haaretz " newspaper , Tony Boyle contacted David <unk> , the head of the Middle East department in the <unk> ( Cosmos ) section of the Mossad , and met with IAF commander Ezer Weizman and his officers . It was decided that the airdrops would be made . Haaretz suggested the crew of the airdrops were British ; while according to Hart @-@ Davis the crew were Israeli ( including the pilot named Arieh Oz ) , with Tony Boyle on board as an observer . Three decades after the war , former Mossad director , Shabtai <unk> , and Ariel Sharon both said Israel had been clandestinely involved in Yemen , though both remained vague concerning the nature and scale of the involvement . The airlifts were originally codenamed " Operation Gravy " , but were later renamed " Operation Porcupine " . The IAF 's largest transport plane , a Stratofreighter , was recruited for the British operation . According to Jones , what is clear however is that some of the mercenary air drops to the royalists ( code @-@ named " Mango " ) were organized by the British using an aircraft , which were contracted privately from IAF to the British mercenary operation and were either using Israeli air bases or Israeli transport planes themselves making the drops . 
 The first flight took off in March 1964 from Tel Nof Airbase . The first weapons drop , witnessed on the ground by British mercenary Lieutenant Colonel Johnny Cooper , provided the royalists with a morale @-@ boosting 180 old rifles , 34 @,@ 000 rounds of Mauser and 17 @,@ 000 rounds of .303 rifle ammunition , 72 six @-@ pounder antitank shells and 150 pounds of plastic explosive . According to Hart @-@ Davis , the Israelis had systematically concealed the source of the weapons delivered by the mercenaries , brazing out all the serial numbers , using Italian parachutes , and even ensuring that the packaging consisted of wood @-@ shavings from Cyprus . The contracted aircraft flew along the Saudi coastline . The Saudis did not have radar systems , and would later state they were not aware of the airlifts . The planes would make the drops and then refuel in French Somaliland ( now Djibouti ) and return to bases in Israel . During the sixth flight , Boyle suggested that the IAF aircraft would also be used to bomb San 'a . Weizman supported the idea and plans were made , but the Israel Defense Forces Chief of Staff ( <unk> ) Yitzhak Rabin and Israeli Prime Minister , Levi Eshkol , denied him . The Porcupine operation went on over a period of slightly more than two years , during which the Stratofreighter carried out 14 nighttime sorties from Tel Nof to Yemen . 
 British support to the royalists remained covert throughout . The Prime Minister Alec Douglas @-@ Home replied to Michael Foot 's parliamentary question on 14 May 1964 , having according to Hart @-@ Davis " to skate across thin ice " by saying " Our policy towards the Yemen is one of non @-@ intervention in the affairs of that country . It is not therefore our policy to supply arms to the Royalists in the Yemen , and the Yemen Government have not requested these or other forms of aid . " To a further question ( by George Wigg ) , Douglas @-@ Home said that " at no time in the last eighteen months have British arms been supplied to the Imam 's Government " . Hart @-@ Davis notes that this " may have been strictly true ; but ... a great many weapons of non @-@ British provenance had been spirited into the Yemen through Jim Johnson 's machinations . " 
 British mercenary involvement became public knowledge , when five letters addressed to Johnny Cooper were captured by the Egyptians in November 1963 . Their content was published by Al @-@ Ahram and then broadcast by Cairo radio on 1 May 1964 . Al @-@ Ahram quoted an estimate for British , French and other foreigners of " over 300 officers " , " directed from Britain and most probably under the command of British Intelligence " . On 5 July 1964 the Sunday Times published the letters , connecting " these <unk> freebooters " ( Cooper and his team ) with Tony Boyle . 
 However , the British Government was able to continue denying any knowledge of mercenary activity . On 21 July 1964 , Douglas @-@ Home replied to a parliamentary question by saying " Both the present High Commissioner and his predecessor have assured us that they were not aware that the person in question ( Tony Boyle ) was involved in any way " . The following day ( 22 July 1964 ) , Douglas @-@ Home sent a memorandum to the Foreign Secretary Rab Butler , in which he " decreed that the United Kingdom should ' make life intolerable ' for Nasser , ' with money and arms ' , and that this ' should be deniable if possible ' . " The result was that a secret Joint Action Committee was created to handle British policy on Yemen . The British support continued until 1965 , when the Kingdom decided to abandon its Aden Colony . 
 = = = = Saudi and Jordanian support = = = = 
 Saudis and Jordanians provided an active support to the royalists through the first years of war . The September 1962 coup d 'état in Yemen was perceived a threat to the monarchies in both Saudi Arabia and Jordan , prompting shipments of weapons to the royalists , beginning October 1 . The support to the monarchists was quickly countered by the Egyptian aid to the Republicans , rapidly spiraling the country into a full @-@ scale war , as the Republicans called for general mobilization and the Egyptians dispatching troops . On November 4 , with the war expanding across North Yemen , the Mecca Radio reported of Egyptian air force attacks on Saudi villages . The same day , a military alliance of Saudi Arabia and Jordan became widely known . Following the Egyptian raids on Saudi Arabia and the official Joint Defense Pact formed between Egypt and the Republicans , the Saudis decided to launch attacks on the Republicans in North Yemen . 
 The Jordanians withdrew from the war in 1963 , by recognizing the Republicans , but the Saudi support continued . At some point Saudi border towns and airfields were attacked by Egyptian forces in order to " prevent Saudi supplies and ammunition from reaching Royalist @-@ held areas in the Yemen " . 
 = = = Egyptian deployment = = = 
 Anwar Sadat was convinced that a regiment reinforced with aircraft could firmly secure Al @-@ Sallal and his free officer movement , but within three months of sending troops to Yemen , Nasser realized that this would require a larger commitment than anticipated . A little less than 5 @,@ 000 troops were sent in October 1962 . Two months later , Egypt had 15 @,@ 000 regular troops deployed . By late 1963 , the number was increased to 36 @,@ 000 ; and in late 1964 , the number rose to 50 @,@ 000 Egyptian troops in Yemen . In late 1965 , the Egyptian troop commitment in Yemen was at 55 @,@ 000 troops , which were broken into 13 infantry regiments of one artillery division , one tank division and several Special Forces as well as paratroop regiments . Ahmed Abu @-@ Zeid , who served as Egypt 's ambassador to royalist Yemen from 1957 to 1961 , sent numerous reports on Yemen that did not reach Ministry of Defense officials . He warned Egyptian officials in Cairo , including Defense Minister Amer , that the tribes were difficult and had no sense of loyalty or nationhood . He opposed sending Egyptian combat forces and , arguing that only money and equipment be sent to the Yemeni Free Officers , and warned that the Saudis would finance the royalists . 
 Egyptian field commanders complained of a total lack of topographical maps causing a real problem in the first months of the war . Commanders had difficulty planning military operations effectively or sending back routine and casualty reports without accurate coordinates . Field units were given maps that were only of use for aerial navigation . Chief of Egyptian Intelligence , Salah Nasr , admitted that information on Yemen was nonexistent . Egypt had not had an embassy in Yemen since 1961 ; therefore when Cairo requested information from the US ambassador to Yemen , all he provided was an economic report on the country . 
 In 1963 and 1964 the Egyptians had five squadrons of aircraft in Yemen at airfields near San 'a and Hodeida . They were using Yak @-@ 11 piston @-@ engined fighters , MiG @-@ 15 and MiG @-@ 17 jet fighters , Ilyushin Il @-@ 28 twin @-@ engined bombers , Ilyushin Il @-@ 14 twin @-@ engined transports and Mil Mi @-@ 4 transport helicopters . They were also flying four @-@ engined Tupolev bombers from bases in Egypt , such as Aswan . All the air crew were Egyptian , except for the Tupolev bombers which were thought to have mixed Egyptian and Russian personnel . The Ilyushin transports flying between Egypt and Hodeida had Russian crews . Throughout the war , the Egyptians relied on airlift . In January 1964 , when royalist forces placed San 'a under siege , Egyptian Antonov heavy @-@ lift cargo planes airlifted tons of food and kerosene into the region . The Egyptians estimate that hundreds of millions of dollars were spent to equip Egyptian and republican Yemeni forces , and in addition , Moscow refurbished the Al @-@ Rawda Airfield outside San 'a . The politburo saw a chance to gain a toehold on the Arabian Peninsula and accepted hundreds of Egyptian officers to be trained as pilots for service in the Yemen War . 
 Egyptian air and naval forces began bombing and shelling raids in the Saudi southwestern city of Najran and the coastal town of <unk> , which were staging points for royalist forces . In response , the Saudis purchased a British Thunderbird air defense system and developed their airfield in Khamis <unk> . Riyadh also attempted to convince Washington to respond on its behalf . President Kennedy sent only a wing of jet fighters and bombers to Dhahran Airbase , demonstrating to Nasser the seriousness of American commitment to defending U.S. interests in Saudi Arabia .

 Noman spoke over Radio San 'a , offering reconciliation and inviting " all tribes of all persuasions " to meet with him the following week at Khamir , 50 miles north of San 'a , to achieve " the one thing which we all prize over anything else : peace for the nation . " In order to convince al @-@ Badr to come the conference , Noman announced that he personally would head the republican delegation at Khamir , and that Sallal would stay in San 'a . Al @-@ Badr and his ranking chiefs did not attend the conference , but a handful of pro @-@ royalist sheiks were present . The conference named a committee of five tribal and four religious leaders who were charged with seeking out the " beguiled brothers " , al @-@ Badr and his friends . Noman 's effort , including a private promise to reach a withdrawal of Egyptian troops , was backed by Nasser . Radio Cairo hailed the Khamir conference as the " dawn of a new era . " Sallal called the talks " a complete success " , while al @-@ Badr stated that " It is essential that the conflict which has devastated our beloved country be brought to an end by peaceful negotiations between the Yemeni people themselves . " However , by early June , when Noman said that Egypt 's 50 @,@ 000 troops would have to be replaced by a joint royalist @-@ republican peace force , the Nasserites lost interest in the deal . After Noman flew to Cairo to protest directly to Nasser , Sallal threw seven civilian Cabinet ministers into jail . Noman resigned , saying " It is obvious that Sallal and his cronies are more interested in war than peace " . Sallal soon named a new Cabinet to replace Noman 's , with 13 military men and two civilians .

 By August , the war was costing Nasser $ 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 a day , when he arrived in <unk> harbor aboard his presidential yacht <unk> ( Freedom ) to negotiate with Faisal . It was Nasser 's first visit to Saudi Arabia since 1956 . At the request of the Egyptians , due to assassination rumors , the banners and flags normally put up to celebrate a visiting dignitary were omitted , the sidewalks were cleared of people , and the car was a special bulletproof model . On the evening of his arrival , Nasser was welcomed at a banquet and reception for 700 guests . In less than 48 hours they reached full agreement . Once the agreement was signed , Faisal embraced Nasser and kissed him on both cheeks . The agreement provided for 
 The gradual withdrawal of the Egyptian force within a ten @-@ month period and the cessation of all Saudi help to the royalists ; and 
 The formation of a Yemen Congress of fifty , representing all factions , which would be charged with forming a transitional regime and establishing procedures for a national plebiscite to determine Yemen 's future government .

 On November 23 , the two sides met in Haradh . The first issue was the name of the transition state that was supposed to exist until a plebiscite could be held the following year . The royalists wanted the name " Kingdom of Yemen " but were willing to settle for a neutral title like " State of Yemen " . The republicans insisted on having the word " republic " or " republican " in the title . It was agreed to suspend the conference until after the month @-@ long fast of Ramadan , which was about to begin the following week . The conference reached a deadlock when the Egyptians , possibly due to a tactical decision made by Amer , encouraged the republicans to take a headstrong stand . 
 = Thirty @-@ Eight Snub = 
 " Thirty @-@ Eight Snub " is the second episode of the fourth season of the American television drama series Breaking Bad , and the 35th overall episode of the series . It originally aired on AMC in the United States on July 24 , 2011 . In the episode , Walter plots to kill Gus for fear of repercussions from him , while Jesse holds wild parties to try to forget his despair . Meanwhile , Skyler tries to purchase a car wash business , while Marie struggles to deal with Hank 's growing depression problems . 
 Written by George Mastras and directed by Michelle MacLaren , " Thirty @-@ Eight Snub " featured guest appearances by Emily Rios as Andrea , Jim Beaver as black market gun vendor Lawson , and the first appearance by Ray Campbell in the recurring role of Gus ' henchman Tyrus Kitt . Due to filming commitments with the television series Supernatural , Beaver had only a half @-@ day to film his scene , which was set on a constructed set resembling a motel room . " Thirty @-@ Eight Snub " included several unusual camera angles , including a shot from the point of view of a Roomba robotic vacuum cleaner , and an extremely high crane shot of Walter from 180 @-@ feet in the air . 
 Jesse 's party scenes , which symbolized the character 's internal guilt and fragile state of mind , included background songs by rapper Flavor Flav and the band Honey Claws . " Thirty @-@ Eight Snub " received positive reviews , with some reviewers comparing it to the work of filmmakers Sergio Leone and Quentin Tarantino . It was seen by an estimated 1 @.@ 97 million household viewers , according to Nielsen Media Research , making it the second most @-@ watched episode of Breaking Bad by the fourth season , although it marked a significant decline in viewership compared to the previous episode , season premiere " Box Cutter " . 
 = = Plot = = 
 During a pre @-@ credits sequence , Walter ( Bryan Cranston ) purchases a Ruger LCR .38 snubnosed revolver from a black market gun dealer ( Jim Beaver ) . Secretly , Walter plans to use the <unk> gun to kill his employer , drug kingpin Gus ( Giancarlo Esposito ) . Since falling out of favor with Gus , Walter believes Gus will kill him if he does not act first ; when the gun dealer asks why Walter needs the gun , he insists it is strictly for self @-@ defense . Later , Walter practices drawing the weapon . Elsewhere , Gus ' henchman Mike ( Jonathan Banks ) drinks coffee at a bar and discovers dried blood on his jacket sleeve belonging to Victor ( Jeremiah Bitsui ) , a former colleague whom Gus previously murdered . Although Mike is silent , he appears to harbor conflicted feelings about what happened to Victor . Meanwhile , Jesse ( Aaron Paul ) has purchased expensive gadgets , like a sophisticated sound system and the Roomba robotic vacuum cleaner , but remains miserable after having murdered Gale ( David Costabile ) to save Walter and himself . After his friends Badger ( Matt L. Jones ) and Skinny Pete ( Charles Baker ) visit , Jesse has them arrange a wild party with dozens of people dancing , drinking and doing drugs to further distract himself . 
 Later , while cooking meth at their lab , Walter waits for Gus to arrive so he can kill him . Instead , Victor 's replacement Tyrus ( Ray Campbell ) arrives with Mike , who informs Walter he will never see Gus again . That night , Walter drives to Gus ' house and approaches with the gun , but before he can cross the street , Walter receives a call from Tyrus , who says simply , " Go home , Walter . " The next day , as Walter approaches Mike at the bar , Mike tells Walter that he observed Walter tailing him to the bar . Mike then reveals he could tell that Walter was carrying a weapon in the lab . Walter suggests he and Mike are in the same danger , and Gus could easily kill Mike the same way he killed Victor . This visibly unnerves Mike , who appears to be aware of this . Walter asks that Mike get him in a room with Gus so he can kill him . In response , Mike punches Walter , knocking him to the floor , kicks him in the torso a few times and then leaves the bar . 
 Skyler ( Anna Gunn ) calls Walter to inquire about buying the car wash where Walter once worked , which they plan to use as a front business for Walter 's drug money . When Walter fails to act on the purchase , Skyler starts doing her own detailed research about the business 's expenses and revenues . She later approaches the car wash owner , Bogdan ( Marius Stan ) , about the proposed purchase , but he angrily rejects her , making sexist remarks and condemning Walter for having insulted Bogdan when he quit the car wash . Meanwhile , Marie ( Betsy Brandt ) continues struggling to deal with her husband Hank 's ( Dean Norris ) deepening depression as he copes with physical therapy from having been shot . The bed @-@ ridden and bitter Hank constantly ignores or insults Marie and , even after celebrating a successful session with his physical therapist , he refuses to share any of that excitement with Marie . Meanwhile , after three straight days of partying , Jesse tries to keep hanging out with Badger and Skinny Pete , but they are exhausted and go home , along with all of the other guests in Jesse 's house . Alone with his thoughts , a depressed Jesse breaks down and cries , sitting less than an inch away from his speakers at an extremely high volume .

 " Thirty @-@ Eight Snub " was written by George Mastras and directed by Michelle MacLaren . Filmed in February 2011 , the episode was edited by Kelley Dixon , one of a handful of editors who have regularly worked on the series . The direction in " Thirty @-@ Eight Snub " included several camera angles from unusual viewpoints , including the perspective of Jesse 's Roomba , boxes of pizza , a baby 's vision and inside a car wash . The filming in Albuquerque , New Mexico was delayed by snow storms and record @-@ low temperatures which resulted in a state of emergency being declared . The episode featured guest performances by Emily Rios as Jesse 's ex @-@ girlfriend Andrea and Marius Stan as Bogdan , the car wash owner who constantly mistreated Walter when he worked for Bogdan in the pilot episode of Breaking Bad . Stan is not a professional actor but rather a physicist , and he was teaching at the University of Chicago when " Thirty @-@ Eight Snub " was filmed . " Thirty @-@ Eight Snub " also featured the first appearance by Ray Campbell as Tyrus Kitt , an employee of Gus who has replaced Victor , who was killed in the episode " Box Cutter " . The original script referred to the character simply as " New Victor " until Mastras came up with the name Tyrus . 
 Jim Beaver made an appearance on " Thirty @-@ Eight Snub " as Lawson , the gun vendor from the opening scene . Beaver previously starred in the HBO western drama series Deadwood along with Breaking Bad star Anna Gunn . He also previously appeared in " Field Trip " , a sixth season episode of The X @-@ Files which was written by Breaking Bad creator Vince Gilligan . While Gilligan believed Beaver to be a talented actor , he had never met him during the filming of either show . The CW Network television series Supernatural , in which Beaver co @-@ stars , was filming at the same time as " Thirty @-@ Eight Snub " , so Beaver flew in to Albuquerque for the Breaking Bad shoot and had only half a day to film the scenes . Mastras said he particularly enjoyed that the character tries to convince Walter to buy a gun legally because , " I like the aspect that you 've got this black market dealer who in an ironic way is the sound of morality here . " 
 Giancarlo Esposito is credited but does not appear , although his character 's voice is heard . 
 The motel room that Cranston and Beaver appear in was a set constructed by Breaking Bad production designer Mark Freeborn and construction coordinator William Gilpin . Director Michelle MacLaren wanted a genuine " rundown motel feel " , but believed it would be too difficult to film in an actual motel room because it would be too small for the cast and crew to fit inside . Instead , the set was designed so that several of the walls could be removed to make space for the cameras and crew . This allowed greater flexibility in shooting and camera angles , and the walls could be placed back into position if they were needed for the background of a shot . The first shot of the episode includes Walter speaking directly into the camera , and it quickly revealed he is speaking into a mirror in the motel room . MacLaren filmed the shot so it would be deliberately disorienting and unclear to the viewer where Walter was until the camera movement revealed the motel room . New York magazine writer Logan Hill interpreted Walter 's speaking into the mirror as a symbol for self @-@ reflection : " He stares at a mirror reflection of himself , studying his own image , wondering if the Walt other people see gives any hint of what he ’ s carrying inside . " 
 The scene when Walter approaches Gus ' house with plans to kill him ends with an extremely high crane shot of Walter standing alone in the middle of the street . MacLaren wanted that shot to be extremely effective because she believed it conveyed Walter 's helplessness , insignificance and lack of experience . Although the normal crane used for such overhead shots in Breaking Bad was only 30 feet tall , MacLaren rented a 180 @-@ foot @-@ tall crane specifically for that shot . Since the crew had only about four hours to shoot before losing the night @-@ time hours , the crane shot was the first one they filmed . It was shot by camera operators Andrew <unk> , with dolly grip David Jaxx <unk> and gaffer Steven <unk> . Later , for the scene when Walter meets with Mike at a bar , MacLaren backlit Walter as he entered so only his silhouette would be visible when he entered . When the shots of Mike punching Walter was originally filmed , the staging involved Mike standing up , then Walter standing up , then Mike suddenly punching him . Vince Gilligan edited the scene to have Mike simply punch Walter instead to make the action faster and more surprising . The scene was arranged by stunt coordinator Al Goto , and actors Bryan Cranston and Jonathan Banks performed the stunts themselves . Mike kicks Walter several times after he falls , and Goto placed a large sandbag against Cranston 's torso for Banks to kick during those scenes . 
 The party scenes at Jesse 's house sought to illustrate Jesse 's internal guilt and self @-@ hatred for having murdered Gale Boetticher in the third season finale , " Full Measure " . Gilligan said these scenes were written because he wanted to demonstrate that the actions of the characters in Breaking Bad have major consequences . The writing staff spent weeks discussing how Jesse would react to having killed Gale , and went with the course of events in " Thirty @-@ Eight Snub " in part because they felt it would be the most unexpected for the audience . Bryan Cranston praised these scenes , saying " I thought it was a great way to show a person going through a private hell . That everybody suffers , deals with their own personal loss in many different ways . " The scenes were shot on a set in a sound stage built by production designer Mark Freeborn and construction coordinator William Gilpin . Although scenes in Jesse 's house are occasionally filmed in an actual house , these particular scenes could not be shot there because the party was so messy . Breaking Bad music supervisor Thomas Golubic tried to select music appropriate for both the party and Jesse 's state of mind , using variations of punk rock , hip hop and dubstep . During one scene when Jesse , Skinny Pete and Badger are snorting meth together , Badger leans down outside of the shot to take the drugs , then Skinny Pete pops back up in a match cut . The shot was conceived by MacLaren during filming . 
 Mastras had Jesse buy a Roomba because he believed it was appropriate for Jesse 's frame of mind : " You don 't need it , it 's kind of inane . ... He 's just trying to fill his world with noise and with these things . " During the final shot of the episode , a steadicam shot filmed by Andrew <unk> , Jesse turns his stereo system all the way up and leans directly against the pulsating speaker to try to shut out his pain . MacLaren wanted the speakers to pulse , but they could not actually play loud music without harming actor Aaron Paul . The special effects crew unsuccessfully tried several methods to make the speakers pulse , such as shaking them and pulling on strings , but they did not appear realistic . It was achieved after MacLaren visited a local stereo store and an employee provided her a bass tester which would run the stereo system with no noise , but cause the speakers to pulse as if music was playing . That employee was hired to come on the set and run the system , and the lights and pulsing were timed to match music which was later dubbed in . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 Among the songs played by Jesse on his new sound system are " Money " by D / R Period , " Unga Bunga Bunga " by rapper Flavor Flav , " Raise Hell " by <unk> and " Digital Animal " by Honey Claws . During a scene at Jesse 's house , Badger and Skinny Pete debate which zombie video games are better , Left 4 Dead , Resident Evil 4 and Call of Duty : World at War : Zombies . The zombies in the latter game , which are also Nazis , are described by Badger as " the Talibans of the zombie world " . The unusually large pizza purchased for Jesse 's party is a reference to the third season episode " Caballo sin Nombre " , when Walter flung a pizza of the same type onto the roof of his house after an argument with Skyler .

 " Thirty @-@ Eight Snub " received very positive reviews . Entertainment Weekly writer Melissa Maerz compared the direction in " Thirty @-@ Eight Snub " to the film @-@ making of Sergio Leone , particularly in its " extreme close @-@ ups " , " tense silences " and the " saloon fight " between Walter and Mike . Time magazine writer James Poniewozik said the filming techniques used in Jesse 's party – " which starts off like a rap video then turns into some kind of distorted , jumpy tweak @-@ vision " – effectively conveyed Jesse 's frame of mind . He also liked the way the script conveyed Marie 's " increasing isolation " in dealing with Hank . Alan Sepinwall of HitFix called the episode a " terrific , unsettling hour " and particularly complimented director Michelle MacLaren and cinematographer Michael Slovis , especially for shooting Jesse 's party scenes " in a way that let you experience the chaos just as Jesse was trying to " . Sepinwall strongly praised Aaron Paul , who he said " keeps finding new layers of Jesse , and new talents to show them with " . New York magazine writer Logan Hill praised the film noir elements in the episode 's photography , and said the opening scene , with Walter staring into the mirror asking , " So , how 's it look ? " , refers to the season 's ongoing theme of internal self @-@ reflection and surveillance . Los Angeles Times writer Todd VanDerWerff said while the episode didn 't advance the plot very far , it included a great deal of internal development among the characters , which he called " an interesting new dynamic for the show to explore " . He also called Jesse 's emotional breakdown at the end " easily the most chilling thing so far this season " . 
 Paste magazine writer Brent Koepp called it " another incredible episode " and said the impending conflict between Walter and Gus " has the makings of one of television 's finest showdowns " . He also said the script made good use of the supporting characters , and that the growing distance between Hank and Marie was particularly well handled . Matt Seitz of Salon.com compared " Thirty @-@ Eight Snub " to excellent third season episodes that had " very few scenes and sequences but <unk> in them , allowing the characters ( and the viewer ) time to experience the tiny eddies and currents of the moment " . He also called an overhead shot of Walter standing outside Gus ' house alone " one of the best shots in the show 's history " . Tim Surette of TV.com especially praised the scene with Walter approaching Gus ' house , writing : " Breaking Bad has always been good at creating an air of tension , but now it seems as though the series has mastered it . He also said Paul 's acting during Jesse 's emotional breakdown " ripped my heart out and shredded it to pieces " . The Hollywood Reporter writer Tim Goodman said the photography and direction during Jesse 's party scenes was masterful : " Here we are four seasons into Breaking Bad and I shouldn 't still be amazed at the innovated visuals or perfectly honed sense of sound . These are masters at work , people . " Slate writers Jessica Grose and June Thomas both enjoyed the episode , although they found Walter 's character increasingly difficult to sympathize with . Both praised the scene when Mike attacked Walter , while Grose especially enjoyed Aaron Paul 's performance and Skyler 's subplot . 
 Matt Richenthal of TV Fanatic complimented the opening scene with the gun purchase , which he called " reminiscent of season one , when the show took the slow , fascinating steps that no other program would touch " . He also complimented the episodes for taking the viewers " inside the minds " of Walter and Jesse . Craig McQuinn of The Faster Times enjoyed the slow pace of the episode and complimented the show 's lack of predictability , claiming he had no idea how Walter 's confrontation with Gus would end , " and that ’ s why I love this show " . Michael Arbeiter of Hollywood.com compared the opening scene to the works of Quentin Tarantino , and called the bar Mike frequents " the most beautifully shot setting I 've seen in TV lately " . He also called the subplot between Marie and Hank a " surprisingly interesting story " . Carl Williott of CNN complimented the shows ' " clever pieces of misdirection " by having Walter purchase a gun but never getting to use it , and by showing Mike 's conflicted emotions but having him side with Gus against Walter . However , Williott said the episode ultimately felt like a " placeholder " for bigger developments in the storyline . Not all reviews were entirely positive . CraveOnline writer Blair Marnell said Walter 's near @-@ assassination of Gus was " the highlight of the episode " , but felt Jesse 's story was " less compelling [ and ] extremely repetitive " , and he found the subplot with Hank and Marie difficult to enjoy because Hank was so unsympathetic .

 Rørvik Airport , Ryum ( Norwegian : Rørvik lufthavn , Ryum ; IATA : <unk> , ICAO : <unk> ) is a regional airport located at <unk> , 6 kilometers ( 4 mi ) south of Rørvik , in the municipality of Vikna , Nord @-@ Trøndelag county , Norway . The airport is owned and operated by the state @-@ owned Avinor and serves the municipalities of Vikna and Nærøy . The airport has a 950 @-@ meter ( 3 @,@ 117 ft ) asphalt runway numbered 04 – 22 . Widerøe flies to the airport with its Bombardier Dash 8 aircraft on contract with the Ministry of Transport and Communications . The airport opened in 1986 as a municipal airport . It was first served by Norving , but Widerøe took over the flights in 1988 . The airport was nationalized in 1996 . Ryum served 33 @,@ 532 passengers in 2014 . 
 = = History = = 
 Plans for an airport with short take @-@ off and landing flights was launched by the government in December 1983 . The airport was proposed along with five other regionals airport : Fagernes Airport , Leirin ; Førde Airport , Bringeland ; Mosjøen Airport , Kjærstad ; Røst Airport and Værøy Airport . The plans were passed by Parliament on 10 April 1984 . Grants for starting construction were issued on the 1985 state budget and operating permission was issued by the government on 6 September 1985 . The financing was split between the state ( 60 percent ) , Vikna Municipality ( 30 percent ) and Nord @-@ Trøndelag County Municipality ( 10 percent ) . The municipal funding was financed through a loan in <unk> . Most of the state funding was granted on the 1986 state budget , along with three other airports . The original target was for 12 @,@ 000 passengers per year . 
 The airport was estimated to cost NOK 15 to 16 million , but the lowest tender was between NOK 10 and 11 million . The airport ended having severe cost overruns — NOK 12 million combined with Førde Airport . Ryum was scheduled to be opened on 1 October 1986 , but there was too bad weather that day that the ceremonies could take place , as aircraft could not land . Rørvik was initially served by Norving , which flew two services with the Dornier Do 228 : Bodø – Rørvik – Namsos – Trondheim and Rørvik – Brønnøysund Monday through Friday . During the first winter several shortcomings were found in the terminal building and temperatures down to − 6 ° C ( 21 ° F ) were measured indoors . 
 Norving announced on 10 December 1987 that they would terminate all operations outside Finnmark . This took effect on 8 January 1988 , leaving Rørvik without a scheduled services . Manning of the airport was reduced from eight to six , but the airport remained open from 08 to 23 . From the summer schedules of 1988 , Rørvik was included in Widerøe 's services along the Helgeland coast . The airport had 7 @,@ 244 passengers in 1988 , and the combined subsidies per passengers was NOK 511 . This included NOK 1 @.@ 3 million in state operating subsidies to the airport , in addition to an operating deficit of NOK 1 million covered by the municipality . 
 From 1996 , Ryum and 25 other regional airports were taken over by the state and the Civil Aviation Administration ( later renamed Avinor ) . The airport had 17 @,@ 000 passengers in 1999 . Four years after the nationalization , the CAA proposed that Ryum and certain other regional airport be closed in an effort to reduce costs , but this was disapproved by the government . The airport received a renewed certification by the Civil Aviation Authority in 2001 , which in addition to new runway lighting required the airport to have a rescue boat . The ministry started a process in 2001 to consider using smaller aircraft than the 37 @-@ seat Dash 8 aircraft . The reason was that there were on average only 17 passengers per flight from Rørvik and Namsos Airport , Høknesøra combined . Airport security was introduced on 1 January 2005 .

 Let 's Get It On is the thirteenth studio album by American recording artist Marvin Gaye , released August 28 , 1973 , on Tamla Records . Recording sessions for the album took place during June 1970 to July 1973 at Hitsville U.S.A. and Golden World Studio in Detroit , and at Hitsville West in Los Angeles . Serving as Gaye 's first venture into the funk genre and romance @-@ themed music , Let 's Get It On incorporates smooth soul , doo @-@ wop , and quiet storm . It has been noted by critics for its sexually suggestive lyrics , and was cited by one writer as " one of the most sexually charged albums ever recorded " . 
 Following the breakthrough success of his socially conscious album What 's Going On ( 1971 ) , Let 's Get It On helped establish Gaye as a sex icon and furthered his mainstream appeal . It produced three singles — the title track , " Come Get to This " , and " You Sure Love to Ball " — that attained Billboard chart success . Let 's Get It On became the most commercially successful album of Gaye 's recording career , and it further expanded his creative control during his tenure with Motown . Its sexual balladry , multi @-@ tracking of Gaye 's vocals , and seductive , funk sound influenced later R & B artists and production . 
 The album has been regarded by many music writers and critics as a landmark recording in soul music . It furthered funk music 's popularity during the 1970s , and its smooth soul sound marked a change for his record label 's previous success with the " Motown Sound " formula . Let 's Get It On has been ranked on many critics and publications ' lists of the best albums of all time . In 2001 , it was reissued by Motown Records as a two @-@ disc deluxe edition release .

 In the spring of 1972 , Marvin Gaye was suffering from writer 's block . Following the release of his most commercially successful album up to that point , What 's Going On ( 1971 ) , and the soundtrack album to the blaxploitation film Trouble Man ( 1972 ) , Gaye had struggled to come up with new material after Motown Records had renegotiated a new contract with him . The contract provided him with more creative control over his recordings . The deal was worth $ 1 million , making him the highest @-@ earning soul artist , as well as the highest @-@ earning black artist , at the time . He was also struggling with deciding whether or not to relocate to Los Angeles , following Motown @-@ CEO Berry Gordy 's move of the record label and replacement of the Detroit @-@ based Hitsville U.S.A. ( Motown Studio A ) recording studio with the Hitsville West studio in Los Angeles . Amid relocation and his lack of material , Gaye was struggling with his conscience , as well as dealing with expectations from his wife , Gordy 's sister Anna . Gaye 's separation from Gordy pressured him emotionally . During this time , he had also been attempting to cope with past issues that had stemmed from his childhood . 
 During his childhood , Gaye had been physically abused by his preacher father Marvin Gay , Sr. , who disciplined his son under extremely moralistic and fundamentalist Christian teachings . As a result , the meaning and practice of sex had later become a disturbing question for Gaye . As an adult , he suffered with sexual impotence and became plagued by sadomasochistic fantasies , which haunted him in his dreams and provoked some guilt in his conscience . According to Gaye 's biographer David Ritz , " his view of sex was unsettled , tormented , riddled with pain " . Gaye learned to cope with his personal issues with a newly found spirituality . He began incorporating his new outlook into his music , as initially expressed through the socially conscious album What 's Going On , along with promotional photos of him wearing a <unk> in honor of African traditional religions and his faith . 
 By winning over record executives with the success of What 's Going On , Gaye attained more creative control , which he would use , following his brief separation from wife Anna Gordy , to record an album that was meant to surface themes beyond sex . As with What 's Going On , Gaye wanted to have a deeper meaning than the general theme that was used to portray it ; in the case of the former , politics , and with its follow @-@ up effort , love and romance , which would be used by Gaye as a metaphor for God 's love . In his book Divided Soul : The Life of Marvin Gaye , David Ritz wrote of Gaye and the musical inspiration behind Gaye 's second landmark record : 
 If the most profound soul songs are prayers in secular dress , Marvin 's prayer is to reconcile the ecstasy of his early religious epiphany with a sexual epiphany . The hope for such a reconciliation , the search for sexual healing , is what drives his art ... The paradox is this : The sexiest of Marvin Gaye 's work is also his most spiritual . That 's the paradox of Marvin himself . In his struggle to wed body and soul , in his exploration of sexual passion , he expresses the most human of <unk> — the hunger for God . In those songs of loss and lament — the sense of separation is heartbreaking . On one level , the separation is between man and woman . On a deeper level , the separation is between man and God . 
 In the album 's liner notes , Gaye explained his views on the themes of sex and love , stating " I can 't see anything wrong with sex between consenting <unk> . I think we make far too much of it . After all , one 's genitals are just one important part of the magnificent human body ... I contend that SEX IS SEX and LOVE IS LOVE . When combined , they work well together , if two people are of about the same mind . But they are really two discrete needs and should be treated as such . Time and space will not permit me to expound further , especially in the area of the psyche . I don 't believe in overly moralistic philosophies . Have your sex , it can be exciting , if you 're lucky . I hope the music that I present here makes you lucky . "

 Gaye proceeded to record some more politically conscious material at the Golden World Records studio , known as Motown 's Studio B , as well as the preliminary vocals and instrumentation for some of the material to be featured on Let 's Get It On . Following the earlier sessions in Detroit at Golden World , Gaye recorded at Hitsville West in Los Angeles from February to July 1973 . Accompanied by an experienced group of session musicians called The Funk Brothers , who had contributed to Gaye 's What 's Going On , and received their first official credit , Gaye recorded the unreleased songs " The World is Rated X " and " Where Are We Going " and the single " You 're the Man " ( 1972 ) at Golden World . " Where Are We Going " was later covered by trumpeter Donald Byrd . Gaye had planned the release of an album titled You 're the Man , but it was later shelved for unknown reasons . The songs that were to be included on it , along with other unreleased recordings from Hitsville West and Golden World , were later featured on the 2001 re @-@ release of Let 's Get It On . 
 The album 's first recording , " Let 's Get It On " , was composed by Gaye with friend and former Motown label mate Ed Townsend . It was originally written by Gaye as a religious ode to life , but Motown singer @-@ songwriter Kenneth Stover re @-@ wrote it as a more political first draft . Upon hearing Gaye 's preliminary mix of Stover 's draft , Townsend protested and claimed that the song would be better suited with sexual and romantic overtones , particularly " about making sweet love . " Gaye and Townsend rewrote the song 's lyrics together with the original arrangements and musical accompaniment of the demo intact . The lyrics were inspired by Janis Hunter , whom Gaye had become infatuated with after meeting each other through Ed Townsend during the initial sessions . Townsend has cited Hunter 's presence during the album 's recording as an inspiration for Gaye . Gaye 's intimate relationship with Hunter subsequently became the basis for his 1976 album I Want You . While recording the title track , he was inspired to revive unfinished recordings from his 1970 sessions at the Hitsville U.S.A. Studio . 
 Townsend assisted Gaye with producing the rest of the album , whose recording took place at several sessions throughout 1970 to 1973 . They worked on four songs together , including the ballad " If I Should Die Tonight " , while Gaye composed most of the other songs , including those from past sessions . " Just to Keep You Satisfied " was originally recorded by several Motown groups , including The Originals and The Monitors , as a song dedicated to long @-@ standing love . With re @-@ recording the song , he had re @-@ written the arrangement and lyrics to address the demise of his volatile marriage to Anna Gordy Gaye , who happened to be the original song 's co @-@ writer . The background vocals for the album were sung by Gaye , with the exception of " Just to Keep You Satisfied " , which were done by The Originals . Most of the instrumentation for the album was done by members of The Funk Brothers , including bassist James Jamerson , guitarists Robert White and Eddie Willis , and percussionist Eddie " Bongo " Brown . Gaye also contributed on piano during the sessions . 
 = = Music and lyrics = = 
 " Let 's Get It On " features soulful , passionate lead vocals and multi @-@ tracked background singing , both by Gaye . It has a 1950s @-@ styled melody and begins with three wah @-@ wah guitar notes and centers on simple chord changes , while its arrangements are centered on an eccentric rhythm pattern . Its signature guitar line is played by session musician Don Peake . Music journalist Jon Landau dubs the song " a classic Motown single , endlessly repeatable and always enjoyable " . The song is reprised on the fourth track , " Keep Gettin ' It On " . It expands on the title track 's sensual theme with political overtones : " won 't you rather make love , children / as opposed to war , like you know you should . " 
 " Distant Lover " has Gaye crooning over serene instrumentation , leading to soulful screams near the end ; from a heartbroken croon to an impassioned wail . The song 's lyrics chronicled the yearning its narrator feels for a lover who is " so many miles away " , as he pleads for her return and laments the emptiness he feels without her . Music writer <unk> A. Guarisco later wrote of the song 's sound , in that " Marvin Gaye 's studio recording enhances the dreamy style of the song with stately horn and strings , tumbling drum fills that gently nudge the song along , and mellow , doo wop @-@ styled background vocals that echo " love her , you love her " under his romantic pleas . The song later became a concert favorite for Gaye and a live concert version , featuring female fans screaming in the background , was released as a single from his Marvin Gaye Live ! album in 1974 . 
 " You Sure Love to Ball " is one of Gaye 's most sexually overt and controversial singles , with its intro and outro featuring moaning sounds made by a man and woman engaged in sex . The sexual @-@ explicit and risqué nature of the album 's content were , at the time , controversial , and the recording of such an album was deemed as a commercial risk by Motown A & R 's ( Artists and Repertoire ) and label executives .

 Released on August 28 , 1973 , Let 's Get It On surpassed Gaye 's previous studio effort , What 's Going On , as the best @-@ selling record of his tenure with Motown . The album peaked at number two on the US Billboard Top LPs chart , succeeded by The Rolling Stones 's Goats Head Soup ( 1973 ) , while it also managed to reach number one in Cash Box for one week , as well as two weeks at the top of Record World 's music charts . Let 's Get It On charted for 61 weeks on the Billboard charts , and remained at the top of the Billboard Soul Albums for 11 weeks , becoming the best @-@ selling soul album of 1973 . The album 's lead single , " Let 's Get It On " , became one of Gaye 's most successful singles , as it reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100 chart on September 8 , 1973 . It remained at number one for two weeks , while also remaining at the top of the Billboard Soul Singles chart for eight weeks . On June 25 , 2007 , the Mastertone version of " Let 's Get It On , " which was released in 2004 , was certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America for one million downloads in the United States . 
 Two of the album 's singles reached the top 40 of the Billboard Hot 100 , including " Let 's Get It On " , which became Gaye 's second number @-@ one US single , and the top @-@ 30 hit " Come Get to This " , which peaked at number 23 on the chart . The album 's third single , " You Sure Love to Ball " , charted at number 50 on the Hot 100 and at number 13 on the Soul Singles chart . Along with the album 's music and sexual content , Let 's Get It On 's commercial success and promotion helped establish Marvin Gaye as a sex icon , while helping further expand his artistic control during his tenure at Motown . This commercial success also lead to a much publicized tour for Gaye to promote Let 's Get It On and expand on his repertoire as a live performer . Successful concert performances of the album 's material helped Gaye gain an increasing popularity and fan base in the pop market , while earning him a reputation as one of the top live performers of the time . His performance at the Oakland Coliseum during the 1973 @-@ 1974 tour was released on the 1974 LP Live ! , which would serve as Gaye 's only release during his sabbatical period in the mid @-@ 1970s . 
 Let 's Get It On received positive reviews from music critics . Billboard called it " fine in terms of vocal attack and material [ ... ] touches on the excellent in terms of instrumental support " , while citing the title track and " Distant Lover " as the album 's best recordings . Jon Landau of Rolling Stone found Gaye 's performance on @-@ par with that of What 's Going On and wrote that " he continues to transmit that same degree of intensity , sending out near cosmic overtones while eloquently phrasing the sometimes simplistic lyrics " . Although he viewed that it " lacks that album 's series of highpoints " , Landau commented that " it ebbs and flows , occasionally threatening to spend itself on an insufficiency of ideas , but always retrieved , just in time , by Gaye 's performance . From first note to last , he keeps pushing and shoving , and if he sometimes takes one step back for every two ahead , he gets there just the same — and with style and spirit to spare " . In Creem magazine , Robert Christgau called the album " post @-@ Al Green What 's Going On , which means it 's about fucking rather than the human condition , thank the wholly <unk> " . He found its title track to be " as much a masterpiece as ' Inner City Blues ' " and quipped , " this album prolongs its seductive groove to an appropriate thirty minutes plus " . 
 Since its initial reception , Let 's Get It On has been viewed by writers as a milestone in soul music . In The Best Rock ' n ' Roll Records of All Time , Jimmy Guterman writes that the album was " a bit more conventional musically ( soul crossing into mild funk ) and much more focused lyrically than its predecessor , What 's Going On " . Chicago Tribune writer Greg Kot commended Gaye for using " the multi @-@ tracked vocals perfected on ' What 's Going On ' , this time to convey his most intimate desires " , commenting that " while the album is replete with erotic imagery , both implied and explicit , it is also as much preoccupied with distance and unfulfilled need " . Jason Ankeny of Allmusic called it " a record unparalleled in its sheer sensuality and carnal energy " , writing that " Gaye 's passions reach their boiling point [ ... ] With each performance laced with innuendo , each lyric a come @-@ on , and each rhythm throbbing with lust , perhaps no other record has ever achieved the kind of sheer erotic force of Let 's Get It On " . Ankeny also dubbed it " one of the most sexually charged albums ever recorded . " Allmusic 's Lindsey Planer cites it as a " hedonistic R & B masterpiece . " BBC Music 's Daryl Easlea found Gaye " in supreme command of his material " , and viewed it as " much more than an album about simple lust " , but an " iconic , rapturous work " .

 Much like What 's Going On , Let 's Get It On has been included in a significant amount of " best album " lists by critics and publications . It was ranked number 58 on The Times 's 1993 publication of the 100 Best Albums of All Time . Blender magazine ranked the album number 15 on its list of the 100 Greatest American Albums of All Time . In 2003 , it was ranked number 165 on Rolling Stone 's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time publication , his second highest entry on the list , as well as one of three Marvin Gaye albums to be included ; What 's Going On ( number 6 ) and Here , My Dear ( number 462 ) . In 2004 , Let 's Get It On was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame and cited by The Recording Academy as a recording of " historical significance " . 
 = = Legacy and influence = = 
 Because of the album and its singles ' initial sales and response , Let 's Get It On marked a change and transition in sound and production for Motown , which had previously enjoyed success with its trademark " Motown Sound " . The label 's well @-@ known sound , however , was beginning to fade in popularity among the majority of R & B and soul listeners , while experiencing commercial pressure from contemporary styles that incorporated more diverse elements , such as Philly soul and funk . The Motown sound was typified by characteristics such as the use of tambourines to accent the back beat , prominent and often melodic electric bass guitar lines , distinctive melodic and chord structures , and a call and response singing style that originated in gospel music . In addition , pop production techniques were simpler than that of Gaye 's 1970s concept albums . Complex arrangements and elaborate , melismatic vocal riffs were avoided by Motown musicians . Following his breakthrough with What 's Going On , an " experiment in collating a pseudo @-@ classical suite of free @-@ flowing songs " , Gaye used his artistic control to modify the sound and incorporate funky instrumentation , melismatic vocalization , and heavy vocal multi @-@ tracking , in much contrast to the established production style at the label . In contrast to Motown 's previously successful process of emphasizing an artist 's single releases rather than their album , Gaye and fellow producer Ed Townsend followed a similar formula previously used on What 's Going On , in which the album 's songs flow together in a suite @-@ form arrangement , opposing label CEO Berry Gordy 's strong emphasis on hit single success . 
 The album also affirmed Gaye 's influence over later R & B styles and artists . Gaye 's change of musical style and production soon became contemporary and popular , prior to the disco era of the late 1970s . Several successful Motown artists , including Lionel Richie and Rick James , were influenced by many of the elements of Gaye 's recording style for their work in the late 1970s and early 1980s . The slow jam sound and contemporary R & B production in general were greatly influenced by the album 's use of vocal multi @-@ tracking and instrumentation . Allmusic calls the album " the blueprint for all of the slow jams to follow decades later — much copied , but never imitated . " Renown engineer Russell Elevado 's work in the neo soul genre , including his production for D 'Angelo 's Voodoo ( 2000 ) and Erykah Badu 's Mama 's Gun ( 2000 ) , has been influenced by Gaye 's and Townsend 's production techniques and sound . 
 The music atmosphere of the 1970s was heavily influenced by its success and sexual content , as its sexual @-@ explicitness bent creative barriers in the music industry and led to an increased popularity of sexual themes in music at the time . Music writer Rob Bowman later cited Let 's Get It On as " one of the most erotic recordings known to mankind . " The album 's success helped spark a series of similarly styled releases by such smooth soul artists as Barry White ( Can 't Get Enough ) , Smokey Robinson ( A Quiet Storm ) and Earth , Wind & Fire ( That 's the Way of the World ) . The commercial success of such recording artists led to a change of trend from socially conscious aesthetics to more mainstream , sensually themed music . Gaye himself experienced subsequent success with his follow @-@ up release I Want You ( 1976 ) , featuring more sexually explicit lyrics and expanded use of vocal multi @-@ tracking , and with Here , My Dear ( 1978 ) , which he based entirely on his tumultuous marriage to Anna Gordy . In an interview with music author Michael Eric Dyson , hip hop artist Q @-@ Tip discussed the album 's influence and significance to its time period , stating : 
 Although there was a ' conscious ' revolution , there was also a great sexual revolution ... I think Let 's Get It On was Marvin wanting to make commentary on what was happening . I think there was a big ' love @-@ in ' that was going on . And with him quoting T.S. Elliot [ in his liner notes , that life amounts to " Birth , copulation and death " ] , and the young lady moaning [ on the album ] , we hadn 't heard that before . That was another first , as well as him capturing erotica like that , and weaving it into the music the way he did ; it was mind blowing . I think it was a natural progression , because we were having a revolution with our minds , and then with our bodies at that time . 
 Following the success of funk records such as Sly and the Family Stone 's There 's a Riot Goin ' On ( 1971 ) and James Brown 's late 1960s and early 1970s singles , Gaye 's Let 's Get It On helped further the funk genre 's reach and influence in the music industry , as well as increase its mainstream appeal . Several contemporary R & B musicians , such as Prince , D 'Angelo , and R. Kelly , were greatly influenced by its vintage sound and seductive themes , incorporating much of Gaye 's musical style into their music .

 = SS Arctic disaster = 
 The paddle steamer SS Arctic , owned by the Collins Line of New York , sank on September 27 , 1854 , after a collision with SS Vesta , a much smaller vessel , 50 miles ( 80 km ) off the coast of Newfoundland . Passenger and crew lists indicate that there were probably more than 400 on board ; of these , only 88 survived , most of whom were members of the crew . All the women and children on board perished . 
 Arctic was the largest and most celebrated of the four Collins steamers that had operated a regular transatlantic passenger and mail carrying service since 1850 . After the collision Arctic 's captain , James Luce , first attempted to assist the stricken Vesta , which he believed was in imminent danger of sinking . When he discovered that his own ship had been seriously holed below the waterline , he decided to run her towards the nearest land , in the hopes of reaching safety . His plan failed ; the engines stopped when the ship was still far from land . Arctic 's lifeboat capacity was sufficient for less than half of those on board ; when Luce ordered these launched , a breakdown in order and discipline meant that most places in the boats were taken by members of the crew or the more able @-@ bodied male passengers . The rest struggled to build makeshift rafts , but most were unable to leave the ship , and went down with her when she sank , four hours after the collision . Vesta , which initially appeared to have sustained mortal damage , was kept afloat by her watertight bulkheads , and managed to limp into harbor at St. John 's , Newfoundland . 
 Two of the six lifeboats that left Arctic reached the Newfoundland shore safely , and another was picked up by a passing steamer , which also rescued a few survivors from improvised rafts . Among those saved was Captain Luce , who had regained the surface after initially going down with the ship . The other three lifeboats disappeared without a trace . The limited telegraph facilities of the time meant that news of Arctic 's loss did not reach New York until two weeks after the sinking . Initial public sorrow at the ship 's loss quickly turned to anger at the perceived cowardice of the crew . Despite press calls for a full investigation into the disaster , none took place , and nobody was held legally responsible . Demands for the introduction of further safety measures on passenger @-@ carrying vessels were likewise sidestepped . Luce , who was generally exonerated from blame by the public , retired from the sea ; some of the surviving crew chose not to return to the US . The Collins Line continued its transatlantic service , until further maritime losses and insolvency led to its closure in 1858 .

 = = = Transatlantic shipping = = = 
 In the first decades of the 19th century the transatlantic shipping trade was revolutionized by the development of long @-@ range steamships . The transition from sail was gradual ; shipowners were initially influenced by popular theories that ships could not carry sufficient coal to traverse the ocean . This notion was disproved in 1838 , by the almost simultaneous crossings of Isambard Kingdom Brunel 's giant paddle steamer SS Great Western and the American SS Sirius . Great Western completed the crossing , from Bristol to New York , in 14 days and 12 hours ; under sail , westbound passages against the prevailing winds and current often took five weeks or more . 
 The first shipping line to begin regular transatlantic steamer services was the British and North American Royal Mail Steam Packet Company , better known as the Cunard Line in recognition of its founder , the Canadian Samuel Cunard . It began its operations on July 4 , 1840 , when RMS Britannia left Liverpool for Boston , via Halifax , Nova Scotia . As the principal transatlantic mail carrier , the Cunard Line received subsidies from the British government and from the United States Post Office Department , the latter a point that rankled with some Americans , who felt that a home @-@ owned line should be the beneficiary . Senator James A. Bayard of Delaware was among those urging Congress to subsidize a US steamship line : " America will soon become tired of being informed of British maritime supremacy ... I suggest that Congress grant a carefully selected American shipping expert a completely free hand to proceed with the absolute conquest of this man Cunard " . In 1845 the postmaster general invited tenders for a transatlantic mail contract . The successful bidder , announced on March 3 , 1847 , was New York shipowner Edward Knight Collins . 
 = = = Collins Line = = = 
 With government subsidies promised , initially at $ 385 @,@ 000 a year , and with the backing of the leading investment bank Brown Brothers , Collins founded the New York and Liverpool United States ' Mail Steamship Company , familiarly known as the Collins Line . He immediately embarked on an ambitious steamship construction program . The first of the four Collins Line ships , SS Atlantic , was launched in 1849 and began service in April 1850 . Her three sister ships , Pacific , Arctic and Baltic , were all in service before the end of 1850 . The four , all constructed of wood , were broadly similar in size and performance ; Arctic was marginally the largest , at 284 feet ( 87 m ) in length and 2 @,@ 856 tons by American custom house measurement . The new Collins Line steamers were about 25 percent larger than the biggest of the Cunard ships , and were soon outperforming them ; crossings in ten days became routine . Arctic entered service on October 26 , 1850 . The luxurious standards of its passenger accommodation contrasted with those experienced by Charles Dickens , who crossed the Atlantic in Cunard 's Britannia in 1840 . Dickens found his Britannia cabin dark and cramped , " a thoroughly hopeless , and profoundly preposterous box " , while the bleak saloon was " a long narrow apartment , not unlike a gigantic hearse " . In Arctic , according to a seasoned transatlantic passenger , her cabins " in comfort and elegance surpassed that of any merchant vessel Great Britain then possessed " , while the main saloon had " an air of almost Oriental magnificence " . 
 Under her captain , James Luce , a 49 @-@ year @-@ old veteran of thirty years at sea , Arctic became the most celebrated of the Collins ships . Her record eastbound crossing , from New York to Liverpool in nine days , seventeen hours in the winter of 1851 – 52 , earned her the title of the " Clipper of the Seas " . Luce was admired by passengers as much for his social qualities as for his seamanship ; a reporter for Harper 's New Monthly Magazine wrote approvingly : " If you ever wish to cross the Atlantic , you will find in the Arctic one of the noblest of ships , and in Captain Luce one of the best of commanders " .

 = = = Liverpool to the Grand Banks = = = 
 At about midday on September 20 , 1854 , Arctic left Liverpool for New York , carrying between 250 and 300 passengers ( including at least 100 women and young children ) , and about 150 crew . Among the passengers was Mrs. Edward Collins , wife of the line 's founder , who was traveling with her 19 @-@ year @-@ old daughter and 15 @-@ year @-@ old son , together with her brother and his wife . Another party was formed by members of the Brown banking family : William Benedict Brown , son of the bank 's president , was accompanied by his wife Clara , their two infant children , and two of William 's sisters . A further passenger was Luce 's partially disabled 11 @-@ year @-@ old son , William Robert , whose health the captain thought might benefit from the round trip . 
 Arctic passed Cape Clear , at the southernmost point of Ireland , early on the morning of September 21 , and entered the open Atlantic approaching her maximum speed of 13 knots ( 15 mph ) . In settled weather she progressed uneventfully , and early on September 27 had reached the location of the Grand Banks , off the coast of Newfoundland . This area is formed by a series of relatively shallow submarine plateaus forming part of the Canadian continental shelf . Here , the sub @-@ Arctic waters of the Labrador Current meet the warm northbound waters of the Gulf Stream , to create weather systems typified by intermittent mists and fog . It was the practice for steamers to maintain maximum speeds in these conditions , although before electronic aids to navigation the risk of collision was considerable . Keeping schedules was considered paramount , particularly in the Collins Line where , Alexander Brown states in his 1962 account , " there was no room for overcautious <unk> " . On the morning of September 27 , Luce observed typical Grand Banks conditions : " at intervals of a few minutes a very dense fog , followed by being sufficiently clear to see one or two miles . " 
 = = = Collision = = = 
 At noon on September 27 , Luce calculated the ship 's position at roughly 50 miles ( 80 km ) south @-@ east of Cape Race , in Newfoundland . Shortly afterwards , as Arctic slipped into a bank of fog , the lookout saw the shape of a steamer bearing down at a rate of around 10 knots . He gave the warning ; the officer of the watch commanded " Hard @-@ a @-@ starboard " , and ordered the engine room to stop and reverse . In the chartroom , the captain heard these orders and returned to the deck , just as Arctic was struck by the advancing steamer on the starboard side , between the bow and the paddle wheel . Luce 's first impression was that his ship was " relatively uninjured " , and to most of those on board , the bump seemed slight . Many of the passengers were gathered in the cabin prior to lunch , and some of them were engaged in drawing the numbers of the daily lottery , based on the number of miles run in the preceding twenty @-@ four hours . 
 In the saloon , passenger William Gihon " perceived a slight shock , although it was scarcely more than a tremor or a quiver " . He continued his conversation with a fellow @-@ passenger : " Neither of us entertained any idea at that time that the Arctic had sustained injury " . 
 The steamer which had collided with Arctic was SS Vesta , an iron @-@ hulled propeller @-@ driven French ship used by a major fishing operator to ferry its employees to and from their center of operations at Saint Pierre Island , Newfoundland . To those on Arctic 's deck , Vesta appeared to be fatally damaged ; Luce thought her bows " seemed to be literally cut or crushed off for full ten feet " . His first reaction , believing his own ship almost untouched , was to assist Vesta , on which scenes of panic and chaos among the 200 @-@ odd sailors and fishermen aboard her were evident . He ordered his chief officer , Robert Gourlay , to lower one of Arctic 's six lifeboats with a crew of six , and to ascertain what help could be offered ; meanwhile , Arctic slowly circled the stricken vessel . Gourlay 's boat was quickly away , and another was prepared for launching , under second officer William Baalham , but before this could be done Luce rescinded the order . He had noticed a change in the movement of Arctic 's paddle wheels through the water and saw also that the ship was listing , signs of potentially serious damage . Baalham was ordered to make a closer inspection of the point of impact ; he found that debris from Vesta 's iron stem and anchor were impaled in the woodwork of Arctic 's hull , creating substantial holes about eighteen inches above the water @-@ line . Two breaches were below the waterline , admitting large quantities of water . Unlike Vesta , Arctic was not equipped with watertight compartments ; the hull was open from stem to stern . 
 = = = Confusion and panic = = = 
 = = = = Dash for land = = = = 
 As Baalham made his inspection , others observed the extent of the damage , and a mood of concern and anxiety began to develop as news spread . With the ship 's four pumps working at full capacity , Luce attempted to <unk> the leak by passing a large canvas sail over the ship 's bow . This , he hoped , could be fastened over the holes in the hull to lessen the inflow of water , but the jagged iron debris protruding from the hull quickly tore the sail apart . The ship 's carpenter tried to stuff the breaches with mattresses and other materials , but the holes were by then too far below the waterline to be reached . Realizing that his ship was in serious danger of sinking , Luce decided to run for the nearest land , in the hopes of reaching safety while Arctic was still afloat ; Cape Race was about four hours distant , if the ship could be kept moving . This decision meant abandoning Vesta , but Luce rationalized that the French vessel was likely to sink at any moment , and that remaining with her might well condemn his own passengers and crew to the same fate . After vainly attempting to signal his intention to Gourlay and his crew , who were being left to fend for themselves , Luce ordered full speed ahead . A few minutes later , Arctic ploughed into a lifeboat that had been launched from Vesta . All but one of its dozen occupants were killed , mostly crushed under Arctic 's paddle wheels . The single survivor was a fisherman , François Jassonet , who jumped clear and was hauled aboard Arctic by a rope . 
 = = = = Boats launched = = = = 
 As the water in Arctic 's hull continued to rise , outstripping the pumps , the boiler fires were gradually extinguished . By one o 'clock the ship was scarcely moving . Still far from land , and with no help nearby , Luce ordered that the ship 's lifeboats be prepared for launching , In accordance with the governing maritime regulations , Arctic carried six steel @-@ constructed boats , one of which had departed with Gourlay . The five remaining boats could safely hold 150 persons , well under half of those on board but with more than enough places to hold all the women and children . Under the charge of the ship 's quartermaster , women and children were placed in the port guard boat , but as this orderly process proceeded , a group of male passengers and crew members rushed forward to claim the remaining places , and the boat was filled . Although ordered by the captain to remain alongside , it was rowed rapidly away . 
 On board Arctic , disquiet turned increasingly into panic as it became clear that lifeboat capacity was inadequate . Shortly after the port guard boat 's departure , the port quarter boat , with around twelve women and five crew aboard , was being readied for lowering into the water when it , too , was rushed by members of the crew . In the general melee the boat was upended , sending all but three of its occupants into the water , where they drowned . On the other side of the ship , Luce ordered Second Officer Baalham to launch the starboard guard boat and proceed with it to the stern , where women and children passengers would be passed down . No sooner was it launched when it was overwhelmed by men , who leapt into the water and clambered into the boat ; all but one of these were crew members . With his boat now full , Baalham disregarded Luce 's instructions to pick up women and children , and drifted away . Meanwhile , the upended port quarter boat had been righted , but despite Luce 's efforts to give women passengers priority , it was again rushed by crew and male passengers , who thrust aside the waiting women and cut the boat adrift from the ship while it was only partially filled . 
 While the captain 's attention was fully occupied in vain attempts to impose order , a group of the ship 's engineers , led by Chief Engineer J. W. Rogers , quietly appropriated one of the two remaining lifeboats . They maintained they required the boat for a final attempt at plugging the leaks ; anyone who questioned their intentions , or attempted to board the boat , was threatened with firearms . With ample food and water , this boat left the ship half full , occupied entirely by engine room staff . Of the ship 's officers only Luce and Fourth Officer Francis Dorian now remained ; virtually all the engineers and seamen had left . Around 300 people were still on board , with a single lifeboat . As a final measure to give at least some of these a chance of survival , Luce ordered the building of a raft . The fore and main yardarms , with various beams , spars and other wooden artifacts , were collected and lowered into the sea where Dorian , in the remaining boat , attempted to supervise the raft 's construction . Despite Dorian 's entreaties , his boat was rapidly overwhelmed ; to save it he cut loose , leaving a final terrified scramble for whatever security the half @-@ finished raft could provide . Among those who found safety in Dorian 's boat was a fireman , Patrick Tobin . According to his later account : " It was every man for himself . No more attention was paid to the captain than to any other man on board . Life was as sweet to us as to others " . 
 = = = Sinking = = = 
 With Arctic dead in the water , Luce instructed a young trainee engineer , Stewart Holland of Washington , to station himself at the bow and to fire the ship 's signal cannon at one @-@ minute intervals , in the hope of attracting the attention of a passing vessel . Throughout the chaos of the ship 's final moments Holland held his position and continued to fire until the moment the ship sank . His bravery and devotion to duty were noted in several later accounts : the Baltimore Sun called him " a conqueror of death . That noble ship had many noble spirits on board — but none nobler than he " . 
 Luce refused to take any action to save himself — he had told Baalham , before the second officer 's departure , that " the fate of the ship shall be mine " . When he could no longer render assistance to those still on board , he climbed with his young son to his command post atop the starboard paddle box , and waited for the end . By this time , many on board had become resigned to their fate ; they huddled together for comfort while some sang hymns or recited scripture . A few still frantically sought for means of survival ; those who could not find a place on the raft lashed together anything that might float — chairs , stools , caskets , sofas and doors , while Holland continued to fire the cannon . Peter McCabe , a waiter on his first transatlantic voyage , later described the scene : " Several persons were floating about on doors and beds ... I seized hold of a door which had been taken down to save passengers , and went into the sea , where I left the door and got upon the raft ... A great many persons were trying to get on the raft ... Among the number who were on it I saw four ladies " . Many were lost from the raft when it fouled the sinking hull — a section broke off , spilling its occupants into the sea . After this , McCabe counted seventy @-@ two men and four women either on or clinging to the structure , as it moved slowly away from the ship . 
 At around 4 : 45 pm , four and a half hours after the collision , Holland fired the cannon for the final time , as Arctic sank stern @-@ first . There were still perhaps 250 persons on board . As the ship went down , Paul <unk> from New York , in Dorian 's boat , heard " one fearful shriek , and saw the passengers swept forward against the smokestack , and then all was over " . Luce , holding tightly to his child , was dragged deep down by the suction of the sinking vessel . When he rose to the surface , " a most awful and heart @-@ rending scene presented itself to my view — over two hundred men , women and children struggling together amidst pieces of wreck of every kind , calling on each other for help , and imploring God to assist them . Such an appalling scene may God preserve me from ever witnessing again . " As he struggled , a section of one of Arctic 's paddle @-@ boxes rose to the surface , delivering him a glancing blow but striking and killing his son outright . Despite the shock , Luce was able to clamber on to the paddle @-@ box , which provided a temporary raft for him and eleven others .

 A short distance from the foundering ship , Baalham 's boat encountered the partly filled port quarter boat . The loads were equalized , and the two vessels , with 45 persons in all , agreed to proceed under Baalham 's overall command . After briefly considering — and rejecting — a suggestion that they should look for other survivors , the two <unk> boats began rowing in the direction of the Newfoundland coast . Without an adequate compass , Baalham navigated by the run of the sea and occasional glimpses of the stars . Many of these survivors were freezing through extensive immersion in the bitterly cold water , about 45 ° Fahrenheit ; nevertheless , they rowed through the night and the next day . Twice they sighted ships in the distance , but were not seen . Early on the morning of September 29 they were close to the shoreline of Newfoundland 's Avalon Peninsula , and shortly afterwards the two boats landed at Broad Cove , about 50 miles ( 80 km ) south of St John 's . 
 After a brief respite , the party moved on to <unk> , a fishing village four miles ( six km ) to the north . There , Arctic 's purser , John Geib , wrote a short message for dispatch by courier to the American consul in St John 's , informing him of the collision . Baalham hired two schooners ; in one , he returned with two others to the location of the sinking , to search for other survivors . In the other , the rest of the group sailed for St John 's . When they arrived , during the afternoon of October 2 , they were surprised to find Vesta , safely moored in the harbor . Despite the serious damage to its bow , Vesta 's watertight bulkheads had held firm , enabling the ship to proceed slowly to St John 's with almost her complete complement on board . Her arrival , on September 30 , had provided the basis of the first , inaccurate report of the disaster , in the local Patriot and Terra Nova Herald newspaper , in which it was assumed that Arctic had survived . The Arctic survivors ' reception in St John 's was cool , as following Vesta 's arrival the perception had been that Arctic had displayed what William <unk> , in his account of the disaster , terms a " hit and run " attitude . 
 Baalham arrived on October 3 , following a fruitless three @-@ day search for survivors . The text of Geib 's brief letter to the American consul appeared in that day 's edition of the St John 's Newfoundlander , while its rival newspaper The Public Ledger printed a more detailed account of the disaster provided by Baalham . Because St John 's lacked a telegraph service , these reports had to be taken by the steamer Merlin to Halifax , Nova Scotia , where they could be wired to New York . Most of the Arctic party traveled on the same steamer ; Geib remained in St John 's , on the chance that further survivors might arrive . Merlin detoured to cover the area of the sinking , but discovered nothing ; she then proceeded to Sydney , Nova Scotia and reached Halifax on October 11 . 
 Numerous efforts were launched from St John 's in the hope of finding more survivors . An English schooner , John Clements , spent a week searching , before returning with Arctic 's flagstaff but no personnel . The New York , Newfoundland and London Telegraph Company , owners of the steamer Victoria , offered their vessel to the US consul for a fee of $ 500 a day , an action which led to considerable local press criticism . By contrast , the Bishop of Newfoundland , the Right Revd Edward Feild , provided his private yacht Hawk free of charge . Eventually Victoria agreed to assist without payment , although an unnamed correspondent of the Public Ledger doubted whether the ship made more than a perfunctory search . None of the ships other than John Clements found any definite traces of Arctic . Some reported that they had sighted debris , but were not able to identify or recover it . 
 = = = Huron , Lebanon , and Cambria = = = 
 Dorian 's lifeboat was the smallest of the ship 's boats and , with 26 crew and 5 passengers on board , had only a few inches of freeboard . In worsening weather , Dorian improvised a rough sea anchor , which enabled the boat to ride the waves through the night and following day without being swamped . In the late afternoon of September 28 they sighted a distant sail , which proved to be the Canadian bark Huron , bound for Quebec . As they rowed towards their rescuer , they passed Peter McCabe , still clinging to the makeshift raft , the only one of its 72 occupants to have survived the night ; he , too was taken on board Huron . McCabe later recalled that he thought he was within ten minutes of death when he was rescued . 
 On the following day Huron encountered another sailing ship , the Lebanon , heading for New York . Dorian , the five passengers and twelve of the crew chose to transfer to Lebanon . The other crewmen , possibly anticipating a hostile reception in their home port , chose to remain with Huron and proceed to Quebec , where she arrived on October 13 . 
 The ordeal of Captain Luce , and others who survived on assorted wreckage , lasted for two days . Around noon on September 29 , the sailing ship Cambria , out of Glasgow and heading for Quebec , spotted François Jassonet , the Vesta fisherman who had been rescued by the Arctic after the collision . In the following few hours , Cambria picked up nine more survivors ; these included Luce and two companions , the only survivors of the eleven who had found refuge on the remains of the <unk> . The last to be picked up by Cambria was James Smith , a businessman from Scotland , who had survived on a raft constructed from planking and a tin @-@ lined wicker basket . He had seen at least one ship pass in the distance during his ordeal , and had almost given up hope when Cambria arrived . Once satisfied there were no further survivors in the area , Cambria continued its journey to Quebec . Luce spent much of the voyage preparing a report of the disaster , ready to wire to Edward Collins in New York as soon as he reached land . Cambria arrived in Quebec on October 13 , a few hours after Huron . 
 The fates of three of Arctic 's lifeboats are unknown : the starboard quarter boat in which Gourlay left to assist Vesta just after the collision ; the port guard boat , launched under the control of the quartermaster ; and the forward deck boat , appropriated by Rogers and his associates . No trace of the occupants of these boats was ever found . In mid @-@ November 1854 , Gourlay 's empty boat was picked up by the schooner Lily Dale , in good condition and with its oars still inside . In mid @-@ December the port guard boat was washed ashore at Placentia Bay , Newfoundland , again with no indication of the fate of its occupants . 
 = = New York = = 
 New York first heard of the disaster on October 11 , with the arrival of the survivors rescued by the Lebanon . Later that day , Baalham 's report , telegraphed from Halifax , was received at the Collins offices . The men from the Lebanon were seized upon by the press ; their stories , and the details from Baalham 's wired account , formed the basis of the early newspaper accounts . At that stage , information was incomplete ; Luce was missing and presumed lost , and there were various speculations about the numbers of casualties . The New York Herald 's headline announced : " Between Three and Four Hundred Souls <unk> " , and : " Only Thirty @-@ two Lives Known to be Saved " . On the basis of the sketchy telegraphs from Halifax , the Baltimore Sun printed the false story that Vesta had saved 31 from Arctic 's complement and brought them into St John 's . This confusion temporarily raised hopes that the number saved might be higher than was immediately apparent , but this hope was dashed when , on the following day , some of Baalham 's party from St John 's arrived in New York , via Halifax and Boston , with their more detailed accounts . 
 On October 13 , Luce 's telegraphed report from Quebec was received at the Collins New York office . The news of his survival was the cause of celebration and thanksgiving . In its first paragraph Luce informed Edward Collins that the lost passengers likely " included your wife , daughter and son , with whom I took a last leave the moment the ship was going down " . That day , the Baltimore Sun reported the loss of the entire Brown party . Luce 's account of the rushing of lifeboats , and the early departures of officers and crew , caused considerable consternation in New York , which quickly turned to anger and condemnation as it became apparent that no women or children had been saved , and that most of the survivors were from the crew . The New York Times reported " an entire lack of disciplined control over the whole of the ship " , and that " the officers and crew did not do their best towards saving the vessel , which they left too early " . Paul <unk> , from Dorian 's boat , reported that " all order and discipline ceased on board " , and that Rogers had threatened passengers with firearms . Later press accounts condemned the crew in increasingly harsh terms ; The New York Times referred to " a ghastly desertion of duty " , and condemned the " cowardly and dastardly conduct of the crew " . Scientific American adjudged that the behavior of the crew in saving themselves before their passengers had " blackened the character of our marine in the eyes of the whole world " . Captain Luce , however , was largely exculpated ; he had not sought to save himself , had gone down with his ship , and had survived largely by chance . When he arrived in New York by train from Quebec , on October 14 , he was greeted as a hero . 
 The probable number of survivors from SS Arctic is 88 , of whom 24 ( including the French fisherman François Jassonet ) were passengers . This figure comprises 45 in Baalham 's Newfoundland party , 32 rescued by Huron , 10 picked up by Cambria , and a passenger , Thomas Fleury , whose survival was not known until 1860 . Alexander Brown names 85 survivors , but includes only 42 from Baalham 's party . David Shaw , writing in 2002 , gives the total who survived as 87 , but does not count Fleury . In the absence of accurate passenger and crew lists , it has not been possible to establish the precise number of casualties ; on the basis of published partial lists , <unk> estimates the death toll as not less than 285 , and conceivably as high as 372 . Some accounts give inflated casualty figures ; for example , W. H. <unk> in 1896 asserts that " five hundred and sixty @-@ two persons perished " . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 After a week of reports chiefly concerned with survival accounts and tributes , on October 18 The New York Times turned to " Lessons Concerning Means of Security on Ocean Steamers " . Among several recommendations were : the compulsory use of steam whistles or trumpets as fog signals ; the construction of permanent watertight bulkheads in all passenger @-@ carrying ships ; organized lifeboat drills for passengers ; better discipline and more training among seamen . Few of these suggested reforms were adopted immediately ; calls for steamships sailing under the US flag to carry sufficient lifeboats for everyone on board were resisted until after the loss of RMS Titanic 58 years later . In December 1854 The New York Times called for an official enquiry into the disaster : " Whatever may be the extent of their legal responsibility , the owners , the officers and the crew of the Arctic are responsible to the public judgment ... They have no right to resist any attempt that may be made to define the extent of that responsibility , nor to deprecate any degree of scrutiny into their conduct " . No such investigation was ever instituted , and no one was taken to court for their actions . Some of the crewmen who landed in Quebec avoided questions by not returning to the United States ; according to Shaw they " disappeared on the waterfronts along the St Lawrence River and found the obscurity they wanted " . 
 Luce never went to sea again . The sympathy that greeted him on his return to New York did not prevent later criticism , that he had not acted forcefully enough and had , according to the crewman Tobin , " seemed like a man whose judgment was paralyzed " . The captain accepted that his abandonment of Gourlay had been a grave error ; the first officer might well have supervised a more disciplined organization of the lifeboats . Luce took a post as an inspector of ships with the Great Western Marine Insurance Company , where he worked until his death in 1879 , in his 75th year . His obituarist recorded that " his latter years were embittered by the recollection of the terrible disaster " . The Collins Line continued its fortnightly transatlantic mail steamship service with its three remaining ships , but suffered a further blow when , in January 1856 , SS Pacific sank with her entire complement of 186 passengers and crew . Nevertheless Collins went ahead with the construction of an even larger ship , the SS Adriatic , which , after a single round trip in November – December 1857 , was laid up . Confidence in the line had been damaged ; " people concluded that getting there was more important than <unk> amid ornate trim " , and public opinion was increasingly averse to the payment of government subsidies to finance the Collins Line 's luxurious voyages . Early in 1858 , when these subsidies were heavily cut back , the line ceased business , and the Cunard ships resumed their position of transatlantic supremacy . Vesta , fully repaired , remained in the service of various owners until 1875 when , renamed <unk> , she is recorded as sinking in Santander harbor . 
 Among memorials to those lost from Arctic , a stone pillar was erected next to Luce 's grave , in the Center cemetery at Wareham , Massachusetts , to honor 11 @-@ year @-@ old Willie Luce , who had died at his father 's side as the ship sank . James Brown of Brown Brothers bank built an elaborate monument in Green @-@ Wood Cemetery , Brooklyn , to commemorate the six members of his family who had drowned . It incorporates a sculpture of Arctic at the moment of her sinking . An anonymous poetic tribute was printed in the New York Herald of October 22 , 1854 . It includes the words : 
 It ends with the warning : " Vengeance , saith the Lord , is mine " . 
 = St Chad 's Church , Poulton @-@ le @-@ Fylde = 
 St Chad 's Church is an Anglican church in Poulton @-@ le @-@ Fylde , a town on the Fylde coastal plain in Lancashire , England . It is an active parish church in the Diocese of Blackburn and the archdeaconry of Lancaster . It is recorded in the National Heritage List for England as a designated Grade II * listed building . A church on the site was built no later than the 11th century and may have existed prior to the Norman conquest of England . The tower dates from the 17th century , and much of the remainder of the building from a major renovation in the 18th century , although some of the fabric of the original structure remains . Further renovation and additions took place in the 19th , 20th and 21st centuries . 
 Soon after the Norman conquest , Poulton was granted to Lancaster Priory . In the 15th century , the church was given by Henry V to Syon Monastery in Middlesex . It returned to the Crown following the Dissolution of the Monasteries and from the 16th to the 20th century , the advowson ( the right to appoint a parish priest ) A belonged to the Hesketh / Fleetwood family . 
 The red sandstone building is faced with grey ashlar and consists of a nave , chancel , square tower and a Norman @-@ style apse . Its furnishings include a Georgian staircase , a Jacobean pulpit , box pews and hatchments . There are eight bells in the tower . Outside the church are the remains of a stone preaching cross . 
 = = History = = 
 There has probably been a church on the site of the present St Chad 's since before the Norman conquest of England in 1066 , and there is written evidence of one from 1094 . The Domesday Book of 1086 mentioned three churches in the hundred of Amounderness , although they were not named . Later documentary evidence suggests that they were probably the churches at Poulton , Kirkham and St Michael 's on Wyre . The dedication of Poulton 's church to 7th century Anglo @-@ Saxon saint Chad of Mercia lends weight to its pre @-@ conquest foundation , although it is possible that it was built between 1086 and 1094 . 
 The first documentary evidence of Poulton 's church dates from 1094 . After the conquest Amounderness , which included Poulton , was among the lands given by William the Conqueror to an Anglo @-@ Norman knight named Roger the Poitevin . In 1094 , Roger founded the Benedictine priory of St. Mary at Lancaster , as an offshoot of the Abbey of St. Martin in Sées , Normandy . He endowed the priory with the church and land at Poulton , approximately 20 miles ( 32 km ) away . Roger was eventually banished from the country and his possessions reverted to the Crown . In 1194 the hundred of Amounderness was given by King Richard I to Theobald Walter , 1st Baron Butler who became the High Sheriff of Lancashire . Though the advowson of Poulton ( the right to select a parish priest ) had been granted by Roger to the monks of Lancaster , Theobald initially thought that it should be included in his <unk> In 1196 he relinquished his right to Poulton ( along with that of Bispham ) , although he kept the advowsons of Preston and Kirkham . 
 In 1275 the Lancaster monks installed a vicar at the church . In 1291 , taxation assessments made on behalf of Pope Nicholas IV valued St Chad 's at £ 68 13s 4d — the third richest church in Lancashire . In 1345 , repairs to the chancel were ordered in a letter from Simon de <unk> of Richmond to Sir William , the dean of Amounderness . 
 In 1415 , King Henry V dissolved the alien priories ( those under control of religious houses abroad ) and the church at Poulton reverted to the Crown . It was given by Henry to Syon Monastery in Middlesex . At the time of the English Reformation in the 16th century , St Chad 's became the Anglican parish church . Originally , the parish included Poulton , Carleton , Thornton , Hardhorn @-@ with @-@ Newton and Marton . The Syon Monastery was suppressed in 1539 during Henry VIII 's Dissolution of the Monasteries and St Chad 's again returned to the Crown 's possession . In the reign of Elizabeth I ( after a brief restoration of Syon by Mary I ) , the advowson was granted to John Fleetwood of Penwortham . The Fleetwood family remained the patrons of St Chad 's until the early 20th century . 
 Some time in the 17th century , the present tower was built , possibly during Charles I 's reign . In 1751 the church was extensively renovated . It was previously thought that the old church ( except the tower ) was completely demolished but recent evidence indicates that the " new " building still contains the outer walls of the previous structure . These original walls , of red sandstone , were faced with grey ashlar . The nave was rebuilt in 1753 with money from Richard Hesketh of Meols and his wife Margaret ( the daughter of Richard Fleetwood ) . 
 By the 19th century , the graveyard was full and had become a public health concern . It was overrun with rats , and dogs chasing the rats , both of which were damaging the churchyard . Finding sufficient ground for new burials was increasingly difficult and bones were often removed to a nearby charnel house . In 1849 , an extra charge was put on burials of people from outside the parish . In 1884 , the churchyard was closed to all burials and a cemetery was opened in the <unk> 
 A round Norman @-@ style apse was added to the church in 1868 , the architects being the Lancaster partnership of Paley and Austin . The incumbent , the Rev. Thomas Clarke , paid for this addition , but died before its construction was complete . Architect J. S. Crowther oversaw further alterations in 1881 – 83 ; a baptistery was built , the organ was moved and choir stalls were built in the chancel . Some work was done to the interior of the tower in 1908 . Renovations in 1955 included the addition of a central aisle and the removal of some of the church furnishings . The Victorian pulpit was replaced . A small extension was added north of the tower in 2005 . 
 The advowson to Poulton , which had been in the possession of the Fleetwood / Hesketh family for approximately 400 years , was sold in 1934 by Major Charles Fleetwood @-@ Hesketh to the Diocese of Blackburn .

 The outer walls of the church are constructed of red sandstone with grey ashlar dressings ; the roofs are slate . The church plan consists of a nave , with a square tower to the west and a chancel and apsidal sanctuary to the east . There is a clergy vestry at the south @-@ east corner of the building . 
 The tower at the west end of the church dates from the early 17th century . It sits next to the south @-@ west corner of the nave , aligned with the south wall , because the former church plan included a north aisle ; the north wall of the tower meets the nave at its roof ridge . It is castellated and constructed of coursed roughly @-@ dressed stone . It has two diagonal buttresses , two angled buttresses and four corner pinnacles . There are slate belfry louvres on each side of the tower and clock faces on the north and south sides . 
 A small stone porch towards the east end of the south wall leads to the Fleetwood family burial vault . The doorway is inscribed with " Insignia <unk> Fleetwood an hujus <unk> <unk> , Anno <unk> 1699 " <unk> There are two more doorways on the south side of the nave , both have been restored and have Tuscan columns , triglyphs and pediments . Above the doorways are oval windows , added in the 19th century which , according to Clare Hartwell , " add a touch of sophistication " . There are large round @-@ headed pairs of arched windows with Y @-@ tracery , ( possibly added later ) and plain architraves . There are three such windows on the north side and four on the south side with more round @-@ headed windows in the apse . 
 = = = Interior and fittings = = = 
 Internally , the nave measures 93 feet 6 inches ( 28 @.@ 50 m ) by 36 feet ( 11 m ) , the chancel ( including apse ) measures 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) by 17 feet 6 inches ( 5 @.@ 33 m ) and the tower measures 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) by 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) . The ceiling of the church has shallow ribbed vaulting . There are galleries to the north , west and south , accessed by a Georgian staircase in the north @-@ west that has turned balusters . The north and south galleries are supported by plain Tuscan columns and both contain box pews that date from 1752 . Stained glass dates from the late 19th century to the mid @-@ 20th century and includes work by Lancaster designers Shrigley and Hunt . The pulpit was constructed in 1955 in the Jacobean style from the four sides of a 17th @-@ century pulpit . It has arabesques and a portion of an inscription from the Book of Isaiah . 
 In the south @-@ west corner of the nave is a choir vestry , which was originally built as a baptistery . Its screen is made of carved oak , formed in 1883 from one part of the Fleetwood family box pew that was originally situated in the chancel where the choir stalls now sit . In 1883 , this pew had been described as " looking like a cross between a railway carriage and the centre piece of a gondola " . The wood is carved with emblems of the family including a double @-@ headed eagle , wheat sheaves and a griffin . The screen door comes from the box pew of another prominent local family — the <unk> of Layton . It has a carving of a goat 's head and is inscribed with " AR 1636 " . 
 Six hatchments hang in St Chad 's in memory of 18th century members of the Hesketh @-@ Fleetwood family . These hatchments are diamond @-@ shaped representations of individual coats of arms , painted for their funeral processions and then hung in the parish church . 
 There is a ring of eight bells hung in an iron frame in the tower ; they are rung from the ground floor of the tower . Five of the bells were cast in 1741 by Abel Rudhall of Gloucester . They were rehung in 1908 . The sixth bell was recast in 1865 by Mears and Co. of London . In 1919 , the church bells were still customarily rung to signal the town curfew between September and March . Two more bells were added in 1937 , cast by Mears and Stainbank .

 To the south of the church there are the remnants of a stone preaching cross . The cross was originally situated on Poulton 's boundary and marked a resting place for mourners travelling long distances to bury corpses at St Chad 's . Only the two circular steps into which the original structure was set remain ; the cross shaft has been replaced by an octagonal pillar . The pillar was used as a sundial until the early 20th century when the gnomon was stolen . The steps function as a memorial for present @-@ day mourners at St Chad 's , in a small garden of remembrance . The churchyard is noted locally for its display of crocuses and other flowering bulbs in early springtime . 
 Although the churchyard has been closed to burials since 1884 , the ashes of cremated bodies have been interred in a small area to the west of the church since the 1950s . The paths in the churchyard incorporate gravestones that were set horizontally in 1973 . There are few gravestones still standing , but there are several table tombs . To the south @-@ east of the church there is a gravestone marking the grave of Edward <unk> ( d . 1741 ) ; the stone features carvings of a skull and crossbones and an hourglass , and is known locally as the " pirate 's grave " .

 = Missing You ( The Saturdays song ) = 
 " Missing You " is a song performed by British @-@ Irish girl group The Saturdays , taken from their first EP , Headlines ! . Written by Alexander Kronlund and Lukas Hilbert with production from Hilbert and James Reynolds , the song was released as the collection 's lead single on 8 August 2010 as a digital download and on 9 August as a CD single . The lyrics centre on being in a relationship where the passion has died , but still being addicted to the love that used to exist . It features an electropop production , incorporating elements of synthpop . The group described the song as " an updated version of their sound " and was fun to record and experiment with . " Missing You is more out @-@ there than that rest of [ Headlines ! ] . " 
 The single received mostly negative reception from critics , who criticised the decision to release " Missing You " as a single , for using auto @-@ tuned vocals and the song 's production , which lacked energy . An accompanying music video features scenes of the group dancing on a beach in Málaga , Spain . It charted in Ireland at number six but in the UK it fared better , reaching number three , beaten by Flo Rida 's " Club Can 't Handle Me " featuring David Guetta and Eminem 's " Love The Way You Lie " featuring Rihanna . It was the second time that the group have lost out to Flo Rida in chart battle although it is their fourth top @-@ ten hit in Ireland and seventh in the UK .

 " Missing You " is an electropop song incorporating elements of trance and synthpop . It was written by Lukas Hilbert and Alexander Kronlund . According to the group " it 's about being in a relationship where the passion has gone – so you 're missing that spark . It 's quite deep , actually , for a pop song . " The critics also agreed , calling the lyrics " surprisingly dark " . It has also been described as " experimental " and an " updated version " of their previous sound . The production was described as " pretty " but " limp " as the " melody is traded for a random ' miss , missing you ' refrain " . Some of the group also make use of Auto @-@ Tune on their vocals , mainly Frankie Sandford , whilst Mollie King uses the natural croak in her voice and Vanessa White 's vocals had a nasal tone .

" Tony Falls of Virgin Media was also highly critical of the song awarding it zero out of ten . " Never have a group got by with so little a contribution to music , but so big a contribution to rolling back feminist progress . ' Missing You ' sounds like an album track . Not something you ’ d hear as a comeback track that would uplift your lost consciousness about the girls ’ disappearance . The idea of shooting the video in Spain for this type of song is a nice choice , but Frankie is overly tanned . Please kill me . A vacuous set of reviews for a vacuous group of girls . " 
 However Fraser McAlpine gave the song a mixed review , awarding it three out of five stars . He pointed out that fans of the group would be divided on the song . " Something hidden deep in the song 's DNA is engagingly bad , or worryingly good , and it 's got everyone 's quality alarms jangling like a wind @-@ chime in a hurricane ...

 = Illawarra Steam Navigation Company = 
 The Illawarra Steam Navigation Company was a shipping company that serviced the south coast of New South Wales , Australia from 1858 to the early 1950s . It was formed through the amalgamation of the General Steam Navigation Company , the Kiama Steam Navigation Company and the Shoalhaven Steam Navigation Company , each of whom serviced parts of the south coast with their respective vessels . After merging , the new company held a near monopoly in regard to shipping on the south coast , and their fleet visited every significant port between Sydney and the border of Victoria . The company transported both passengers and a range of produce , including livestock , and hence it became known as the ' Pig and Whistle Line ' : it was said that ships would wait an hour for a pig but not a minute for a passenger . 
 Over the years more than twenty steamships were a part of the fleet , including the 1112 ton Merimbula and the 693 ton Eden . Many of these vessels were purpose @-@ built for the company 's needs , and were constructed at shipyards both within Australia and abroad . The company 's eventual demise came as a result of a number of factors , including increased competition from road and rail , the cost of replacing ships after World War II , waterfront disputes and rising costs . As a consequence , after almost 100 years in operation , the company was placed into voluntary receivership and was delisted from the stock exchange in 1955 . 
 = = History = = 
 Prior to the formation of the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company in 1858 , a number of companies and individuals ran steamships along the south coast of New South Wales . The first of these was the Sophia Jane , which had traveled to Australia under her own power from the United Kingdom ( and was the first steamship to do so ) , arriving in Sydney in 1831 . But while the Sophia Jane ran a service to Wollongong , a more regular service was provided from 1839 with the establishment of the Illawarra Steam Packet Company . The Illawarra Steam Packet Company was not known by that name for long , as just three months after being established , the company merged with the Brisbane Water Steam Passenger Co. to become the General Steam Navigation Company . The newly formed company initially employed two steam vessels , the Maitland and the William IV , both of which were built in New South Wales on the Williams River , and the company serviced the Hunter River along with the south coast . 
 The General Steam Navigation Company continued to expand , services to Jervis Bay and Kiama were trialled ( and later abandoned ) , and the company launched the Illawarra to handle the run to Wollongong . Nevertheless , competition soon emerged . This included the screw @-@ driven steamship <unk> , which began operations in 1852 between Sydney and Wollongong , although she failed to achieve commercial success and was sold to " Victorian interests " . Other competition emerged as a direct result of the lack of service provided to ports further south of Wollongong . Residents at two of those towns – Kiama and Shoalhaven – were led to form two new steamship companies in 1854 . These new companies , the Kiama Steam Navigation Company and the Shoalhaven Steam Navigation Company respectively ran the steamships Kiama and Nora Creina . 
 At this point three steamship companies were handling the south coast , and this proved to be too much competition for their respective interests . Thus in 1855 an agreement was reached , leaving the south coast to just the Illawarra , Kiama and Nora Creina . However , an enquiry had been undertaken into the transport facilities in the Bega district in 1851 , in October 1858 the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company through an act of the New South Wales Parliament became an amalgam of the three companies . The new amalgamated company possessed a fleet of at least three vessels : the Illawarra , Kiama and Nora Creina that had been servicing the region . To this list the Nowra was added , while a sixth – the Mimosa – was soon included on the register . 
 The number of ships continued to grow , and by 1866 the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company was running weekly services from south coast ports to Sydney , carrying wool , cedar , coal and a variety of raw materials . As the company expanded it became known as the " Pig & Whistle " run , due to the main cargo and the " whistle " that was made by the ships prior to departing from the port . The company was to play a leading role in the development of coastal New South Wales , and her ships were to stop at every port between Sydney and the Victorian border . As such , by 1905 , the company was able to link Eden by regular steam communication with Sydney , Launceston , Tasmania , Hobart and New Zealand . The company enjoyed a near – monopoly on the south coast trade for many years , negotiating with or taking over many potential competitors , although competition from rail and road transport were to play a significant role in the eventual demise of the company . 
 Along with cargo the company also took passengers , and an article by Henry Lawson , published in The Bulletin in 1910 and titled ' Bermagui - In a Strange Sunset ' , describes a steamer journey from Bermagui to Sydney – in all likelihood Lawson was traveling with the company . Unfortunately , in 1928 one of the company 's vessels , the Merimbula , ran ashore on Beecroft Head while heading south . After this wreck , passenger shipping to the south coast finished , and the company focused entirely upon cargo . 
 In 1904 the company was incorporated as the Illawarra and South Coast Steam Navigation Company ( <unk> ) , and the company continued to operate successfully until the Second World War . However , significant problems had emerged for the company , even though it remained in good financial standing . In particular , road transport was able to offer a door @-@ to @-@ door service , ( although the company did attempt to provide something similar at Narooma ) , and the railways provided increased competition , entering into exclusive contracts with some hotels and taking some goods contracts away from the shipping line . When combined with waterfront disputes , rising costs , and the post @-@ war costs of ship replacement , the company was in trouble , and in 1948 , for the first time , no dividend was paid to investors . In 1950 the company entered into voluntary liquidation , and this led to delisting from the Australian Stock Exchange in 1955 . 
 = = Ports = = 
 In the early 1850s , when the General Steam Navigation Company , Kiama Steam Navigation Company and the Shoalhaven Steam Navigation Company were independent operations , the major ports of call along the south coast of New South Wales included Sydney , Wollongong , Shoalhaven , Merimbula , Kiama and Twofold Bay . After the amalgamation of the three companies , this list included stops at <unk> , Batemans Bay , and <unk> . Later , minor gold rushes at both Moruya and the <unk> district resulted in their inclusion , and other ports were to include Bermagui , Eden , Narooma and Tathra . 
 The extent of the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company 's operations along the coast can be seen by their 1870 schedule , in which they were making the journey to Kiama , Shoalhaven and <unk> every three days , and to Ulladulla , Clyde , Shoalhaven and Wollongong at about the same rate . <unk> was visited every two weeks , while an additional journey was made to Merimbula and Ulladulla once a week . 1873 saw a simplification of these services , and a weekly run to Merimbula , Eden and Tathra was amongst the changes . 
 Maintaining the services of the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company did , at times , take some effort on the part of the residents . For example , in Ulladulla a wooden jetty was built in 1859 in order to retain the services of the company ; they had informed the farmers that their ships would not call again at Ulladulla unless better mooring facilities were provided . ( After seven years the jetty was replaced by a stone pier built by the government on the natural reef ) . Similarly the town of Tathra was created through the erection of a small jetty , built so that the local farmers could gain access to coastal shipping which previously had stopped 25 km away at Merimbula . 
 = = Ships = = 
 <unk> together the Illawarra Steamship Navigation Company 's fleet is difficult , as , unlike most steamship companies of the day , neither the company 's advertising nor their arrival and departure notices carried the names of the vessels . Instead they simply listed the ships as " <unk> Steamers " , if the vessels were mentioned at all . Nevertheless , it is known that when the company was amalgamated they had at least three vessels to handle the south coast trade : the Kiama from the Kiama Steamship Company , the Nora Creina from the Shoalhaven Steam Navigation Company , and the General Steamship Company 's Illawarra . 
 Of these three , the Kiama was a 104 @-@ ton paddle steamer that entered service with the company in 1855 . Purpose @-@ built in Glasgow in 1854 , she took 144 days to arrive in Australia , and she served the South Coast until 1876 when she was sold and converted into a hulk . Prior to sale she had been lengthened from her original 123 feet to 154 feet , and her tonnage increased to 111 tons . The Nora Creina , on the other hand , was lighter at 93 tons , and was locally built in Sydney . She was sold by the company in 1861 . The third of the original three vessels , Illawarra , had been constructed at Waterford in 1849 with a net weight of 166 tons , but , like the Nora Creina , she was only to remain with the new company until 1861 when she was sold . 
 By 1864 the company was operating a fleet of at least four ships - the Kiama was still in service , and she had been joined by Hunter , Mynora and Kembla . Both Kembla , a 204 @-@ ton iron steamship , and Hunter , a paddle steamer with a net weight of 105 tons , were built in Glasgow , Scotland . The Mynora was built in Australia at <unk> in Sydney . A 117 @-@ ton wooden paddle steamer , her time with the company ended in 1864 after she ran into St Georges Head in Wreck Bay . In an attempt to save the lives of passengers and crew , the captain fought to keep the ship afloat until she finally ran aground on a sandy beach approximately three miles from the headland . While the boat was lost , all of the passengers and crew on Mynora were saved . 
 The next significant change to the company 's fleet came in 1878 with the purchase of the Illawarra ( II ) . At 533 tons and 190 feet in length , she handled both passengers and cargo for the company , and proved to be " most popular " until being laid up in 1908 and eventually scrapped . Illawarra ( II ) was soon joined by Allowrie , a 504 @-@ ton vessel built in 1880 for carrying passengers and cargo , including livestock and dairy produce . ( Allowrie remained in service with the Illawarra Steam Navigation Company until 1909 , when , like Illawarra ( II ) , she was laid up ) . The third major vessel during this period was <unk> . A 515 @-@ ton steamer , she was built in 1880 , but was then lost when wrecked on Pedro Reef off Moruya in October , 1897 . 
 When the company was reconstituted as the Illawarra and South Coast Steam Navigation Company in 1904 , their vessels included Allowrie and two new steamers : Eden and Bega . Eden was a 693 @-@ ton screw steamer that had arrived in 1900 , a purpose @-@ built vessel constructed for the company in Glasgow to handle the Sydney – Merimbula – Eden – Tathra route . Eden remained with the company until being converted to a hulk , and she was finally scuttled in 1933 . Bega , at 567 tons , transported both passengers and cargo between 1883 when she was launched and 1907 when she capsized with the loss of one of the passengers . 
 At least two more ships joined the fleet in the early 1900s : Peterborough , which was acquired from the <unk> Steam Navigation Company , and Merimbula . At the time Merimbula was the company 's finest vessel . She was a 1122 @-@ ton screw steamer which provided accommodation for 106 passengers ( 96 saloon and 10 second class ) as well as possessing refrigerated cargo space , and she was capable of between 13 and 14 knots . Unfortunately she ran aground off Beecroft Head in 1928 . 
 Just prior to the onset of the first World War , four new ships were purchased : Bermagui , <unk> , <unk> and <unk> . <unk> was requisitioned for the war effort and repurposed as a minesweeper , and she was lost in 1924 . After the war the company purchased another three vessels : <unk> , <unk> and Kianga . Two of these three boats , <unk> and Kianga , were requisitioned during World War II , but while both survived the hostilities , Kianga was not returned to the company after being decommissioned . 
 = Bacon ice cream = 
 Bacon ice cream ( or bacon @-@ and @-@ egg ice cream ) is a modern invention , generally created by adding bacon to egg custard and freezing the mixture . The concept of bacon ice cream originated in a 1973 sketch on the British comedy series The Two Ronnies as a joke ; however , it was eventually created for April Fools ' Day . Heston Blumenthal experimented with the creation of ice cream , making a custard similar to scrambled eggs then adding bacon to create one of his signature dishes . It now appears on dessert menus in other restaurants . 
 = = Origins = = 
 Ice cream is generally expected to be a sweet food , eaten at dessert , even though there is evidence of savoury ice creams being created in Victorian times . Bacon ice cream originated as a joke , a flavour that no one would willingly eat , in the 1973 " Ice Cream Parlour Sketch " by The Two Ronnies , where a customer requests cheese and onion flavoured ice cream followed by smokey bacon . 
 Bacon and egg ice cream was eventually created as an April Fools ' Day experiment at Aldrich 's Beef and Ice Cream Parlor in Fredonia , New York . In 1982 , co @-@ owner Scott Aldrich was challenged by a gravy salesman to make gravy ice cream , which he did for April Fools ' Day that year . Although it was reportedly " their most disgusting " creation , Aldrich 's went on to release other shocking flavours on April Fools ' Day , such as " chocolate spaghetti ice cream " ( Julia Aldrich 's first of many contributions ) , " ketchup and mustard swirl " , " Pork and beans " or " sauerkraut and vanilla " in 1991 . In 1992 , they made 15 US gallons ( 57 l ; 12 imp gal ) of bacon and egg ice cream which he gave away free to anyone who would try it . Despite their names , the ice creams generally received positive reviews . 
 In 2003 an ice cream parlour , " <unk> Delight " , opened in Rehoboth Beach , Delaware , specialising in " outlandish " ice cream flavours . Amongst other flavours , such as their award @-@ winning peanut butter and jelly ice cream , they have created a bacon ice cream which tastes like butter pecan – implying that the ice cream was a butter pecan with candied bacon . The owner , Chip Hearn , had included the flavour along with 17 others in an invitation @-@ only focus group , where the tasters were allowed to suggest changes and give opinions on the flavour . 
 = = Recipes = = 
 As bacon ice cream was first created in 1992 and only came to the forefront in the 2000s , there is no traditional recipe . Recipes generally involve adding bacon to a standard sweet ice cream recipe , often vanilla but other suggestions include coffee , rum or pecan . The saltiness of the bacon will then highlight the sweet flavour of the rest of the ice cream . According to one Wired.com article , the bacon should be candied prior to addition , a process which involves baking the bacon in a sugar syrup . This has the benefit of sweetening the bacon , in a similar manner to pancakes in some parts of the United States . 
 = = = Heston Blumenthal variation = = = 
 Heston Blumenthal 's recipe uses ice cream without flavouring , but that tastes of egg . In his book The Big Fat Duck Cookbook , his recipe is broken down into five constituent parts including the ice cream , caramelised French toast , a tomato <unk> , a thin slice of <unk> hardened with maple syrup and a tea jelly . Considerable time is taken for the creation of the ice cream : the bacon is lightly roasted with the fat on , then infused in milk for 10 hours . This infused mix is precisely heated with egg and sugar to over @-@ cook the eggs – increasing the eggy flavour . The resulting mixture is sieved , put through a food processor , churned and frozen . Blumenthal has since updated his recipe , to include an additional ten @-@ hour period of soaking the bacon in a vacuum @-@ packed bag prior to baking . He has also changed the presentation so that the unfrozen ice cream is injected into empty egg shells , and then dramatically scrambled at the customer 's table in liquid nitrogen , giving the impression of cooking . 
 = = Heston Blumenthal = = 
 Heston Blumenthal , a chef who owns The Fat Duck in Bray , Berkshire and is famous for creating unusual dishes by following the principles of molecular gastronomy . Using these principles the restaurant has won three Michelin stars among other achievements . As early as 2001 , he was using the principle of " flavour encapsulation " to create savoury ice cream flavours such as mustard grain and crab . Blumenthal , in an article explaining the concept of " flavour encapsulation " , explained that flavour is much more intense in encapsulated bursts , rather than being dispersed in a solution , stating that the more that the eggs are cooked , the more that the proteins stick together . This creates pockets of egg flavour in the ice cream , which release as it melts in customers ' mouths . 
 " [ Blumenthal 's ] bacon and egg ice cream came about through his interest in ' flavour encapsulation ' : the principle of which means a single coffee bean crushed in your teeth while drinking hot water will taste much more of coffee than the same crushed bean dissolved in the water . One day , using that principle , he over @-@ cooked the egg custard for an ice cream , so that it practically became scrambled . He puréed that and made an ice cream from it , that had an immense eggy flavour ... [ which ] was not particularly pleasant . Which was when he decided to see if he could incorporate the sweet tones of smoked bacon into an egg ice cream . Boy , did it work . " 
 Blumenthal explains that traditional ice cream is frozen egg custard with flavours added . Using his method to create ice cream , he whisks egg yolks with sugar until the sugar interacts with the proteins in the yolk , creating a network of proteins . The entire substance turns white , at which point any flavouring can be added and cooked in . While stirring the mixture , Blumenthal cools it as fast as possible using liquid nitrogen . 
 Blumenthal 's bacon and egg ice cream , now one of his signature dishes , along with his other unique flavours , has given him a reputation as ' The Wizard of Odd ' and has made his restaurant a magnet for food enthusiasts . In the 2006 New Years Honours List , Blumenthal was awarded Officer of the Most Excellent Order of the British Empire ( OBE ) , the United Kingdom 's fourth highest order of chivalry , for his services to food . Blumenthal has stated that one ambition is to create an ice cream with flavours released in time @-@ separated stages , for example bacon and egg followed by orange juice or tea . Once he perfects the technique of separating the flavours , he would attempt mussels followed by chocolate . 
 = = Reception = = 
 Bacon ice cream has received a mixed reception ; as a combination of sweet and savoury flavours , it was designed to be controversial . In 2004 , rival chef Nico Ladenis showed his disapproval for the Michelin Star system by suggesting that bacon ice cream shows such a desperate need for originality in very graphic language . Blumenthal pointed out that Ladenis had never actually tried the aforementioned ice cream . 
 Trevor White has suggested that the Heston Blumenthal has latched onto a culture where we cannot get enough of the new and are spoiled by choice , comparing the food to a " freak @-@ show " . Janet Street @-@ Porter is highly critical of Blumenthal 's cooking philosophy , explaining that it was pretentious . She attempted to make his egg @-@ and @-@ bacon ice cream from the recipe published in his book , The Big Fat Duck Cookbook , altering the recipe slightly due to her hectic workload and guessing when she did not have the right tools . The end result she described as nauseating and " too sickly for words " . 
 The ice cream also sparked debate within the Los Angeles Times , where the food writer Noelle Carter described bacon ice cream as perfection but the health section put up a photograph of a heart bypass and the headline " Bacon ice cream . No good can come of it " . The Delaware " <unk> Delight " ice cream maker , Chip Hearn , who made bacon ice cream appears to have done so partly as a gimmick to get people into his shop , since he allows customers to taste any flavour in the store . He explains that his flavours differentiate him from the many other parlours on the shore and many people come in to try bacon ice cream only to buy something else . 
 A re @-@ creation by a chef @-@ in @-@ training has been highlighted in the webcomic Three Panel Soul 's 2008 post called " On Surprises . " The recipe was posted to their forums , and saved on other sites like the entry for it on OK Cupid .

 Bacon ice cream has been re @-@ created by other chefs in recent years . For example , it appears on the menu at <unk> Sucre in Barcelona , a restaurant that specialises in desserts , with descriptions such as " innovative " and " spectacular " . In the United States , bacon was one of the themes for dessert at the Fancy food show . In 2006 , two separate contestants created versions of bacon ice cream in the reality series Top Chef . Celebrity chef Bob Blumer won a Texas ice cream making competition with a bacon ice cream . Originally planning to use candied bacon , he changed at the last moment to do a bacon brittle ice cream . Chef Michael Symon made bacon ice cream in the first season of the Food Network 's The Next Iron Chef competition . Andrew Knowlton , a judge , dismissed it as not original . But Symon managed to progress in the competition and eventually win .

 = Vanitas : Flesh Dress for an Albino <unk> = 
 " Vanitas : Flesh Dress for an Albino <unk> " ( 1987 ) is an artwork created by Canadian Jana Sterbak , first displayed at Montreal 's Galerie Rene <unk> . Its most famous showing was at the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa , where it attracted national controversy . The work was composed of 50 pounds of raw flank steaks sewn together , and hung on a hanger . According to the artist , the work is a contrast between vanity and bodily decomposition . The artwork is in the collections of Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and of Centre Pompidou in Paris ( edition of 2 + artist copy ) . 
 = = Description = = 
 The artwork consists of a " Flesh Dress " , constructed of slabs of beef sewn together , hung on a tailor 's dummy . On a nearby wall is a framed photograph of a model posing in the dress . The dress is stitch together from 50 @-@ 60 pounds of raw flank steak and must be constructed anew each time it is shown . The work included either $ 260 or $ 300 worth of meat , as of its 1991 showing . 
 As suggested by the title , the work is considered within the genre of " vanitas " , a category of art showing death and decay . The work includes non @-@ traditional materials , a trend in 20th @-@ century art . It " stands in the Surrealist tradition of the uncanny , of the <unk> , disturbing the distinctions , by which we categorize experience " . 
 There were some earlier instances of meat being used as clothing in art . Seafood outfits , including a lobster bikini , were featured at Salvador Dalí 's The Dream of Venus pavilion at the 1939 World 's Fair . The cover of the November 1983 The Undertones compilation album , All Wrapped Up showed a female model wearing cuts of meat held in place with plastic wrap . The clothes are mostly bacon , with a sausage necklace . In 2010 , singer Lady Gaga attended an awards show wearing a meat dress similar to Sterbak 's in style . 
 = = Exhibition = = 
 Montreal gallery Galerie Rene <unk> exhibited the " Flesh Dress " in 1987 . The exhibit received " scant " attention . 
 At age 36 , Sterbak was given a retrospective show at the National Gallery of Canada called " States of Being " , reviewing the past decade of her works . Scheduled from 8 March to 21 May 1991 , the exhibit included works like " Cone on Hand " ( 1979 ) . The exhibit was relatively well @-@ attended , compared to other shows , due in part to the controversy , and was discussed in the catalog Jana Sterbak : States of Being = corps à corps . 
 When the meat was shriveling , flaking , and falling off , one anonymous donor gave the gallery $ 260 for replacement meat . ( This number was of some debate , with $ 350 worth of meat listed in one vegetarian magazine . ) Because of the negative publicity the work had received , gallery staff pretended to be caterers when finding a butcher in the Ottawa area to provide replacement meat . 
 In 1993 , the T. B. Walker Acquisition Fund purchased a copy of the work for the Walker Art Center , in Minnesota . It was reconstructed by a small team in 2011 , for the show " Midnight Party " . 
 The work later was exhibited at the Tate Modern in London , for the exhibition " Rites of Passage " . When the small retrospective of her work was taken to Antoni <unk> Foundation in Barcelona , the show was " edited down to an arid minimum " by the artist herself , which included editing out the dress . In 2011 , the work was presented at " Tous <unk> " at la Maison Rouge [ 1 ] and in 2010 at Elles @ Centre Pompidou , Paris Jana Sterbak / Couture sanglante . 
 = = Controversy = = 
 The work was one in a series of controversies surrounding the National Gallery of Canada in the 1980s and 1990s , including the acquisition of Barnett Newman 's " Voice of Fire " ( 1967 ) , less than a year before . The show drew criticism from Members of Parliament , and the organizers of food banks and soup kitchens . It was considered an insult , given the early 1990s recession . 
 Progressive Conservative MP Felix Holtmann , a pig farmer from Manitoba commented : " I call it a jerky dress . There are a lot of people who hold food sacred in this land , and they are appalled by the use of food for this thing . " In response , one newspaper editorial called him a " meat head " . Holtmann was chair of the House of Commons Communications and Culture Committee , which oversees the NGC funding ; the committee itself was split on the issue . The artist called Holtmann a " self @-@ proclaimed Philistine [ who is ] not even successful as a hog farmer . " Art critic Christopher Hume commented that the Committee 's concept " was based on the notion that the National Gallery is somehow accountable for poverty and hunger in Canada . Surely the irony of their desperate position is that they are members of the group that created the mess the country is now in . " 
 Ottawa alderman Mark Maloney called health inspectors , who found that there the work presented no health hazards . <unk> on 1 April , Dr. Edward Ellis of the Ottawa @-@ Carlton Health Department issued a statement that the dress presented " no health hazard to the public at this time " , so long as no one touches or eats it . The inspector also suggested the dress was out of their jurisdiction , being on a federal property ; the department asked Health and Welfare Canada to follow up . 
 The Toronto Sun and sister paper Ottawa Sun printed a cartoon featuring " a curvy , spaghetti @-@ strapped slip " made of the same materials as the meat dress . The editorial cartoon suggested readers cut out the image , smear it with foodstuffs , and mail it to [ show curator Diana ] Nemiroff ; her address was included with the image . A writer for Canadian Art noted how the cartoonist suggested respondents use the most repulsive material possible , as " Diana will like that , " was an emphasis of the curator 's gender , with subtly sexual suggestions . The mailroom opened mail with gloves for weeks after the cartoon ; one was covered in feces . A sexually @-@ threatening letter was sent to the NGC communications officer , who had been quoted in articles about the work . The writer for Canadian Art suggested reaction would have been different if the genders of the artist and curator were different , that the work would have likely been deemed sexist , for starters . In all , 200 people mailed food scraps to the National Gallery of Canada within a week . 
 Contemporary Canadian art curator Diana Nemiroff suggested the controversy was largely due to the work being taken out of the larger context of the show . " There 's no doubt that the dress is a provocative object and it 's meant to be a provocative object , but the cry that it 's a waste of food is misplaced . " She noted that other exhibits have used grains , breads , and potatoes were used as part of previous exhibits , but the flesh was likely source of the controversy . Said Nemiroff : " It 's kind of double cross because clothing is supposed to be second skin and cover us up . And this one reverses the process and reveals what we don 't want to confront : our mortality . " 
 The film The Silence of the Lambs , about a man who butchers women , was released around the same time , a coincidence noted by a writer for Canadian Art magazine . 
 In various critical reviews , the work of German Joseph Beuys was referenced ; a 1996 work by Sterbak portrayed her as a moth , eating up the clothes in his closet . New York Times writer Ann Wilson Lloyd noted in 1998 that Sterbak 's work " has inspired reams of humorless , abstruse theoretical writing that leaves none of her layered metaphors unturned . Yet Ms. Sterbak 's work – seductive , intensely physical and edged with dark absurdity – delivers a mind @-@ body frisson unknowable by intellect alone . " 
 = The Last of Us : American Dreams = 
 The Last of Us : American Dreams is a four @-@ issue comic book series based on the video game The Last of Us . The series was written by Neil Druckmann and Faith Erin Hicks , with illustrations by Hicks and coloring by Rachelle Rosenberg . The series was published by Dark Horse Comics between April and July 2013 , and a collected edition was published in October 2013 . 
 Like the game , the comic is set in a post @-@ apocalyptic world , overrun by zombie @-@ like creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus . The comics serve as a prequel to the game , chronicling the journey of the young Ellie and her meeting with another young survivor , Riley Abel . Druckmann chose Ellie as the focus of the comic due to the uniqueness of her birth and upbringing in the post @-@ apocalyptic world . Hicks joined the project after discovering Ellie 's role in the game , considering her an unusual character to include in a survival horror game . The comic 's art style is different than the game art — a choice from Hicks to give the comic a unique feel and identity . 
 The series received generally positive reviews . Critics particularly praised Druckmann 's writing and character development , as well as the simplicity of Hicks ' illustrations . The series was also a commercial success , with some issues requiring reprinting due to high demand . 
 = = Publication history = = 
 Dark Horse Comics approached creative director Neil Druckmann , who was working on The Last of Us , to produce a tie @-@ in comic book series for the game . Druckmann was initially wary of the idea , but eventually agreed when he realized Dark Horse " didn 't want to do something tangential " with the opportunity of expanding their characters and universe beyond the game . Work on the comic began during the game 's development , which allowed the stories of the two projects to integrate , and influence each other . Druckmann requested webcomic artist Faith Erin Hicks as a collaborator on the project , after reading her comic Friends with Boys ( 2012 ) and appreciating " how personal it felt " . He also felt that Hicks could capture the " gritty " feel of the game . Hicks then sent some concept art to Dark Horse as a pitch for the job ; they accepted , and she became officially involved with the project . Hicks was drawn to the project after reading about the character of Ellie in the game 's script ; she considered Ellie an unusual character to include in a survival horror game , calling her a " tough teenage girl who wasn 't sexualized , and who seemed very much the equal of her male counterpart " . Hicks was given access to various gameplay sequences and the game 's script during development , to allow her to better understand the story . She was also given videos of the actors performing on set , which was helpful when illustrating the characters . " I get a look at these characters and I see them interacting as human beings , not just as concept art , " said Hicks . 
 Ellie 's back story was originally intended to fit as a gameplay sequence within The Last of Us , but this was ultimately scrapped . When Dark Horse approached Naughty Dog with the idea of a comic book , Druckmann had the opportunity to tell the story . Druckmann found that Ellie was the ideal main character for the comic due to her birth and upbringing ; while characters like Joel mostly lived in the world before the outbreak , Ellie is unaware of life prior to the outbreak . This created an interesting idea for Druckmann , who became intrigued with discovering the effects of everyday actions in a post @-@ apocalyptic world . Hicks enjoyed writing American Dreams , particularly due to the humor featured in the comic . Druckmann allowed Hicks to design the character of Riley , including her physical appearance , characteristics , and most of her dialogue . " It felt like a good way to split it , where [ Hicks ] would own Riley and I would own Ellie , " said Druckmann . When creating the comic 's art style , Hicks avoided replicating the game art , instead opting to " draw it in [ her ] own style and to the best of [ her ] ability " . She felt that the art style is slightly " cartoony " , which is partially due to Ellie 's young age . " If [ the comic ] was hyper @-@ realistic and super @-@ rendered , I think it would undermine the story we 're trying to tell " , said Hicks . When designing the character Angel Knives for the comic 's second issue , Hicks was inspired by the style of the characters from the Mortal Kombat series . 
 The first issue of the comic was published on April 3 , 2013 , and a reprint became available on May 29 ; the second issue was also published on May 29 , followed by the third issue on June 26 , and the fourth issue on July 31 . All four issues were republished in a collected edition as a single package on October 30 , 2013 .

Riley Abel steps in to break up the fight , beating one of the boys and making the others flee . Ellie becomes angered by this , claiming that she can take care of herself . Riley then advises Ellie to flee , but the latter is caught and assigned to cleaning duty . While she is completing the chore , she realizes that Riley stole her Walkman , and later demands that she return it , which Riley reluctantly does . 
 At night , Ellie catches Riley attempting to sneak out of the school , and demands to accompany her . Riley reluctantly agrees , and the two make their way to the mall , where they meet Riley 's friend Winston . As Winston teaches Ellie how to ride a horse , Riley steals his radio , and discovers that an attack by the Fireflies — a rebel group opposing the quarantine zone authorities — has occurred nearby . Ellie and Riley make their way to the attack , and find that the Fireflies are wounded and outnumbered . To help , Ellie and Riley throw smoke grenades at the military , allowing the Fireflies to retreat safely . They are spotted by the military , and escape into a nearby alley , where they narrowly avoid being bitten by an Infected — zombie @-@ like creatures infected by a mutated strain of the Cordyceps fungus . 
 The girls are soon captured by Fireflies , who restrain them ; Marlene , the leader of the Fireflies , recognizes Ellie , and demands that she remains safe . When Riley claims she would like to join their group , Marlene refuses , and the two argue , resulting in Marlene threatening to shoot Riley . Ellie intervenes , demanding at gunpoint that Marlene explain how she knows information about Ellie . When Ellie finally lowers the gun , Marlene informs her that she knew Ellie 's mother , and had promised her that she would take care of Ellie . Ellie hands the gun to Marlene , who says that she would tell her more about her mother in the future , before telling the girls to leave . When Ellie and Riley reenter the quarantine zone , Riley says that there is no escape . Ellie suggests running away , but Riley informs her that this will just result in death . The two then walk back into the school .

 The Last of Us : American Dreams received generally positive reviews . Praise was particularly directed at the story and artwork of the comic , which were said to compliment each other . The comic was also a commercial success ; the first issue sold out , and the resulting high demand led to Dark Horse reissuing the installment . 
 The comic 's story received positive reactions . Lonnie Nadler of Bloody Disgusting felt unsure about the story in the first two issues due to their dedication to character development , but praised the final issue for delivering " authentic drama and raw intensity " which was missing from previous issues . IGN 's Jesse Schedeen felt that the story served to enhance the world and characters , and later praised the comic 's availability to readers who had not played the game . Conversely , Nathan Butler of Invisible Gamer felt that the introduction and development of the first two issues could have been shortened , and that the final issue attempted to include too much content , ultimately calling the comic a " sub @-@ par attempt at a video game tie @-@ in series " . 
 Reviewers also praised the comic 's artwork . Alasdair Stuart of SciFiNow wrote that the art was " so expressive and relaxed " , naming Hicks " one of the best artists of her generation " . Jen Bosier of Forbes felt that the art style worked well within the context of the story , and IGN 's Schedeen felt that the comic heavily relied on the artwork , and that its art style gave it a unique " style and identity " . Nadler of Bloody Disgusting called it " quite simplistic , but very clean " , and " visually expressive when it matters " , comparing it to Scott Pilgrim . Nadler also praised the choice of color , stating that it contained " the right palette of dark and <unk> hues " , as well as the cover artwork , calling it " consistently stunning " . Jennifer Cheng of Comic Book Resources also wrote that the colors fit with the setting of the comic . Peter <unk> of Geeks of Doom particularly praised Hicks ' depiction of the Infected as " in pain and desperate " , calling this " especially harrowing " .

In a September 2008 interview with Rap @-@ Up about a recent crop of songwriters becoming singers , Ne @-@ Yo said " For one , I think Keri Hilson ’ s too freakin ’ pretty to be in the background . For two , her voice is incredible — on top of the fact that she can write . So I think that she ’ s definitely one that deserves the spotlight .

 = = Composition = = 
 " Knock You Down " is a R & B song with a length of five minutes and twenty six seconds . The song also includes electro tones , and derives from pop and hip hop genres . The song is set in common time , and composed in a " moderate R & B groove . " It is written in the key of G minor , and vocals span from F3 to D5 . It follows the chord progression E ♭ – F – B ♭ – E ♭ – F – Gm . The song begins with a rap intro by Kanye West , accompanied by a " stabbing synth riff . " According to Chris Williams of Billboard , The verses contain a " thumping bass @-@ beat " while the chorus is in a " frenetic midtempo groove . " Dan Nishimoto of Prefix Magazine said the song had a " 4 / 4 Motown feel on the verses and stuttering drums on the chorus . " Hilson performs the first verse and chorus , while Ne @-@ Yo sings the second verse . West then has a rap interlude before Hilson sings an additional part before the song ends with the chorus by Hilson , accompanied by Ne @-@ Yo .

 Chris Williams of Billboard said " with a vocal assist from Ne @-@ Yo and a clever guest rap by Kanye West , it appears Hilson is intent on a knockout punch of her own . " Dan Nishimoto of Prefix Magazine said the song was one of the better radio @-@ friendly tracks on the album . Melinda Newman of HitFix said that " the mid @-@ tempo track is undeniably catchy and will embed itself within your brain after only a few listens . " Sophie Bruce of BBC Music positively received the song , calling it the album 's " biggest potential hit . " Although Nick Levine of Digital Spy gave the song three out of five stars , complimenting production by Danja , and saying that the song sounded like a more obvious hit than " Return the Favor " , he complained that " getting two R & B A @-@ listers to appear on your track should be a real coup , but not when one 's got a more distinctive voice than you and the other steals the show with some typically ballsy rapping . " Quentin B. Huff of PopMatters criticized the repetitive hook , stating " Hook @-@ wise , it ’ s a little like listening to an album of kids chanting while playing double @-@ dutch . " He also said that Hilson 's vocals " show promise but fail to distinguish the Hilson brand from the crowd . "

 = Major thirds tuning = 
 Among alternative tunings for guitar , a major @-@ thirds tuning is a regular tuning in which each interval between successive open strings is a major third ( " M3 " in musical abbreviation ) . Other names for major @-@ thirds tuning include major @-@ third tuning , M3 tuning , all @-@ thirds tuning , and augmented tuning . By definition , a major @-@ third interval separates two notes that differ by exactly four semitones ( one @-@ third of the twelve @-@ note octave ) . 
 The Spanish guitar 's tuning mixes four perfect fourths ( five semitones ) and one major @-@ third , the latter occurring between the G and B strings : 
 E @-@ A @-@ D @-@ G @-@ B @-@ E. 
 This tuning , which is used for acoustic and electric guitars , is called " standard " in English , a convention that is followed in this article . While standard tuning is irregular , mixing four fourths and one major third , M3 tunings are regular : Only major @-@ third intervals occur between the successive strings of the M3 tunings , for example , the open augmented C tuning 
 G ♯ -C @-@ E @-@ G ♯ -C @-@ E. 
 For each M3 tuning , the open strings form an augmented triad in two octaves . 
 For guitars with six strings , every major @-@ third tuning repeats its three open @-@ notes in two octaves , so providing many options for fingering chords . By repeating open @-@ string notes and by having uniform intervals between strings , major @-@ thirds tuning simplifies learning by beginners . These features also facilitate advanced guitarists ' improvisation , precisely the aim of jazz guitarist Ralph Patt when he began popularizing major @-@ thirds tuning between 1963 and 1964 . 
 = = Avoiding standard tuning 's irregular intervals = = 
 In standard tuning , the successive open @-@ strings mix two types of intervals , four perfect @-@ fourths and the major third between the G and B strings : 
 E @-@ A @-@ D @-@ G @-@ B @-@ E. 
 Only major thirds occur as open @-@ string intervals for major @-@ thirds tuning , which is also called " major @-@ third tuning " , " all @-@ thirds tuning " , and " M3 tuning " . A popular M3 tuning has the open strings 
 G ♯ -C @-@ E @-@ G ♯ -C @-@ E , 
 in which the low G ♯ is a major third above the low E of standard tuning . Consequently , a seventh string for the low E is often added to restore the standard E @-@ E range . While M3 tuning can use standard sets of guitar strings , specialized string gauges have been recommended . Besides this M3 tuning , which has the open notes { G ♯ , C , E } , there are exactly three other M3 tunings , which have distinct sets of open @-@ note pitch classes . The other major @-@ thirds tunings respectively have the open notes { A , C ♯ , F } , { A ♯ , D , F ♯ } , and { B , D ♯ , G } . For six @-@ string guitars , the M3 tuning 
 F ♯ -A ♯ -D @-@ F ♯ -A ♯ -D 
 loses the two lowest semitones on the low @-@ E string and the two highest semitones from the high @-@ E string in standard tuning ; it can use string sets for standard tuning . 
 = = Properties = = 
 Major @-@ thirds tunings require less hand @-@ stretching than other tunings , because each M3 tuning packs the octave 's twelve notes into four consecutive frets . The major @-@ third intervals allow major chords and minor chords to be played with two – three consecutive fingers on two consecutive frets . Every major @-@ thirds tuning is regular and repetitive , two properties that facilitate learning by beginners and improvisation by advanced guitarists . 
 = = = Four frets for the four fingers = = = 
 In major @-@ thirds tuning , the chromatic scale is arranged on three consecutive strings in four consecutive frets . This four @-@ fret arrangement facilitates the left @-@ hand technique for classical ( Spanish ) guitar : For each hand position of four frets , the hand is stationary and the fingers move , each finger being responsible for one fret . Consequently , three hand @-@ positions ( covering frets 1 – 4 , 5 – 8 , and 9 – 12 ) partition the fingerboard of classical guitar , which has exactly 12 frets . 
 Only two or three frets are needed for the guitar chords — major , minor , and dominant sevenths — which are emphasized in introductions to guitar @-@ playing and to the fundamentals of music . Each major and minor chord can be played on two successive frets on three successive strings , and therefore each needs only two fingers . Other chords — seconds , fourths , sevenths , and ninths — are played on only three successive frets . For fundamental @-@ chord fingerings , major @-@ thirds tuning 's simplicity and consistency are not shared by standard tuning , whose seventh @-@ chord fingering is discussed at the end of this section . 
 = = = Repetition = = = 
 Each major @-@ thirds tuning repeats its open @-@ notes after every two strings , which results in two copies of the three open @-@ strings ' notes , each in a different octave . This repetition again simplifies the learning of chords and improvisation . This advantage is not shared by two popular regular @-@ tunings , all @-@ fourths and all @-@ fifths tuning . 
 Chord inversion is especially simple in major @-@ thirds tuning . Chords are inverted simply by raising one or two notes three strings . The raised notes are played with the same finger as the original notes . Thus , major and minor chords are played on two frets in M3 tuning even when they are inverted . In contrast , inversions of chords in standard tuning require three fingers on a span of four frets , in standard tuning , the shape of inversions depends on the involvement of the irregular major @-@ third . 
 = = = Regular musical @-@ intervals = = = 
 In each regular tuning , the musical intervals are the same for each pair of consecutive strings . Other regular tunings include all @-@ fourths , augmented @-@ fourths , and all @-@ fifths tunings . For each regular tuning , chord patterns may be moved around the fretboard , a property that simplifies beginners ' learning of chords and advanced players ' improvisation . 
 In contrast , chords cannot be shifted around the fretboard in standard tuning , which requires four chord @-@ shapes for the major chords : There are separate fingerings for chords having root notes on one of the four strings three – six . 
 = = = = Shifting chords : Vertical and diagonal = = = = 
 The repetition of the major @-@ thirds tuning enables notes and chords to be raised one octave by being vertically shifted by three strings . Notes and chords may be shifted diagonally in major @-@ thirds tuning , by combining a vertical shift of one string with a horizontal shift of four frets : " Like all regular tunings , chords in the major third tuning can be moved across the fretboard ( ascending or descending a major third for each string ) .... " 
 In standard tuning , playing scales of one octave requires three patterns , which depend on the string of the root note . Chords cannot be shifted diagonally without changing finger @-@ patterns . Standard tuning has four finger @-@ patterns for musical intervals , four forms for basic major @-@ chords , and three forms for the inversion of the basic major @-@ chords . 
 = = = Open chords and beginning players = = = 
 Major @-@ thirds tunings are unconventional open tunings , in which the open strings form an augmented triad . In M3 tunings , the augmented fifth replaces the perfect fifth of the major triad , which is used in conventional open @-@ tunings . For example , the C @-@ augmented triad ( C , E , G ♯ ) has a G ♯ in place of the C @-@ major triad 's G. ( The note G ♯ is <unk> equivalent to A ♭ , as noted above . ) Consequently , M3 tunings are also called ( open ) augmented @-@ fifth tunings ( in French " La guitare # 5 , majeure <unk> <unk> " ) . 
 Instructional literature uses standard tuning . Traditionally a course begins with the hand in first position , that is , with the left @-@ hand covering frets 1 – 4 . Beginning players first learn open chords belonging to the major keys C , G , and D. Guitarists who play mainly open chords in these three major @-@ keys and their relative minor @-@ keys ( Am , Em , Bm ) may prefer standard tuning over an M3 tuning . In particular , hobbyists playing folk music around a campfire are well served by standard tuning . Such hobbyists may also play major @-@ thirds tuning , which also has many open chords with notes on five or six strings ; chords with five @-@ six strings have greater volume than chords with three @-@ four strings and so are useful for acoustic guitars ( for example , acoustic @-@ electric guitars without amplification ) . 
 Intermediate guitarists do not limit themselves to one hand @-@ position , and consequently open chords are only part of their chordal repertoire . In contemporary music , master guitarists " think diagonally and move up and down the strings " ; fluency on the entire fretboard is needed particularly by guitarists playing jazz . According to its inventor , Ralph Patt , major @-@ thirds tuning 
 " makes the hard things easy and the easy things hard . [ ... ] This is never going to take the place of folk guitar , and it 's not meant to . For difficult music , and for where we are going in free jazz and even the old be @-@ bop jazz , this is a much easier way to play . " 
 = = = Left @-@ handed chords = = = 
 Major @-@ thirds tuning is closely related to minor @-@ sixths tuning , which is the regular tuning that is based on the minor sixth , the interval of eight semitones . Either ascending by a major third or by descending by a minor sixth , one arrives at the same pitch class , the same note representing pitches in different octaves . Intervals paired like the pair of major @-@ third and minor @-@ sixth intervals are termed " inverse intervals " in the theory of music . Consequently , chord charts for minor @-@ sixths tunings may be used for left @-@ handed major @-@ thirds tunings ; conversely , chord charts for major @-@ thirds tunings may be used for left @-@ handed minor @-@ sixths tunings . 
 = = = <unk> of seventh chords = = = 
 Major @-@ thirds tuning facilitates playing chords with closed voicings . In contrast , standard tuning would require more hand @-@ stretching to play closed @-@ voice seventh chords , and so standard tuning uses open voicings for many four @-@ note chords , for example of dominant seventh chords . By definition , a dominant seventh is a four @-@ note chord combining a major chord and a minor seventh . For example , the C7 seventh chord combines the C @-@ major chord { C , E , G } with B ♭ . In standard tuning , extending the root @-@ bass C @-@ major chord ( C , E , G ) to a C7 chord ( C , E , G , B ♭ ) would span six frets ( 3 – 8 ) ; such seventh chords " contain some pretty serious stretches in the left hand " . An illustration shows this C7 voicing ( C , E , G , B ♭ ) , which would be extremely difficult to play in standard tuning , besides the openly voiced C7 @-@ chord that is conventional in standard tuning : This open @-@ position C7 chord is termed a second @-@ inversion C7 drop 2 chord ( C , G , B ♭ , E ) , because the second @-@ highest note ( C ) in the second @-@ inversion C7 chord ( G , B ♭ , C , E ) is lowered by an octave . 
 = = History = = 
 Major @-@ thirds tuning was introduced in 1964 by jazz @-@ guitarist Ralph Patt . He was studying with Gunther Schuller , whose twelve @-@ tone technique was invented for atonal composition by his teacher , Arnold Schoenberg . Patt was also inspired by the free jazz of Ornette Coleman and John Coltrane . Seeking a guitar @-@ tuning that would facilitate improvisation using twelve @-@ tones , he introduced major @-@ thirds tuning by 1964 , perhaps in 1963 . To achieve the E @-@ E open @-@ string range of standard ( Spanish ) tuning , Patt started using seven @-@ string guitars in 1963 , before settling on eight @-@ string guitars with high G ♯ ( equivalently A ♭ ) as their highest open @-@ notes . Patt used major @-@ thirds tuning during all of his work as a session musician after 1965 in New York . Patt developed a webpage with extensive information about major @-@ thirds tuning . 
 = Hurricane Danny ( 2015 ) = 
 Hurricane Danny in August 2015 was the first major hurricane to develop between the Lesser Antilles and Western Africa since Hurricane Julia in 2010 . The hurricane originated from a well @-@ defined tropical wave that emerged over the Atlantic Ocean on August 14 . Traveling west , the system gradually coalesced into a tropical depression by August 18 . After becoming a tropical storm later that day , dry air slowed further development . On August 20 – 21 , dry air became removed from the system , and Danny rapidly intensified into a Category 3 on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . Its peak was short @-@ lived as wind shear soon increased and prompted significant weakening . <unk> to a tropical storm by August 23 , Danny approached the Lesser Antilles . It degenerated into a tropical wave as it traversed the archipelago on August 24 and was last noted over Hispaniola the following day . 
 The hurricane prompted the issuance of several tropical storm warnings for the Lesser Antilles . Leeward Islands Air Transport cancelled 40 flights and sandbags were distributed in the United States Virgin Islands . Danny ultimately only brought light rain to the region , with its effects considered beneficial due to a severe drought . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 On August 14 , 2015 , a well @-@ defined tropical wave , accompanied by significant surface pressure falls , traversed Western Africa and emerged over the Atlantic Ocean that evening . A broad surface low developed along the wave on August 15 . Embedded within monsoon flow , various environmental factors enabled gradual development of the disturbance , including low wind shear , above @-@ average sea surface temperatures , moderate moisture content , and favorable diffluence . A subtropical ridge to the north steered the system generally west @-@ northwest throughout its entire existence . On August 17 , the surface low became increasingly defined and convection more persistent . It subsequently acquired enough organization to be classified a tropical depression — the fourth of the 2015 season — at 06 : 00 UTC on August 18 . At this time , it was situated about 825 mi ( 1 @,@ 325 km ) west @-@ southwest of Praia , Cape Verde . 
 The depression traversed a region generally favoring further development ; however , occasional intrusions of dry air from the Saharan Air Layer initially inhibited rapid growth . The system reached tropical storm @-@ status by 12 : 00 UTC on August 18 — based on satellite intensity estimates using the Dvorak Technique — and it was assigned the name Danny accordingly . Banding features developed around the circulation early on August 19 . A temporary intrusion of dry air caused convection to collapse later that day , but cloud cover redeveloped within hours . Improving upper @-@ level outflow supported the formation of a central dense overcast and a 12 mi ( 19 km ) wide @-@ eye soon developed . Danny reached hurricane @-@ strength by 12 : 00 UTC on August 20 , by which time it was located 1 @,@ 095 mi ( 1 @,@ 760 km ) east of the Windward Islands . A trough over the mid @-@ Atlantic weakened the subtropical ridge and caused the hurricane to move at a relatively slow pace of 10 mph ( 16 km / h ) . 
 An unusually small hurricane , with gale @-@ force winds extending only 60 mi ( 95 km ) from its center , Danny was prone to significant fluctuations in intensity , making forecasts particularly difficult . Indeed , the storm soon underwent an unpredicted period of rapid intensification aided by nearly non @-@ existent upper @-@ level wind shear . Low @-@ level moisture wrapped around the circulation during this phase , mitigating the influence of the Saharan Air Layer . Danny achieved its peak intensity around 12 : 00 UTC on August 21 as a Category 3 on the Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale ; maximum sustained winds were estimated at 125 mph 205 km / h ) alongside a barometric pressure of 960 mbar ( hPa ) ; 28 @.@ 35 inHg ) . Shortly thereafter , increasing shear and dry air initiated a rapid weakening phase . The storm 's eye became obscured by clouds and disappeared from satellite image late on August 21 . 
 Throughout August 22 , Danny 's structure deteriorated with its surface and mid @-@ level circulations becoming tilted with height due to the shear . The surface low soon became exposed with convection displaced to the northeast , and Danny weakened to a tropical storm by 00 : 00 UTC on August 23 . The storm briefly leveled off in intensity somewhat later that day , with its circulation back under convection ; intense lightning was observed near the cyclone 's center . Late on August 23 , Danny 's structure began degrading once more with its circulation becoming significantly displaced from the remaining ragged convection . Early on August 24 , Hurricane Hunters struggled to find a circulation center as Danny neared the Lesser Antilles , and the system weakened to a tropical depression by 12 : 00 UTC as it passed between Guadeloupe and Dominica . Hours later it degenerated into a tropical wave , marking its dissipating as a tropical cyclone . The remnants of Danny continued to the west @-@ northwest for another day and was last noted over Hispaniola . 
 = = Preparations and impact = = 
 On August 22 , governments across the Lesser Antilles issued tropical storm watches . The islands of Antigua , Anguilla , Barbuda , Montserrat , Nevis , Saba , St. Eustatius , and St. Kitts were placed under a tropical storm warning the following day . These advisories were discontinued following Danny 's degradation to a tropical depression on August 24 . Leeward Islands Air Transport cancelled 40 flights across the eastern Caribbean due to the hurricane and cruise ships altered their courses . Although members of the Haiti Office of Civil Protection issued an official statement to residents saying Danny was not a threat to the country , they convened to discuss potential preparations and the status of emergency supplies . Officials in the United States Virgin Islands distributed sandbags and opened shelters . Météo @-@ France issued an " orange " alert for Guadeloupe Saint Barthélemy , and Saint Martin , advising residents about heavy rain and strong winds . Officials in Guadeloupe shut down several roads a precautionary measure . The expected rainfall was welcomed across the entire affected region , which was suffering from a severe drought . 
 About 2 in ( 51 mm ) of rain fell in Dominica , leading to minor rockslides , and 1 @.@ 5 in ( 38 mm ) was observed in Antigua . Some disruption to electrical and water supplies occurred on Guadeloupe . Rainfall was less than expected across Puerto Rico , with most areas receiving less than 1 in ( 25 mm ) ; a peak value of 2 @.@ 01 in ( 51 mm ) was observed in Naguabo . The <unk> Dam , then at a critically low 110 @.@ 7 ft ( 33 @.@ 74 m ) , received 1 @.@ 5 in ( 38 mm ) . Though relatively light , the accumulations increased the water level by 12 in ( 30 cm ) . Similarly , water levels at the Fajardo Dam rose by 9 @.@ 8 in ( 25 cm ) . 
 Just a few days after Danny , Tropical Storm Erika brought devastating floods to Dominica , killing 30 people and wrecking tremendous damage . Other Caribbean islands received additional rainfall from the storm . 
 = Jack F. Matlock , Jr . = 
 Jack Foust Matlock , Jr . ( born October 1 , 1929 ) is an American former ambassador , career Foreign Service Officer , a teacher , a historian , and a linguist . He was a specialist in Soviet affairs during some of the most tumultuous years of the Cold War , and served as U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union from 1987 to 1991 . 
 Matlock became interested in Russia as a Duke University undergraduate , and after studies at Columbia University and a stint as a Russian @-@ language instructor at Dartmouth College , entered the Foreign Service in 1956 . His 35 @-@ year career encompassed much of the Cold War period between the Soviet Union and the United States . His first assignment to Moscow was in 1961 , and it was from the embassy there that he experienced the 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis , helping to translate diplomatic messages between the leaders . The next year he was posted to West Africa , and he later served in East Africa , during the post @-@ colonial period of superpower rivalry . 
 At the beginning of détente , he was Director of Soviet Affairs in the State Department , and began to participate in the summit meetings between the leaders , eventually attending all but one of the U.S. – Soviet summits held in the 20 @-@ year period 1972 – 91 . Matlock was back in Moscow in 1974 , serving in the number two position in the embassy for four years . The Soviet invasion of Afghanistan in early 1980 ended the period of reduced tensions . Matlock was assigned to Moscow again in 1981 as acting ambassador during the first part of Ronald Reagan 's presidency . Reagan appointed him as ambassador to Czechoslovakia and later asked him to return to Washington in 1983 to work at the National Security Council , with the assignment to develop a negotiating strategy to end the arms race . When Mikhail Gorbachev became the leader of the Soviet Union in 1985 , arms negotiations and summit meetings resumed . Matlock was appointed ambassador to the Soviet Union in 1987 and saw the last years of the Soviet Union before he retired from the Foreign Service in 1991 . 
 After leaving the Foreign Service , he wrote an account of the end of the Soviet Union titled Autopsy on an Empire , followed by an account of the end of the Cold War titled Reagan and Gorbachev : How the Cold War Ended , establishing his reputation as a historian . He joined the faculty of the Institute for Advanced Study and he went on to teach diplomacy at several New England colleges . He and his wife Rebecca live in Princeton , New Jersey . 
 = = Biography = = 
 Born in 1929 in Greensboro , North Carolina , Jack Matlock graduated from Greensboro Senior High School ( see Grimsley High School ) in 1946 , married Rebecca <unk> in 1949 , graduated summa cum laude from Duke University in 1950 , and later earned an M.A. from Columbia University in 1952 . He taught Russian language and literature at Dartmouth College from 1953 to 1956 . 
 He joined the Foreign Service in 1956 , and served in Vienna , Garmisch @-@ Partenkirchen , Moscow , Accra , Zanzibar , and Dar es Salaam . He was Director of Soviet Affairs in the State Department ( 1971 – 74 ) , Diplomat in Residence at Vanderbilt University ( 1978 – 79 ) , and Deputy Director of the Foreign Service Institute ( 1979 – 80 ) . He served as U.S. Ambassador to Czechoslovakia ( 1981 – 83 ) and as Special Assistant to the President for National Security Affairs and Senior Director for European and Soviet Affairs on the National Security Council Staff ( 1983 – 86 ) . His languages are Czech , French , German , Russian , and Swahili . 
 Matlock was US President Ronald Reagan 's choice for the position of ambassador to the Soviet Union , serving from 1987 to 1991 . His previous tours in Moscow were as Vice Consul and Third Secretary ( 1961 – 1963 ) , Minister Counsellor and Deputy Chief of Mission ( 1974 – 1978 ) , and Chargé d ’ <unk> ad interim ( 1981 ) . 
 After he retired from the Foreign Service in 1991 , Matlock reentered the academic world , becoming the Kathryn and Shelby Cullom Davis Professor of the Practice of International Diplomacy at Columbia . After five years in that position he moved to the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton , New Jersey , where he was George F. Kennan Professor from 1996 to 2001 . Matlock has held visiting appointments at the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton University , at Hamilton College , at the Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs and at Mount Holyoke College . He has been awarded honorary doctorates by Greensboro College , Albright College and Connecticut College . Matlock completed his dissertation and received his Ph.D. from the Columbia University Graduate School of Arts and Sciences at their commencement ceremony on May 22 , 2013 . 
 Jack and Rebecca Matlock now divide their time between a home in Princeton and Rebecca 's family farm in <unk> , Tennessee . They have five children and three grandchildren . 
 = = Captivated by Russia = = 
 By his own account , Matlock became captivated by Russia having read Dostoyevsky as an undergraduate at Duke University . He went on to study Russian language and area studies at the Russian Institute at Columbia University , and became convinced that the principal challenge of American diplomacy in the post World War II period would be dealing with the Soviet Union . After his 1953 appointment to a position as Russian Instructor at Dartmouth College , he supplemented his income by preparing an index to Joseph Stalin ’ s collected works on contract with the State Department . Because in 1956 the Soviet Union was a closed society , he decided his best chance to get to know Russia was to join the Foreign Service and become a diplomat . His ultimate career goal was clear from the beginning : 
 … when I entered the Foreign Service I shocked a lot of people by what seemed to be overweening ambition when I was asked " What do you want out of the Foreign Service ? " I stated frankly , " I want to be the American ambassador to the Soviet Union . " 
 = = Moscow : as Third Secretary = = 
 After a tour in Vienna , Austria and Russian language training at the U.S. Army Russian Institute in Oberammergau , Matlock arrived in Moscow for the first time in 1961 . Initially a Vice Consul , Matlock met with individuals seeking to visit or emigrate to the United States . His most famous case was Lee Harvey Oswald , who applied for a repatriation loan to return to the United States after having previously moved to the Soviet Union . 
 After a year , Matlock was promoted to Third Secretary in the Political Section . American foreign policy with regard to the Soviet Union , known as containment , had been articulated in 1947 by George F. Kennan , who was later to become a good friend of Matlock ’ s . The American policy was basically to contain the spread of Communism , in the expectation that it would eventually collapse of internal contradictions . This did not prevent discussions between the Superpowers . In June 1961 , President John F. Kennedy and First Secretary Nikita Khrushchev met in Vienna , and in December the United Nations General Assembly approved a draft joint resolution on principles for negotiating disarmament . This period also saw the beginnings of U.S. - U.S.S.R. cultural exchanges , notably the visit of poet Robert Frost to Moscow . 
 The containment policy was tested during the October 1962 Cuban Missile Crisis . Matlock , along with Richard Davies and Herbert Okun , translated communications between President John F. Kennedy and Nikita Khrushchev . 
 = = Ghana and Tanzania = = 
 In late 1963 , the <unk> left Moscow for West Africa , arriving in Accra , Ghana . Kwame Nkrumah had become the first president of newly independent Ghana and post @-@ colonial Africa was to be a venue for competition between the U.S. and Soviet Union for influence . 
 In 1967 , Matlock was sent to East Africa to serve on Zanzibar as consul . It was his first opportunity to be head of a Foreign Service post . His predecessor as consul , Frank Carlucci , was later to become Secretary of Defense , and his successor , Thomas R. Pickering , was later to become Ambassador to the U.N .. 
 Matlock 's next assignment was as Deputy Chief of Mission in the capital of Tanzania , Dar es Salaam . Even in Africa , knowledge of Soviet Affairs proved useful . With Leonid Brezhnev in power , Soviet foreign policy as of 1968 was dictated by the Brezhnev Doctrine , which held that , once a country became Communist , it was never to leave the Soviet sphere of influence . 
 = = Washington : as Director of Soviet Affairs = = 
 In 1971 Matlock became Director of Soviet Affairs in the State Department . During Richard Nixon 's presidency , a period known as détente , there was a reduction of Cold War tension . Matlock participated in the negotiation of arms control treaties and other bilateral agreements . In fact , he attended every one of the U.S.-Soviet summits for the 20 @-@ year period 1972 – 1991 , with the exception of the 1979 Carter - Brezhnev summit . 
 = = Moscow : as Deputy Chief of Mission = = 
 After four years in Washington , he spent four years as Deputy Chief of Mission ( DCM ) , the number two position , at Embassy Moscow . These years cemented his reputation within the State Department as a Soviet expert . In early 1976 , the State Department made public the fact that the Soviet Union had been beaming microwaves at the Moscow Embassy from a nearby building for many years . This caused concern about possible health effects of the low @-@ level microwave radiation . Ironically , it was Soviet research that documented the psychological symptoms of sensitivity to microwave exposure . In the United States , the standards for safe exposure to microwaves were much more lenient than in the Soviet Union . 
 The August 26 , 1977 ABC Evening News covered the story of a major fire at the embassy . Despite the severity of the fire , all personnel were evacuated safely , and the efforts of the embassy staff elicited a commendation from President Jimmy Carter . Former KGB agent Victor <unk> testified before Congress in 1998 that the fire was deliberately induced by the Soviets in an effort to gain access to sensitive areas by agents posing as firemen .

 Matlock returned to the United States and taught for a year at Vanderbilt University under the ' Diplomats in Residence ' program . The following year , he came to Washington DC to take the number two position at the Foreign Service Institute , the State Department ’ s language training school . 
 In January 1980 , in response to the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan , President Carter postponed consideration of the SALT @-@ 2 Treaty and imposed a trade embargo . Also in 1980 , the new embassy under construction in Moscow was found to be so riddled with listening devices that it would be unusable for secure work . 
 = = Moscow : as Chargé d 'Affaires = = 
 Matlock returned to Moscow in 1981 as acting Ambassador , or Chargé d ’ <unk> . By April 24 , President Reagan had cancelled the export embargo , and trade resumed . Matlock signalled the American desire for constructive engagement with the Soviets : 
 We are seeking an active dialogue on all levels . But a dialogue is useful only if it is candid , and we must learn not to take offense at candor but to use it to help us understand each other . - Jack F. Matlock , Jr . ( New York Times Quote of the Day for July 5 , 1981 ) 
 On August 6 , 1981 President Reagan ordered the development of a neutron bomb . While contentious , this had the desired effect of bringing the Soviets to the bargaining table , and negotiations on limiting nuclear weapons in Europe started on November 30 . 
 = = Czechoslovakia : as Ambassador = = 
 In late 1980 Matlock had been appointed Ambassador to Czechoslovakia by President Jimmy Carter . However , the appointment was not ratified by the Senate before Carter ’ s election loss , and so it was with Ronald Reagan ’ s re @-@ appointment in 1981 that he became Ambassador to Czechoslovakia . During his tenure , he was able to help resolve a major impediment to good relations : the return of 18 @.@ 4 tons of gold that had been looted by the Nazis in World War II and kept , ever since its recovery by Allied forces , in American and British banks . 
 On March 23 , 1983 , President Reagan announced the Strategic Defense Initiative , a ground and space @-@ based weapons system designed to protect from nuclear attack . Matlock continued to advise the President on policy toward the Soviet Union and on September 1 , 1983 , when the Soviets shot down commercial flight KAL 007 , Matlock returned to Washington to work with White House officials . 
 = = Washington : National Security Council = = 
 Reagan appointed Matlock to the position of Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director of European and Soviet Affairs in the National Security Council ( NSC ) in order to develop a negotiating strategy to end the arms race . Earlier in the year , the long @-@ standing containment strategy toward the U.S.S.R. had been modified by Matlock 's predecessor Richard Pipes to include bringing internal pressure on the Soviets while conducting negotiations in the mutual interest . In following years , discussions with the Soviets were conducted under Matlock 's " Four @-@ Part Agenda " including Human Rights , Regional Issues , Arms Control , and Bilateral Issues . 
 On November 25 , 1983 , Soviet leader Yuri Andropov announced the resumption of nuclear missile deployment in the western U.S.S.R. , a sign of the increased tension in the relationship . The thaw in relations can be taken to begin with Ronald Reagan 's January 16 , 1984 speech declaring that the U.S. and U.S.S.R. had " common interests and the foremost among them is to avoid war and reduce the level of arms " in which he added that " I support a zero option for all nuclear arms . " While the speech was commonly seen as propaganda , Lawrence S. <unk> , professor of History at the State University of New York - Albany says of it that " a number of <unk> its writer , Jack Matlock <unk> contended that it was meant to be taken seriously by Soviet leaders . " On June 30 , 1984 , the Soviets offered to start negotiations on nuclear and space @-@ based weapons . 
 = = Gorbachev period = = 
 Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in the Soviet Union on March 11 , 1985 , and the next day negotiations on nuclear and space @-@ based weapons began in Geneva . A few weeks later , he proposed a moratorium on the development of nuclear and space weapons during the period of negotiations , and in July , he proposed to ban nuclear testing . Reagan rejected the proposals . 
 Gorbachev began a period of internal economic restructuring , known as perestroika , and agreed to a series of summits with the American president . Matlock was instrumental in preparing Reagan for his first summit with Gorbachev , arranging for specialists within the government to write a “ Soviet Union 101 ” course of 21 papers on Russia for Reagan to study . Matlock also participated in a mock summit , playing the role of Gorbachev , allowing Reagan to practice the encounter in advance . 
 Speaking at a Chautauqua conference in <unk> , Latvia in June 1986 , Matlock told the crowd that the United States did not recognize the incorporation of the Baltic States into the Soviet Union . His remarks are credited by <unk> <unk> , leader of the Popular Front of Latvia , with galvanizing the independence movement in Latvia . 
 U.S.-Soviet relations took a turn for the worse with the Soviet ’ s arrest of U.S. reporter Nicholas Daniloff , evidently for use as a bargaining chip in response to the August 30 , 1986 arrest of suspected KGB agent <unk> Zakharov . Since Daniloff was not engaged in espionage , Matlock advised taking a hard line with the Soviets . While charges against Daniloff were dropped , a diplomatic row ensued , leading by the end of October , to the expulsion of 100 Soviets , including 80 suspected intelligence officers . The U.S. lost 10 diplomats from Embassy Moscow , along with all 260 of the Russian support staff . 
 = = Moscow : as Ambassador = = 
 In April 1987 Reagan appointed Matlock as Ambassador to the Soviet Union . Conditions at the Embassy were tense , as Marine Sergeant Clayton <unk> had been found to have compromised Embassy security . Within a few months of the <unk> scandal , all U.S. intelligence assets in the Soviet Union had been exposed . The Americans suspected that the security breach had meant that the Embassy code room was no longer secure and worked frantically to determine how . It was not until 1994 that Aldrich Ames , a mole within the CIA , was caught . Another mole , Robert Hanssen , this time within the FBI , was caught only in 2001 . 
 During 1987 , relations improved steadily , with U.S. military inspectors present at Soviet military manoeuvres , an agreement to establish centers on Reducing Nuclear Threat , and a first round of negotiations aimed at banning nuclear tests . The thaw in relations was reflected in the cultural sphere . Matlock ’ s invitation to ballerina Maya Plisetskaya to attend a reception at <unk> House provided a way for Matlock to judge Gorbachev ’ s intentions , as earlier Soviet leaders would have considered it a provocation . 
 A second embassy fire in February 1988 damaged several floors of the chancery . 
 Improvements in relations continued during the year , with two summit meetings , the first in Moscow and the second on Governor ’ s Island in New York . An earthquake struck Armenia during the second summit , cutting it short . However , a U.S. offer of assistance to the victims was accepted by Gorbachev , and became the first official assistance by the U.S. since World War II . 
 The Berlin Wall fell on November 9 , 1989 , and on November 15 , the U.S. and U.S.S.R. submitted a joint resolution to the United Nations on the Consolidation of International Peace , Security and Cooperation , the first such joint initiative . A December meeting in Malta brought Gorbachev and George H. W. Bush together for their first summit . 
 The June 1990 summit in Washington brought several bilateral agreements , covering chemical weapons , trade , aviation , grain , maritime boundaries , peaceful uses of atomic energy , ocean exploration , student exchanges , and customs cooperation . The September meeting in Helsinki provided a venue for discussion of the Persian Gulf War . 
 A third fire in the embassy occurred in April 1991 , and this time the KGB may have managed to send in agents disguised as firefighters . 
 In June 1991 , Matlock , received word of a coup planned against Gorbachev , and warned him . It was to no avail ; shortly after his July summit with Bush , Gorbachev was briefly removed from power by the August 1991 coup . 
 The Soviet Union collapsed by the end of 1991 , just a few months after Matlock , having fulfilled his ambition when he joined the Foreign Service , retired from a diplomatic career spanning 35 years .

 After retirement from the Foreign Service , Matlock began work on his magnum opus , Autopsy on an Empire : The American Ambassador 's Account of the Collapse of the Soviet Union . This 836 page book details the final years of the Soviet Union , and is considered by many to be the definitive insider 's guide to the subject . 
 A subsequent book , Reagan and Gorbachev : How the Cold War Ended describes the relationship of the two men and their efforts to reach agreement on arms reductions between the superpowers . Matlock takes the position that the military build @-@ up by Ronald Reagan in the early @-@ 1980s has contributed to the inaccurate characterization of Reagan as a war hawk . The quote atop the first page of Reagan and Gorbachev is by Ronald Reagan , speaking in 1981 during the beginnings of a one trillion dollar defense spending surge , that states " I 've always recognized that ultimately there 's got to be a settlement , a solution . " 
 Reagan , according to Matlock , never altered from his goals as <unk> at his first press conference as President when he stated that , appearances to the contrary , he was in favor of " an actual reduction in the numbers of nuclear weapons . " This would contradict the claims of Reagan @-@ victory @-@ school proponents such as Peter Schweitzer . 
 His third book , Superpower Illusions : How Myths and False Ideologies Led America <unk> How to Return to Reality , published in 2010 , provides an analysis of the post Cold War period along with his policy prescriptions . 
 = = Teaching Diplomacy = = 
 Matlock has taught diplomacy at Princeton University , Columbia University and Hamilton College . In a 1997 interview , Matlock offers some advice to prospective diplomats : have an optimistic nature , get a liberal education , do not expect to change the world , know the country , know your own country , faithfully represent your government , find the mutual interests , and remember that timing is everything . 
 Matlock also gives his views on one of the basic distinctions in politics : 
 I don 't see much difference between a communist regime and a fascist regime . In fact , I think one of the greatest intellectual confusions that many have had over these decades is the whole right and left thing -- fascists are on the right , communists are on the left . Nonsense ! They come together and overlap , and we 're seeing this in Russia today where the allies are the nationalistic chauvinists and the communists . They are natural allies because they are <unk> by nature . And more than <unk> , they tend to be <unk> , which means that they tend to destroy all of the elements of the civil society . To me that 's much more important than whether you 're philosophically right or left . You know , are you willing to create and live in a civil society , in an open society , or not ? That to me is the basic issue . 
 = = U.S. policy and politics = = 
 After leaving government service , Matlock has occasionally joined with other experts to criticize U.S. government policy . On June 26 , 1997 , he signed an Open Letter to Bill Clinton criticizing plans for NATO expansion . His reason for opposition , as given in his testimony before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee , is the belief that NATO expansion will preclude significant nuclear arms reduction with Russia , and consequently increase the risk of a terrorist nuclear attack . 
 Matlock drew the ire of many Republicans during the 2004 Presidential election when he signed the Diplomats and Military Commanders for Change Official Statement of June 16 , 2004 , criticizing the policies of George W. Bush and endorsing John Kerry for President . 
 On Jan 4 , 2007 , Matlock joined with George Shultz , William Perry , Henry Kissinger and Sam Nunn to advocate a goal of a world free of nuclear weapons . On 23 September 2008 after a two @-@ day conference at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , he joined several other former ambassadors to issue a joint statement on how Russia and the United States might move forward in their relations . He has endorsed the Global Zero Initiative , a plan to eliminate all nuclear weapons by 2030 . Matlock has also signed an open letter of May 13 , 2011 asking the implementors of the New START treaty between the U.S. Russia to make public the locations and aggregate numbers of nuclear weapons , in order to promote transparency and reduce mistrust . 
 On Jan 18 , 2011 he co @-@ signed an open letter to President Obama urging a United Nations resolution condemning Israeli settlements in the occupied territory .
