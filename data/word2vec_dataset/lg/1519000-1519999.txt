 " New York " was met with mixed reviews by many critics . Erica Futterman of Rolling Stone wrote , " We didn 't actually expect the New Directions to win nationals , but the episode just felt like it was going through the motions rather than seizing the opportunity to do something truly spectacular . " A.V. Club 's Todd VanDerWerff called the episode a " good piece of television " , and gave it a " B + " . He said it " wasn 't as good " as the first @-@ season finale , " Journey to Regionals " , " largely because it wasted a lot of time on performances designed solely to show off how the show was actually in New York and also because it borrowed a lot of that episode 's set pieces without finding anything remotely as powerful as the performance of ' Bohemian Rhapsody ' " . Robert Canning of IGN gave " New York " a " good " grade of 7 @.@ 5 out of 10 and stated , " while not as epic as Nationals in New York should have been , ' New York ' was a decent close to an enjoyable season . " The Atlantic 's Meghan Brown said the episode was " an uneven end to an uneven season , with a few killer numbers , strange resolutions , and head @-@ scratching plot devices " , while her colleague Kevin Fallon opined that the season finale was " no exception " to Glee having " been undeniably frustrating in season two " , though " there was still ample reason to tune in and enjoy " . 
 Several elements of the episode were highlighted for their implausibility . The arrival of New Directions in New York without having their songs already prepared received widespread condemnation , including from VanDerWerff and the Houston Chronicle 's Bobby Hankinson , and led Brown to write , " there is absolutely no universe in which that makes sense . At all . It was so logically unsound that it was distracting . " The notion that Rachel would not know that Cats had closed eleven years before was derided by Brown and Amy Reiter of the Los Angeles Times , while Rachel and Kurt 's encounter with " the only friendly security guard in New York City " was mocked by Anthony Benigno of The Faster Times and Entertainment Weekly 's Sandra Gonzalez . Several critics were disappointed that Quinn 's ominous mention of plans for New York in " Funeral " came to nothing , including Benigno , who called her actual idea a " <unk> sabotage plot " , though he credited Agron 's scene as a " great , wasted job in a great , wasted character " , sentiments echoed by VanDerWerff and James Poniewozik of Time . Terron R. Moore of <unk> gave the episode a " C + " , and likened Quinn 's dropped plot to Will leaving for Broadway and Rachel disowning her love for Finn : " the fact that none of this happened — and the fact that we know none of it would ever happen — is just another issue I have with the show . I hope that next season , it actually grows a pair . " 
 Finn and Rachel 's date in New York was praised , though not everyone was happy with its ending . Gonzalez liked LuPone 's short guest spot , and hoped it would be " a lesson to producers in how to deal with guest appearances in the future " . Canning said the date had a " sweet comical tone " , and thought the episode was " the best the series has done so far with this couple " . Reiter felt Rachel was making a " false " choice in her refusal of Finn at the end of the date , and wondered " couldn 't she at least have asked him " if he would consider coming to New York . At the competition performance , Poniewozik said of the end of " Pretending " , " I may not be that invested in Finn / Rachel , but the startling moment where the audience disappeared in the middle of their kiss made me feel like I was . " Benigno called the moment " awesome " , and VanDerWerff was also pleased . 
 Those reviewers who singled out the show 's final segment , set after the return to Ohio , did so with compliments . Poniewozik wrote that the episode " did a really fine job handling its epilogue , in which New Directions had their hopes crushed , went back to Lima — and found that it was a pretty awesome experience regardless . Brittany connected with Santana , a brief scene that reminded me how far both characters have come this season . Kurt didn 't get a championship , but he has Blaine , and he has a taste of what life can be like for him after graduation . " Canning said it was a " nice denouement , putting everyone at peace for having failed to reach the top ten at Nationals and getting their hopes high for next year . " Hankinson credited Brittany with some of the funniest lines in the episode as well as the most important scene — in the epilogue with Santana — and he was impressed with her lead vocals throughout . He concluded , " She 's the <unk> of the night and possibly the season . " 
 = = = Music and performances = = = 
 The musical performances received a mixed reaction from critics , both as a whole and individually . Poniewozik said the songs " mostly felt like padding , without anything that offered a strong connection of contrast with the story . " VanDerWerff called the music his least favorite element of the episode , and was only complimentary about " Bella Notte " . Brittany 's original song , " My Cup " , was called " light and fun " by Benigno . Kubicek characterized it as " another brilliantly absurd original song " , and Canning said it was a " hilarious performance " . While Brett Berk of Vanity Fair stated that it was " amazingly horrible " , he nevertheless gave it three stars out of five . 
 The mash @-@ up of " I Love New York " and " New York , New York " was typical of the range of reactions songs received . Benigno gave it a " C " and wondered whether it was bad that he " thought this was a joke song before [ he ] realized it was a mash @-@ up " . Gonzalez gave it a " B " and said it was " not [ her ] favorite " . Futterman called it an " infectious , high @-@ speed mash @-@ up " and Hankinson listed it as one of the four favorite songs from the episode , though Kubicek said the on @-@ screen performance " would make any real New Yorker want to kick [ New Directions ] in the shins " . 
 Most reviewers were highly critical of the inclusion of Morrison 's " Still Got Tonight " , the second single from his solo album . VanDerWerff called it " way too self @-@ indulgent " and Kubicek characterized it as " shameless self promotion " . Gonzalez said the song " isn 't half bad " and gave it a " B − " , while Benigno was more generous with a " B + " , despite his belief that it did not belong in the episode . Futterman called it " a generic @-@ sounding pop melody " . The use of " Bella Notte " , by contrast , was generally approved of , though Kubicek thought it was " kind of weird that they weren 't really there " , and Berk gave both of its two stars out of five solely due to the " spectral singers " . VanDerWerff thought the song was " well @-@ performed " , and Benigno gave it a " B + " ; he had a very different take from Kubicek , as he found the imaginary appearance by the male club members hilarious . 
 Although Kurt and Rachel being allowed on the stage of a Broadway theater was deemed improbable in the extreme by many critics , most were willing to suspend disbelief and enjoy their duet of " For Good " . Futterman wrote that the performance brought events " full circle from their season one drama around singing ' Defying Gravity ' . It 's a fitting song for friendship and Kurt and Rachel nail it . " The Wall Street Journal 's Raymund Flandez described it as " so sublime that it could have fit so easily in the cast version of the musical 's CD " . While Benigno wished the song had started two @-@ voice harmony sooner , he gave it an " A − " and called it " friggin ' lovely " . Among the less favorable comments , VanDerWerff felt that the song itself was " pretty weak " . 
 Usher 's " Yeah ! " by an unnamed all @-@ female a cappella group received variant opinions . Aly Semigran of MTV said that the group " nailed " the song , but Benigno found the track and performers annoying and gave it a " D − " . Futterman noted , " the arrangement feels flat and the dancing is <unk> " , and Hankinson called this song and the Vocal Adrenaline offering , " As Long As You 're There " , " meh " . The latter song also garnered divergent opinions , from Kubicek 's " neither fun nor interesting " to Gonzalez 's award of an " A + " , her best grade of the show . Futterman wrote that Sunshine handled her ballad with " masterful skill and unbelievable ease " . 
 The two original songs sung by New Directions were rated from excellent to abysmal . Benigno gave each song a " B + " ; he called the duet , " Pretending " , " lovely " . The nicest thing Kubicek wrote of it was that it sounded as if the lyrics had been " written by a lovesick teenage boy " , and he called " Light Up the World " a " trainwreck " . Berk was even harsher : " When the show has carte blanche access to every amazing song in the history of popular music , there 's something terribly humiliating about watching the kids sing this shit tune as their finale , and do so with such desperate conviction . " Gonzalez gave " Light Up the World " a " B + " , but said it sounded a " bit too much " like " Loser Like Me " , and while Benigno thought it had a better melody than " Loser " and also made " much better use of the <unk> as a whole " , he criticized the chorus for its similarity to " Let It Rock " by Kevin Rudolf . Semigran said it was an " uplifting , if not rather lackluster pop song " , yet Hankinson called it his favorite number in the episode .

 = USS Saratoga ( CV @-@ 3 ) = 
 USS Saratoga ( CV @-@ 3 ) was a Lexington @-@ class aircraft carrier built for the United States Navy during the 1920s . Originally designed as a battlecruiser , she was converted into one of the Navy 's first aircraft carriers during construction to comply with the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 . The ship entered service in 1928 and was assigned to the Pacific Fleet for her entire career . Saratoga and her sister ship , Lexington , were used to develop and refine carrier tactics in a series of annual exercises before World War II . On more than one occasion these included successful surprise attacks on Pearl Harbor , Hawaii . She was one of three prewar US fleet aircraft carriers , along with Enterprise and Ranger , to serve throughout World War II . 
 Shortly after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor , Saratoga was the centerpiece of the unsuccessful American effort to relieve Wake Island and was torpedoed by a Japanese submarine a few weeks later . After lengthy repairs , the ship supported forces participating in the Guadalcanal Campaign and her aircraft sank the light carrier Ryūjō during the Battle of the Eastern Solomons in August 1942 . She was again torpedoed the following month and returned to the Solomon Islands area after repairs were completed . 
 In 1943 , Saratoga supported Allied forces involved in the New Georgia Campaign and invasion of Bougainville in the northern Solomon Islands and her aircraft twice attacked the Japanese base at Rabaul in November . Early in 1944 , her aircraft provided air support during the Gilbert and Marshall Islands Campaign before she was transferred to the Indian Ocean for several months to support the British Eastern Fleet as it attacked targets in Java and Sumatra . After a brief refit in mid @-@ 1944 , the ship became a training ship for the rest of the year . 
 In early 1945 , Saratoga participated in the Battle of Iwo Jima as a dedicated night fighter carrier . Several days into the battle , she was badly damaged by kamikaze hits and was forced to return to the United States for repairs . While under repair , the ship , now increasingly obsolete , was permanently modified as a training carrier with some of her hangar deck converted into classrooms . Saratoga remained in this role for the rest of the war and was used to ferry troops back to the United States after the Japanese surrender in August . In mid @-@ 1946 , the ship was a target for nuclear weapon tests during Operation Crossroads . She survived the first test with little damage , but was sunk by the second test . 
 = = Design and construction = = 
 Saratoga was the fifth US Navy ship named after the 1777 Battle of Saratoga , an important victory during the Revolutionary War . She was originally authorized in 1916 as a Lexington @-@ class battlecruiser , but construction was placed on hold so that higher @-@ priority anti @-@ submarine vessels and merchant ships , needed to ensure the safe passage of men and materiel to Europe during Germany 's U @-@ boat campaign , could be built . After the war the ship was extensively redesigned to incorporate improved boiler technology , anti @-@ torpedo bulges , and a general increase in armor protection based on British wartime experiences . Given the hull number of CC @-@ 3 , Saratoga was laid down on 25 September 1920 by New York Shipbuilding Corporation of Camden , New Jersey . 
 In February 1922 , before the Washington Naval Conference concluded , the ship 's construction was suspended when she was 28 percent complete . She was ordered to be converted to an aircraft carrier with the hull number CV @-@ 3 on 1 July 1922 . Her displacement was reduced by a total of 4 @,@ 000 long tons ( 4 @,@ 100 t ) , achieved mainly by the elimination of her main armament of eight 16 @-@ inch ( 406 mm ) guns in four twin gun turrets ( including their heavy barbettes , armor , and other equipment ) . The main armor belt was retained , although it was reduced in height to save weight . The hull generally remained unaltered , as did the torpedo protection system , because they had already been built and it would have been too expensive to alter them . 
 The ship had an overall length of 888 feet ( 270 @.@ 7 m ) , a beam of 106 feet ( 32 @.@ 3 m ) , and a draft of 30 feet 5 inches ( 9 @.@ 3 m ) at deep load . Saratoga had a standard displacement of 36 @,@ 000 long tons ( 36 @,@ 578 t ) , and 43 @,@ 055 long tons ( 43 @,@ 746 t ) at deep load . At that displacement , she had a metacentric height of 7 @.@ 31 feet ( 2 @.@ 2 m ) . 
 Christened by Mrs. Curtis D. Wilbur , wife of the Secretary of the Navy , Saratoga was launched on 7 April 1925 and commissioned on 16 November 1927 , under the command of Captain Harry E. Yarnell . She was nicknamed by her crew Sister Sara and , later , Sara Maru . In 1942 , the ship had a crew of 100 officers and 1 @,@ 840 enlisted men , and an aviation group totaling 141 officers and 710 enlisted men . By 1945 , her crew totaled 3 @,@ 373 , including her aviation group . 
 = = = Flight deck arrangements = = = 
 The ship 's flight deck was 866 feet 2 inches ( 264 @.@ 01 m ) long and had a maximum width of 105 feet 11 inches ( 32 @.@ 28 m ) . Her flight deck was widened forward and extended 16 feet ( 4 @.@ 9 m ) aft during her refit in mid @-@ 1941 . When built , her hangar " was the largest single enclosed space afloat on any ship " and had an area of 33 @,@ 528 square feet ( 3 @,@ 114 @.@ 9 m2 ) . It was 424 feet ( 129 @.@ 2 m ) long and no less than 68 feet ( 20 @.@ 7 m ) wide . Its minimum height was 21 feet ( 6 @.@ 4 m ) , and it was divided by a single fire curtain just forward of the aft aircraft elevator . Aircraft repair shops , 108 feet ( 32 @.@ 9 m ) long , were aft of the hangar , and below them was a storage space for disassembled aircraft , 128 feet ( 39 @.@ 0 m ) long . Saratoga was fitted with two hydraulically powered elevators on her centerline . The forward elevator 's dimensions were 30 by 60 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m × 18 @.@ 3 m ) and it had a capacity of 16 @,@ 000 pounds ( 7 @,@ 300 kg ) . The aft elevator had a capacity of only 6 @,@ 000 pounds ( 2 @,@ 700 kg ) and measured 30 by 36 feet ( 9 @.@ 1 m × 11 @.@ 0 m ) . <unk> was stored in eight compartments of the torpedo protection system , and their capacity has been quoted as either 132 @,@ 264 US gallons ( 500 @,@ 670 l ; 110 @,@ 133 imp gal ) or 163 @,@ 000 US gallons ( 620 @,@ 000 l ; 136 @,@ 000 imp gal ) . 
 Saratoga was initially fitted with electrically operated arresting gear designed by Carl Norden that used longitudinal wires intended to prevent the aircraft from being blown over the side of the ship , and transverse wires to slow the aircraft to a stop . This system was authorized to be replaced by the hydraulically operated Mk 2 system , without longitudinal wires , on 11 August 1931 . Four improved Mk 3 units were added in 1934 , giving the ship a total of eight arresting wires and four barriers intended to prevent aircraft from crashing into parked aircraft on the ship 's bow . When the forward flight deck was widened , an additional eight wires were added there to allow aircraft to land over the bow if the landing area at the stern was damaged . The ship was built with a 155 @-@ foot ( 47 @.@ 2 m ) , flywheel @-@ powered , F Mk II aircraft catapult , also designed by Norden , on the starboard side of the bow . This catapult was strong enough to launch a 10 @,@ 000 @-@ pound ( 4 @,@ 500 kg ) aircraft at a speed of 48 knots ( 89 km / h ; 55 mph ) . It was intended to launch seaplanes , but was rarely used ; a 1931 report counted only five launches of practice loads since the ship had been commissioned . It was removed some time after 1936 . 
 Relatively few changes were made during the war to Saratoga 's aircraft @-@ handling equipment . Her crew removed her forward arresting wires in late 1943 , although their hydraulic systems were not removed until her refit in mid @-@ 1944 . At that time she received two Type H hydraulic catapults mounted in her forward flight deck to handle the heavier aircraft entering service . Before the war , plans were made to replace the aft elevator with a 44 @-@ by @-@ 48 @-@ foot ( 13 @.@ 4 m × 14 @.@ 6 m ) model , but manufacturing delays and operational demands prevented this from ever happening . By mid @-@ 1942 , the increasing size and weight of naval aircraft exceeded the capacity of the aft elevator and it was locked in place . It was removed in March 1945 to save weight and the opening in the flight deck was plated over . The machinery for the forward elevator was scheduled to be upgraded before the war , but this was not done until mid @-@ 1944 . A new , 44 @-@ by @-@ 48 @-@ foot lightweight forward elevator identical to those used in the Essex @-@ class carriers was installed in March 1945 . 
 Saratoga was designed to carry 78 aircraft of various types , including 36 bombers , but these numbers increased once the Navy adopted the practice of tying up spare aircraft in the unused spaces at the top of the hangar . In 1936 , her air group consisted of 18 Grumman F2F @-@ 1 and 18 Boeing F4B @-@ 4 fighters , plus an additional nine F2Fs in reserve . Offensive punch was provided by 20 Vought SBU Corsair dive bombers with 10 spare aircraft and 18 Great Lakes BG torpedo bombers with nine spares . Miscellaneous aircraft included two Grumman JF Duck amphibians , plus one in reserve , and three active and one spare Vought O2U Corsair observation aircraft . This amounted to 79 aircraft , plus 30 spares . In early 1945 , the ship carried 53 Grumman F6F Hellcat fighters and 17 Grumman TBF Avenger torpedo bombers . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 The Lexington @-@ class carriers used turbo @-@ electric propulsion ; each of the four propeller shafts was driven by two 22 @,@ 500 @-@ shaft @-@ horsepower ( 16 @,@ 800 kW ) electric motors . They were powered by four General Electric turbo generators rated at 35 @,@ 200 kilowatts ( 47 @,@ 200 hp ) . Steam for the generators was provided by sixteen Yarrow boilers , each in its own individual compartment . Six 750 @-@ kilowatt ( 1 @,@ 010 hp ) electric generators were installed in the upper levels of the two main turbine compartments to provide power to meet the ship 's hotel load ( minimum electrical ) requirements . 
 The ship was designed to reach 33 @.@ 25 knots ( 61 @.@ 58 km / h ; 38 @.@ 26 mph ) , but Lexington achieved 34 @.@ 59 knots ( 64 @.@ 06 km / h ; 39 @.@ 81 mph ) from 202 @,@ 973 shp ( 151 @,@ 357 kW ) during sea trials in 1928 . She carried a maximum of 6 @,@ 688 long tons ( 6 @,@ 795 t ) of fuel oil , but only 5 @,@ 400 long tons ( 5 @,@ 500 t ) of that was usable , as the rest had to be retained as ballast in the port fuel tanks to offset the weight of the island and main guns . Designed for a range of 10 @,@ 000 nautical miles ( 19 @,@ 000 km ; 12 @,@ 000 mi ) at a speed of 10 knots ( 19 km / h ; 12 mph ) , the ship demonstrated a range of 9 @,@ 910 nmi ( 18 @,@ 350 km ; 11 @,@ 400 mi ) at a speed of 10 @.@ 7 knots ( 19 @.@ 8 km / h ; 12 @.@ 3 mph ) with 4 @,@ 540 long tons ( 4 @,@ 610 t ) of oil . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 The Navy 's Bureau of Construction and Repair was not convinced when the class was being designed that aircraft could effectively substitute as armament for a warship , especially at night or in bad weather that would prevent air operations . Thus the carriers ' design included a substantial gun battery of eight 55 @-@ caliber Mk 9 eight @-@ inch guns in four twin gun turrets . These turrets were mounted above the flight deck on the starboard side , two before the superstructure , and two behind the funnel , numbered I to IV from bow to stern . In theory the guns could fire to both sides , but it is probable that firing them to port would have damaged the flight deck . They could be depressed to − 5 ° and elevated to + 41 ° . 
 The ship 's heavy anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) armament consisted of twelve 25 @-@ caliber Mk 10 five @-@ inch guns which were mounted on single mounts , three each fitted on sponsons on each side of the bow and stern . No light AA guns were initially mounted on Saratoga , but two twin .50 @-@ caliber ( 12 @.@ 7 mm ) machine gun mounts were installed in 1929 . They were unsuccessful , but only the mount on the roof of Turret II was replaced by two .50 @-@ caliber ( 12 @.@ 7 mm ) machine guns by 1934 . During the ship 's August 1941 overhaul , four 50 @-@ caliber Mk 10 three @-@ inch AA guns were installed in the corner platforms . Another three @-@ inch gun was added on the roof of the deckhouse between the funnel and the island . In addition , a number of .50 @-@ caliber machine guns were added on platforms mounted on her superstructure . The three @-@ inch guns were just interim weapons until the quadruple 1 @.@ 1 @-@ inch gun mount could be fielded , which occurred during a brief refit at the Bremerton Navy Yard in late November 1941 . 
 While receiving temporary repairs at Pearl Harbor in January 1942 , Saratoga 's eight @-@ inch turrets , barbettes and ammunition hoists were removed ; they were replaced by four twin 38 @-@ caliber five @-@ inch dual @-@ purpose gun mounts in February at Bremerton . New barbettes were built and the ammunition hoists had to be returned from Pearl Harbor . The older 25 @-@ caliber five @-@ inch guns were replaced at the same time by eight more dual @-@ purpose guns in single mounts . As the new guns were heavier than the older ones , only two could be added to the corner gun platforms ; the space formerly used by the third gun on each platform was used by an additional quadruple 1 @.@ 1 @-@ inch mount . In addition 32 Oerlikon 20 mm cannon were installed , six at the base of the funnel and the others distributed along the sides and rear of the flight deck . When the ship 's repairs were completed in late May , her armament consisted of 16 five @-@ inch guns , nine quadruple 1 @.@ 1 @-@ inch gun mounts and 32 Oerlikon 20 @-@ millimeter ( 0 @.@ 79 in ) guns . 
 After the ship was again torpedoed in August 1942 , her 1 @.@ 1 @-@ inch gun mounts were replaced by an equal number of quadruple Bofors 40 mm mounts while she was under repair at Pearl Harbor . Her light anti @-@ aircraft armament was also increased to 52 Oerlikon guns at the same time . In January 1944 a number of her 20 mm guns were replaced by more Bofors guns , many of which were in the positions formerly occupied by the ship 's boats in the sides of the hull . Saratoga mounted 23 quadruple and two twin 40 mm mountings as well as 16 Oerlikon guns when she completed her refit . 
 = = = Fire control and electronics = = = 
 The two superfiring eight @-@ inch turrets had a Mk 30 rangefinder at the rear of the turret for local control , but the guns were normally controlled by two Mk 18 fire @-@ control directors , one each on the fore and aft spotting tops . A 20 @-@ foot ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) rangefinder was fitted on top of the pilothouse to provide range information for the directors . Each group of three 5 @-@ inch guns was controlled by a Mk 19 director , two of which were mounted on each side of the spotting tops . Plans were made before the war to replace the obsolete Mk 19 directors with two heavier Mk 33 directors , one each on the fore and aft five @-@ inch spotting tops , but these plans were cancelled when the dual @-@ purpose guns replaced the main armament in early 1942 . 
 Saratoga received a RCA CXAM @-@ 1 early warning radar in February 1941 during a refit in Bremerton . The antenna was mounted on the forward lip of the funnel with its control room directly below the aerial , replacing the secondary conning station formerly mounted there . She also received two FC ( Mk 3 ) surface fire @-@ control radars in late 1941 , although these were both removed along with her main armament in January 1942 . The new dual @-@ purpose guns were controlled by two Mk 37 directors , each mounting an FD ( Mk 4 ) anti @-@ aircraft gunnery radar . When the 1 @.@ 1 @-@ inch guns were replaced by 40 mm guns in 1942 , the directors for the smaller guns were replaced by five Mk 51 directors . A small SC @-@ 1 early warning radar was mounted on the rear lip of the funnel during 1942 . A SG surface @-@ search radar was mounted on the foremast at the same time . 
 During the ship 's refit in January 1944 , her electronics were modernized . The CXAM was replaced by an SK model and the SC @-@ 1 was replaced by an SC @-@ 3 . The forward SG was supplemented by an additional SG @-@ 1 mounted on a short mast at the aft end of the funnel . A lengthier overhaul in mid @-@ 1944 provided the opportunity to revise the radar arrangements . The SK radar was moved to the rebuilt foremast and the forward SG radar was replaced by an SG @-@ 1 mounted at the top of the foremast . An SM @-@ 1 fighter @-@ control radar was mounted in the SK 's former position and new antennas were added to the FD radars to allow them to determine target height . The SC @-@ 3 was replaced by an SC @-@ 4 in early 1945 .

 The waterline belt of the Lexington @-@ class ships tapered 7 – 5 inches ( 178 – 127 mm ) in thickness from top to bottom and angled 11 ° outwards at the top . It covered the middle 530 feet ( 161 @.@ 5 m ) of the ships . Forward , the belt ended in a bulkhead that also tapered from seven to five inches in thickness . Aft , it terminated at a seven @-@ inch bulkhead . This belt had a height of 9 feet 4 inches ( 2 @.@ 8 m ) . The third deck over the ships ' machinery and magazine was armored with two layers of special treatment steel ( STS ) totaling 2 inches ( 51 mm ) in thickness ; the steering gear was protected by two layers of STS that totaled 3 inches ( 76 mm ) on the flat and 4 @.@ 5 inches ( 114 mm ) on the slope . 
 The gun turrets were protected only against splinters with .75 inches ( 19 mm ) of armor . The conning tower was armored with 2 – 2 @.@ 25 inches ( 51 – 57 mm ) of STS , and it had a communications tube with two @-@ inch sides running from the conning tower down to the lower conning position on the third deck . The torpedo defense system of the Lexington @-@ class ships consisted of three to six medium steel protective bulkheads that ranged from .375 to .75 inches ( 10 to 19 mm ) in thickness . The spaces between them could be used as fuel tanks or left empty to absorb the detonation of a torpedo 's warhead .

 While under repair after being torpedoed in January 1942 , Saratoga received a 7 @-@ foot @-@ 2 @-@ inch ( 2 @.@ 2 m ) bulge on the starboard side of her hull . This was primarily intended to increase the ship 's buoyancy , improve stability and allow her full fuel capacity to be utilized . The bulge was estimated to increase her metacentric height by 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 9 m ) and decrease her speed by one @-@ quarter of a knot . It was also used to store additional fuel oil and increased her capacity to a total of 9 @,@ 748 long tons ( 9 @,@ 904 t ) . At the same time , her funnel was shortened by 20 feet ( 6 @.@ 1 m ) and her tripod foremast was replaced by a light pole mast to reduce her topweight . 
 All of these changes , including the lengthening of the flight deck , increased Saratoga 's full @-@ load displacement in 1945 to 49 @,@ 552 long tons ( 50 @,@ 347 t ) . Her overall length increased to 909 @.@ 45 feet ( 277 @.@ 2 m ) and her beam , at the waterline , to 111 feet 9 inches ( 34 @.@ 1 m ) , too wide to use the Panama Canal .

 Saratoga was commissioned one month earlier than her sister ship , Lexington . As the ship was visually identical to Lexington , her funnel was painted with a large black vertical stripe to help pilots recognize her . She began her shakedown cruise on 6 January 1928 and five days later Marc A. Mitscher landed the first aircraft on board . Later that month , the rigid airship Los Angeles was refueled and resupplied when she moored to Saratoga 's stern on 27 January . That same day , the ship sailed for the Pacific via the Panama Canal , although she was diverted briefly en route to carry Marines to Corinto , Nicaragua , before joining the Battle Fleet at San Pedro , California , on 21 February . On 15 September , Captain John Halligan , Jr. relieved the newly promoted Rear Admiral Yarnell . 
 In January 1929 , Saratoga participated in her first fleet exercise , Fleet Problem IX , a simulated attack on the Panama Canal . These exercises tested the Navy 's evolving doctrine and tactics for the use of carriers . The ship was detached from the fleet with only the light cruiser Omaha as escort and made a wide sweep to the south to attack the canal , which was defended by the Scouting Fleet and Lexington , from an unexpected direction . Although the carrier was spotted by two defending ships before she launched her air strike , her aircraft were deemed to have destroyed the canal locks . Saratoga was " sunk " later the same day by an airstrike from Lexington . Captain Frederick J. Horne assumed command on 20 April . The following year , Saratoga and Langley were " disabled " by a surprise attack from Lexington in Fleet Problem X in the Caribbean . Saratoga returned the favor shortly afterward in Fleet Problem XI , further demonstrating the vulnerability of carriers to aerial attack . Following the exercises , Saratoga participated in the Presidential Review at Norfolk , Virginia in May and then returned to San Pedro . Captain Frank McCrary relieved Horne on 5 September 1930 . 
 Saratoga was assigned , together with Lexington , to defend the west coast of Panama against a hypothetical invader during Fleet Problem XII in February 1931 . While each carrier was able to inflict some damage on the invasion convoys , the enemy forces succeeded in making a landing . All three carriers then transferred to the Caribbean to conduct further maneuvers , including one in which Saratoga successfully defended the Caribbean side of the Panama Canal from a staged attack by Lexington . Rear Admiral Joseph M. Reeves baited a trap for Lexington 's captain , Ernest J. King , with a destroyer and scored a kill on Lexington on 22 March while the latter 's aircraft were still searching for Saratoga . The 1932 movie Hell Divers was filmed aboard the ship and starred Wallace Beery and a young Clark Gable as a pair of competing aircraft gunners assigned to VF @-@ 1B . 
 During Grand Joint Exercise No. 4 , Saratoga and Lexington were able to launch an airstrike against Pearl Harbor on Sunday , 7 February 1932 , without being detected . The two carriers were separated for Fleet Problem XIII which followed shortly afterward . Blue Fleet and Saratoga were tasked to attack Hawaii and the West Coast defended by Lexington and the Black Fleet . On 15 March , Lexington caught Saratoga with all of her planes still on deck and was ruled to have knocked out her flight deck and have badly damaged the carrier , which was subsequently judged sunk during a night attack by Black Fleet destroyers . Captain George W. Steele assumed command on 11 July 1932 . While en route from San Diego to San Pedro , the ship briefly ran aground off Sunset Beach , California on 17 August . Captain Rufus F. <unk> , Jr . ( son of the famous illustrator ) relieved Steele , who was ordered to immediately retire , on 1 January 1933 . 
 Before Fleet Problem XIV began the following month , the Army and the Navy conducted a joint exercise simulating a carrier attack on Hawaii . Lexington and Saratoga successfully attacked Pearl Harbor at dawn on 31 January without being detected . During the actual fleet problem , the ship successfully attacked targets in and around Los Angeles and San Francisco although she was damaged by opposing ships during the latter attack . Scenes from the 1933 Joe E. Brown film comedy Son of a Sailor were filmed aboard Saratoga and featured flight deck musters of the ships ' company . Fleet Problem XV returned to the Gulf of Panama and the Caribbean in April – May 1934 ; the participating ships of the Pacific Fleet remained in the Caribbean and off the East Coast for more training and maneuvers until they returned to their home bases in November . Captain Kenneth Whiting relieved <unk> on 12 June , after the conclusion of the fleet problem . 
 Captain William F. Halsey assumed command on 6 July 1935 after the conclusion of Fleet Problem XVI . From 27 April to 6 June 1936 , she participated in a Fleet Problem in the Panama Canal Zone where she was " sunk " by opposing battlecruisers and later ruled to have been severely damaged by aircraft from Ranger . During Fleet Problem XVIII in 1937 , Saratoga , now under the command of naval aviation pioneer John H. Towers , covered an amphibious assault on Midway Atoll and was badly " damaged " by Ranger 's aircraft . 
 The 1938 Fleet Problem again tested the defenses of Hawaii and , again , aircraft from Saratoga and her sister successfully attacked Pearl Harbor at dawn on 29 March . Later in the exercise , the two carriers successfully attacked San Francisco without being spotted by the defending fleet . Captain Albert Cushing Read relieved Towers in July 1938 . During Fleet Problem XX in 1939 , the carrier remained off the West Coast as part of Task Force ( TF ) 7 with the battleship Arizona and escorts under the command of Rear Admiral Chester Nimitz to maintain a presence in the Pacific . From 2 April to 21 June 1940 , she participated in Fleet Problem XXI , and her aircraft , together with those from Lexington , " damaged " the carrier Yorktown in an early phase of the exercise . 
 From 6 January to 15 August 1941 , Saratoga underwent a long @-@ deferred modernization at the Bremerton Navy Yard that included the widening of her flight deck at her bow and the installation of additional antiaircraft guns and a CXAM @-@ 1 radar . The ship began a refit a few days later that lasted until late November , further revising the anti @-@ aircraft armament and added a FC radar .

 When the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on 7 December 1941 , Saratoga was entering San Diego Harbor to embark her air group , which had been training ashore while the ship was refitting . This consisted of 11 Grumman F4F @-@ 3 Wildcat fighters of VF @-@ 3 ( under the command of Lieutenant Jimmy Thach ) , 43 Douglas SBD Dauntless dive bombers of VB @-@ 3 and VS @-@ 3 , and 11 Douglas TBD Devastator torpedo bombers of VT @-@ 3 . The ship also was under orders to load 14 Marine Corps Brewster F2A @-@ 3 Buffalo fighters of VMF @-@ 221 for delivery in Oahu . The following morning the ship , now the flagship of Carrier Division One , commanded by Rear Admiral Aubrey Fitch , sailed for Pearl Harbor . Saratoga arrived at Pearl on 15 December , refueled , and departed for Wake Island the following day . The ship was assigned to Task Force ( TF ) 14 under the command of Rear Admiral Frank Jack Fletcher ; VF @-@ 3 had been reinforced by two additional Wildcats picked up in Hawaii , but one SBD had been forced to ditch on 11 December . 
 She then rendezvoused with the seaplane tender Tangier , carrying reinforcements and supplies , and the slow replenishment oiler Neches . Saratoga 's task force was delayed by the necessity to refuel its escorting destroyers on 21 December , before reaching the island . This process was prolonged by heavy weather , although the task force could still reach Wake by 24 December as scheduled . After receiving reports of heavy Japanese carrier airstrikes , and then troop landings , TF 14 was recalled on 23 December , and Wake fell the same day . On the return voyage , Saratoga delivered VMF @-@ 221 to Midway on 25 December . The ship arrived at Pearl on 29 December and Fletcher was replaced as commander of Task Force 14 by Rear Admiral Herbert F. Leary the following day . Leary made Saratoga his flagship and Fitch was transferred to a shore command that same day . The task force put to sea on 31 December and patrolled in the vicinity of Midway . 
 Saratoga , about 420 nautical miles ( 780 km ; 480 mi ) southwest of Pearl Harbor on 11 January 1942 , was heading towards a rendezvous with USS Enterprise when she was hit by a torpedo fired by the I @-@ 6 . The explosion flooded three of her boiler rooms , reduced her speed to a maximum of 16 knots ( 30 km / h ; 18 mph ) and killed six of her crewmen . The ship 's list was soon corrected and she reached Pearl two days later . While undergoing temporary repairs there , her four twin eight @-@ inch gun turrets were removed for installation in shore batteries on Oahu . Saratoga then sailed to the Bremerton Navy Yard on 9 February for permanent repairs . She embarked 10 Wildcats of the VF @-@ 2 Detachment and all of VS @-@ 3 with its Dauntlesses for self @-@ protection on the voyage . 
 While under repair , the ship was modernized with an anti @-@ torpedo bulge , her anti @-@ aircraft armament was significantly upgraded and more radars were added . Douglas was relieved on 12 April and Saratoga was temporarily commanded by her executive officer , Commander Alfred M. Pride , until Captain DeWitt Ramsey assumed command a month later . Saratoga departed from Bremerton on 22 May , bound for San Diego . She arrived there on 25 May and began loading aircraft and supplies while waiting for her task force commander , Admiral Fitch , to arrive from the South Pacific . On 30 May Admiral Nimitz , now commander @-@ in @-@ chief of the United States Pacific Fleet , ordered Captain Ramsey to expedite his departure for Pearl Harbor , even if Fitch had not yet arrived . The ship sailed from San Diego on 1 June carrying 14 Wildcats of VF @-@ 2 Detachment and 23 Dauntlesses of VS @-@ 3 ; in addition she carried four Wildcats , 43 Dauntlesses and 14 Avengers as cargo . She arrived at Pearl Harbor on 6 June , the final day of the Battle of Midway . After refuelling , Saratoga departed the following day with the mission to ferry replacement aircraft to the carriers that survived the battle . The ship carried a total of 47 Wildcats , 45 Dauntlesses , five Devastators and 10 Avengers , including her own air group . Admiral Fletcher ( whose flagship Yorktown had been sunk during the battle ) came aboard on 8 June and made Saratoga his flagship . The ship rendezvoused with the other carriers on 11 June and transferred 19 Dauntlesses , the five Devastators and all of the Avengers to them . When the ship reached Pearl on 13 June , Fletcher and his staff disembarked ; Admiral Fitch rendezvoused with the ship the next day . He became commander of Task Force 11 on 15 June , when Nimitz reorganized his carriers . From 22 through 29 June , Saratoga ferried 18 Marine Dauntlesses of VMSB @-@ 231 and 25 Army Air Corps Curtiss P @-@ 40 Warhawks to Midway Island to replace the aircraft lost during the battle . Fletcher relieved Fitch as commander of TF 11 the following day . 
 = = = = Guadalcanal campaign = = = = 
 In late June 1942 , the Allies decided to seize bases in the southern Solomon Islands with the objective of denying their use by the Japanese to threaten the supply and communication routes between the U.S. , Australia , and New Zealand . They also intended to use Guadalcanal and Tulagi as bases to support a campaign to eventually capture or neutralize the major Japanese base at Rabaul on New Britain . Admiral Nimitz committed much of the Pacific Fleet to the task , including three of his four carrier task forces . They fell under the command of the recently appointed Vice Admiral Robert L. Ghormley , commander of the South Pacific Area . 
 On 7 July , Task Force 11 departed Pearl for the Southwest Pacific ; it consisted of Saratoga , four heavy cruisers , Astoria , New Orleans , Minneapolis and Vincennes , and was escorted by seven destroyers . Also assigned were three replenishment oilers and four fast transports converted from old four @-@ stack destroyers . The carrier embarked 90 aircraft , comprising 37 Wildcats , 37 Dauntlesses and 16 Avengers . TF 11 and TF 18 , centered around the carrier Wasp , rendezvoused south of Tongatapu on 24 July and they met the remaining forces , including Enterprise 's TF 16 , assigned to Operation Watchtower three days later south of the Fiji Islands . The entire force of 82 ships was organized as Task Force 61 and commanded by Fletcher . On 30 July , Saratoga and the other carriers provided air cover for amphibious landings on Koro Island and practiced air strikes as part of the rehearsals for the planned invasion of Guadalcanal , Tulagi , and nearby islands . 
 The Allied force successfully reached the Solomon Islands without being detected by the Japanese because of thick fog and haze . Saratoga launched 24 Dauntlesses and a dozen Wildcats early on 7 August to attack targets on Guadalcanal . Her air group commander , Commander Harry D. Felt , coordinated the attack over the island , which also included eight Wildcats from Enterprise 's VF @-@ 6 . The aircraft focused on the nearly complete airfield at Lunga and dispersed the two construction battalions building it . This allowed the 1st Marine Division to capture it ( renaming it Henderson Field ) without resistance . For the rest of the day , the carriers provided a combat air patrol ( CAP ) over the transports and themselves while their other aircraft provided air support for the Marines as needed . 
 The Japanese struck back quickly and launched 27 Mitsubishi G4M ( " Betty " ) medium bombers , escorted by 17 Mitsubishi A6M Zero ( " Zeke " ) fighters , against the Allied forces . Among the escorting pilots were several aces such as Tadashi Nakajima , Hiroyoshi Nishizawa , and Saburō Sakai . Failing to spot the carriers , the bombers attacked the transports and their escorts , defended by eight Wildcats from Saratoga 's VF @-@ 5 . The Zeros shot down five Wildcats without losing any of their own , but the Americans shot down at least one G4M and damaged a number of others . The bombers failed to hit any Allied ships . About an hour later , nine Aichi D3A ( " Val " ) dive bombers attacked the transport groups . Also based in Rabaul , they were on a one @-@ way mission with a minimal payload of two small 60 @-@ kilogram ( 132 lb ) bombs each because the distance to Guadalcanal exceeded their combat range ; the pilots were expected to ditch at Shortland Island on the return leg where a Japanese seaplane tender could pick them up . By the time they arrived , the American CAP had been reinforced to 15 Wildcats from VF @-@ 5 and VF @-@ 6 . Realizing that they had been spotted and that they could not reach the vulnerable transports before they were intercepted by the defending fighters , the Japanese attacked two of the escorting destroyers . They lightly damaged one destroyer with a direct hit , but the Americans shot down five of the attackers without loss to themselves . 
 The Japanese attacked the transports again the following day , but none of Saratoga 's aircraft were involved . Concerned about his declining fuel reserves and worried about air and submarine attacks after losing 20 % of his fighters , Fletcher requested permission from Ghormley to withdraw one day early to refuel . This was granted and Fletcher 's carriers were mostly out of range by the morning of 9 August . This meant that the transports lacked air cover , but the only Japanese airstrike of the day specifically targeted the carriers and ignored the transports entirely . Fletcher loitered southeast of the Solomons , waiting for the Japanese carriers that signals intelligence told him were en route to be spotted . He rendezvoused with the aircraft transport Long Island on 19 August and covered her approach to Guadalcanal . The ship was carrying Marine aircraft for Henderson Field and successfully flew them off the next day . Fletcher returned to the Solomons on 21 August after escorting Long Island to safety and remained in the vicinity for the next several days to provide cover for two transports resupplying the Marines . American aircraft shot down several Japanese reconnaissance aircraft during this time and the Japanese concluded that one or more American carriers were operating southeast of Guadalcanal . 
 = = = = = Battle of the Eastern Solomons = = = = = 
 The presence of American carriers nearby firmed up Japanese plans to land troops on Guadalcanal on 24 August , covered by the fleet carriers Shōkaku and Zuikaku and the light carrier Ryūjō . A force of Japanese troop transports was detected on the morning of 23 August some 300 nautical miles ( 560 km ; 350 mi ) north of Guadalcanal . Fletcher was not originally inclined to attack them until another force of two transports was spotted at <unk> later that morning . He changed his mind and ordered Saratoga to launch her airstrike of 31 Dauntlesses and six Avengers in the early afternoon at very long range . They could not locate the Japanese convoy in poor visibility because it had reversed course shortly after spotting the American reconnaissance aircraft . The aircraft lacked the range to return to their carrier and they were ordered to land at Henderson Field and return the following morning . 
 The Japanese failed to locate the American carriers during the day and Vice Admiral Chūichi Nagumo , commander of the First Carrier Division , ordered Ryūjō , escorted by the heavy cruiser Tone and two destroyers , to attack Henderson Field , as per Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto 's orders . American aircraft located the Ryūjō task force the following morning as it approached within aircraft range of Guadalcanal , as well as other enemy ships , but failed to spot the fleet carriers . Fletcher delayed his attack until further reconnaissance aircraft failed to find the other Japanese carriers and his own aircraft returned from Henderson Field . In the meantime , Ryūjō had launched her own airstrike against Henderson Field , although they inflicted little damage while losing seven out of 21 aircraft during the attack . 
 Saratoga launched an airstrike against Ryūjō 's task force in the early afternoon that consisted of 31 Dauntlesses and eight Avengers ; the long range precluded fighter escort . While those aircraft were en route , a number of reconnaissance aircraft from Enterprise spotted and attacked the Japanese formation . They inflicted no damage and the Japanese CAP shot down one Avenger . Saratoga 's aircraft sighted the carrier shortly afterward and attacked . They hit Ryūjō three times with 1 @,@ 000 @-@ pound ( 450 kg ) bombs and one torpedo ; the torpedo hit flooded the starboard engine and boiler rooms . No aircraft from either Ryūjō or Saratoga were shot down in the attack . The carrier capsized about four hours later with the loss of 120 crewmen . 
 About an hour after Saratoga launched her airstrike , the Japanese launched theirs once they located the American carriers . Shōkaku contributed 18 D3As and nine Zeros while Zuikaku launched nine D3As and six Zeros . Reconnaissance SBDs from Enterprise spotted the 1st Carrier Division shortly after the Japanese airstrike had taken off and five of Shōkaku 's Zeros stayed behind to deal with the Dauntlesses as they attacked Shōkaku . The Dauntlesses survived the attack by the Zeros , but their spot report was garbled and the enemy 's location could not be understood . This incident prompted Nagumo to launch a follow @-@ on airstrike with 27 D3As and nine Zeros . 
 The first airstrike attacked the ships of TF 16 which was initially defended by fighters from VF @-@ 6 . Once radar spotted the incoming Japanese aircraft , both carriers launched all available fighters . Enterprise was badly damaged by three bomb hits , but the Japanese lost 19 dive bombers and four Zeros to the defending fighters and anti @-@ aircraft fire . They claimed to have shot down a dozen Wildcats although the Americans lost only five , of which two belonged to VF @-@ 5 ; some of the American losses were reportedly due to friendly anti @-@ aircraft fire . In turn , the American fighters claimed to have shot down 52 Japanese aircraft , 15 more than the Japanese committed to the attack . The second Japanese airstrike failed to locate the American carriers . 
 Right before the Japanese attack , Saratoga launched a small airstrike of two Dauntlesses and five Avengers to clear her flight deck and these planes found and damaged the seaplane tender Chitose with near misses that also destroyed three Mitsubishi F1M reconnaissance floatplanes . Two Avengers were forced to make emergency landings , but they shot down one Zero from Shōkaku . After recovering their returning aircraft , the two American carriers withdrew , Enterprise for repairs and Saratoga to refuel the next day . Before the former departed for Tongatapu for temporary repairs , she transferred 17 Wildcats and six Avengers to Saratoga as replacements for the latter 's losses . 
 Fletcher rendezvoused with TF 18 east of San Cristobal on the evening of 26 August and transferred four Wildcats to Wasp the next day to bring the latter 's fighters up to strength . TF 17 , with the carrier Hornet , arrived on 29 August . Two days later , a torpedo from I @-@ 26 struck Saratoga on her starboard side , just aft of the island . The torpedo wounded a dozen of her sailors , including Fletcher , and it flooded one fireroom , giving the ship a 4 ° list , but it caused multiple electrical short circuits . These damaged Saratoga 's turbo @-@ electric propulsion system and left her dead in the water for a time . The heavy cruiser Minneapolis took Saratoga in tow while she launched her aircraft for Espiritu Santo , retaining 36 fighters aboard . By noon , the list had been corrected and she was able to steam under her own power later that afternoon . 
 Saratoga reached Tongatapu on 6 September and flew off 27 Wildcats for Efate once she arrived . The ship received temporary repairs there and sailed for Pearl on 12 September , escorted by the battleship South Dakota , New Orleans and five destroyers . Task Force 11 reached Pearl on 21 September and Saratoga entered drydock the following day for more permanent repairs . Captain Ramsey was promoted on 27 September and replaced by Captain Gerald F. Bogan . 
 Task Force 11 , now commanded by Rear Admiral Ramsey , sailed from Pearl Harbor , bound for Nouméa , New Caledonia , via Viti Levu , Fiji , on 12 November 1942 with Saratoga as his flagship . The other ships of the task force consisted of New Orleans , the fleet oiler Kankakee and six destroyers . The carrier had on board the Wildcats of VF @-@ 6 , Dauntlesses of VB @-@ 3 and VS @-@ 6 , and the Avengers of VT @-@ 3 . The ships dropped anchor in Fiji on 22 November , except for New Orleans , which immediately left for Nouméa , escorted by two destroyers . The cruiser was replaced by the light anti @-@ aircraft cruiser San Juan on 29 November and the task force sailed for Nouméa on 1 December . After they arrived on 5 December , one of Saratoga 's main turbines required repairs which lasted until 13 December . 
 = = = = 1943 = = = = 
 On 23 January 1943 , Saratoga launched 18 Wildcats of VF @-@ 3 , 24 Dauntlesses of VB @-@ 3 and VS @-@ 3 , and 17 Avengers of VT @-@ 3 for Henderson Field , retaining 16 Wildcats and 15 Dauntlesses for self @-@ defense . The next day they attacked the Japanese airfield at Vila , Solomon Islands after it had been bombarded by four Allied light cruisers . The aircraft returned to the carrier without loss later that afternoon . Captain Bogan slipped and badly injured himself on 29 March so Captain Henry M. <unk> assumed command on 7 April . 
 With the withdrawal of Enterprise in early May , Saratoga became the only operational American fleet carrier in the South Pacific . Task Force 14 , as her group was now known , was reinforced by the anti @-@ aircraft cruiser San Diego on 3 May and by the British fleet carrier Victorious on 17 May . At this time Saratoga embarked 34 Wildcats of VF @-@ 5 , 37 Dauntlesses of VB @-@ 3 and VS @-@ 3 and 16 Avengers of VT @-@ 8 . Ramsey 's force was intended to provide distant cover for the impending landings on New Georgia and to prevent intervention by any Japanese carriers . The two carriers spent some weeks familiarizing each other with their capabilities and tactics and Ramsey decided to take advantage of each carrier 's strengths . He ordered that the Avengers of 832 Squadron be exchanged for 24 Wildcats from VF @-@ 3 as Victorious had difficulty operating the large Avenger and the British carrier possessed better facilities for coordinating fighter operations than Saratoga ; the latter retained a dozen Wildcats for self @-@ defense and escort duties . Fortunately , Ramsey never got a chance to test his reorganization as the Japanese carriers made no effort to attack the American transports . Ramsey was relieved on 26 July and replaced by Rear Admiral Frederick C. Sherman . Victorious sailed on 31 July for home and left eleven Avengers behind as reserves for Saratoga . 
 Carrier Air Group 12 was assigned to Saratoga in lieu of Carrier Air Group 3 and flew aboard on 1 August . It was composed of VF @-@ 12 , VB @-@ 12 and VT @-@ 12 ; the fighter and dive bomber squadrons each had 36 aircraft and the torpedo bomber squadron had half that number . Grumman F6F Hellcats replaced the Wildcats formerly used . The task force was redesignated as Task Force 38 on 4 August and Captain John H. Cassady relieved <unk> on 22 August after the latter was promoted . The ship was based at <unk> Harbor , Efate and Espiritu Santo from August through November . While refueling at sea on the night of 12 October , Saratoga collided with the oiler Atascosa , damaging three of her 20 @-@ millimeter guns on her port side . On 22 October , she was joined by the light aircraft carrier Princeton . 
 On 27 October , Task Force 38 provided air cover for the invasion of the Treasury Islands , part of the preliminary operations for the invasion of Bougainville Island scheduled a few days later . On the morning of 1 November , Saratoga 's aircraft neutralized Japanese airfields at the northern end of the island and on Buka Island . They destroyed 15 Japanese aircraft while losing three Hellcats , one Dauntless , and two Avengers to all causes . While the task force was refuelling on 3 – 4 November , reconnaissance aircraft discovered Japanese cruisers massing at Rabaul and Admiral Halsey ordered Task Force 38 to attack them with maximal force before they could engage the transports at Bougainville . This translated into an attack group of 23 Avengers and 22 Dauntlesses , escorted by every available fighter on board the two carriers on 5 November ; CAP over the carriers was provided by fighters flying from New Georgia . The attack caught the Japanese by surprise and badly damaged four heavy cruisers , two light cruisers , and a destroyer for the loss of only nine aircraft to all causes . 
 Saratoga and Princeton attacked Rabaul again on 11 November in conjunction with three carriers of Task Group 50 @.@ 3 . They attacked first , but inflicted little damage due to poor visibility ; the other carriers were more successful and further damaged the ships at Rabaul . Task Force 38 returned to Espiritu Santo on 14 November . Now known as Task Group 50 @.@ 4 , Saratoga and Princeton were tasked as the Relief Carrier Group for the offensive in the Gilbert Islands . As part of the preliminary operations , they attacked Nauru on 19 November , destroying two fighters and three G4Ms on the ground . As the carriers were withdrawing , they were unsuccessfully attacked by eight more G4Ms , shooting down half of their attackers . TF 50 @.@ 2 was not attacked during the battle and Saratoga transferred a number of her aircraft to replace losses aboard the other carriers before departing for Pearl Harbor on 30 November . She arrived on 4 December and off @-@ loaded her aircraft and stores before proceeding to San Francisco where she arrived on 9 December for a refit and augmentation of her anti @-@ aircraft guns . 
 = = = = 1944 = = = = 
 Saratoga 's refit was completed on 2 January 1944 and she arrived at Pearl Harbor on 7 January . The ship , now the flagship of Rear Admiral Samuel <unk> , commander of Task Group 58 @.@ 4 , sailed from Pearl Harbor on 19 January with Langley and Princeton , to support the invasion of the Marshall Islands scheduled to begin on 1 February . Her air group at this time consisted of 36 Hellcats of VF @-@ 12 , 24 Dauntlesses of VB @-@ 12 and eight Avengers of VT @-@ 8 . As part of the preliminary operations , aircraft from the Task Group attacked airfields at Wotje and <unk> on 29 – 31 January , radio stations at <unk> and <unk> Atoll on 1 February , and then attacked Engebi , the main island at Eniwetok Atoll , from 3 to 6 February , refuelled , and attacked Japanese defenses at Eniwetok again from 10 to 12 February . They provided air support during the entire Battle of Eniwetok which began on 17 February with landings at Engebi and continued until the islands were secured on 24 February . They then protected the Allied forces there until 28 February when land @-@ based aircraft assumed that role . 
 On 4 March , Saratoga departed Majuro with an escort of three destroyers to reinforce the Eastern Fleet in the Indian Ocean and allow it to attack Japanese @-@ controlled territory . She rendezvoused at sea on 27 March with the British force and arrived at Trincomalee , Ceylon , on 31 March . During the next two weeks , the carriers conducted intensive training and rehearsing with the fleet carrier Illustrious for an attack on the port city of Sabang ( Operation Cockpit ) scheduled for 19 April . For this operation , Saratoga mustered 27 Hellcats , 24 Dauntlesses and 18 Avengers . The carrier launched 24 Hellcats , 11 Avengers and 18 Dauntlesses while Illustrious contributed 17 Fairey Barracuda bombers and 13 Vought F4U Corsair fighters . The attack caught the Japanese by surprise and there was no aerial opposition , so the escorts strafed the airfield and destroyed 24 aircraft on the ground . The port facilities and oil storage tanks were heavily damaged and one small freighter was sunk for the loss of one Hellcat to flak . The Japanese attempted to attack the fleet with three G4Ms as it was withdrawing , but the CAP shot down all three bombers . Sailing from Ceylon on 6 May , the task force attacked the oil refinery at Surabaya , Java , on 17 May after refueling at Exmouth Gulf , Australia . Little damage was inflicted on the refinery and only one small ship was sunk for the loss of one of VT @-@ 3 's Avengers . Saratoga was relieved from its assignment with the British the next day and ordered back to Pearl . 
 The ship arrived at Pearl on 10 June and remained for several days before departing for Bremerton to begin an overhaul scheduled to last several months . Captain Cassady was relieved by Captain Thomas Sisson on 22 June although he was only briefly in command before Captain Lucian A. <unk> assumed command on 31 July . Saratoga completed her post @-@ refit sea trials on 13 September and arrived at the Naval Air Station Alameda on 16 September to begin loading 85 aircraft , 1500 passengers and cargo bound for Pearl Harbor . She departed San Francisco two days later and arrived on 24 September . The ship was assigned to Carrier Division 11 which was tasked to train night fighter pilots and to develop night tactics and doctrine . Rear Admiral Matthias Gardner made Saratoga his flagship on 10 October . Four days later , the ship was accidentally rammed by her plane guard destroyer Clark , gashing the port side of her hull . Operations were immediately cancelled and she returned to port for temporary repairs . Permanent repairs were made during a brief refit during the first week of November . Carrier qualification and other training continued through most of January 1945 .

 On 29 January 1945 , Saratoga departed Pearl Harbor for Ulithi Atoll to rendezvous with the Enterprise and form a night fighter task group ( TG 58 @.@ 5 / Night Carrier Division 7 ) along with Enterprise , to provide air cover for the amphibious landings on Iwo Jima . She arrived on 8 February with the 53 Hellcats and 17 Avengers of Carrier Air Group ( Night ) 53 aboard and sailed two days later . 
 The carrier force carried out diversionary strikes on the Japanese home islands on the nights of 16 and 17 February , before the landings began . Saratoga was assigned to provide fighter cover while the remaining carriers launched the strikes on Japan , but in the process , her fighters raided two Japanese airfields . The force fueled on 18 and 19 February , and the ship provided CAP over Iwo Jima on 19 – 20 February . The following day , Saratoga was detached with an escort of three destroyers to join the amphibious forces and carry out night patrols over Iwo Jima and nearby Chichi Jima . Taking advantage of low cloud cover and Saratoga 's weak escort , six Japanese planes scored five bomb hits on the carrier in three minutes ; three of the aircraft also struck the carrier . Saratoga 's flight deck forward was wrecked , her starboard side was holed twice and large fires were started in her hangar deck ; she lost 123 of her crew dead or missing as well as 192 wounded . Thirty @-@ six of her aircraft were destroyed . Another attack two hours later further damaged her flight deck . Slightly over an hour later , the fires were under control , and Saratoga was able to recover six fighters ; she arrived at Bremerton on 16 March for permanent repairs . 
 Because of Saratoga 's age and the number of modern carriers in service , the Navy decided to modify her into a training carrier . The aft elevator and its machinery were removed , the opening was plated over and the forward elevator was replaced with a larger model . Part of the hangar deck was converted into classrooms . While the ship was still under repair Captain Frank Akers assumed command on 27 April . The post @-@ refit machinery trials on 12 May revealed some problems with one turbine , and an explosion in one 5 @-@ inch gun wounded eleven men and wrecked the mount . The full @-@ power trials were completed on 20 May and a new mount was loaded aboard to be installed at Pearl . The ship sailed for NAS Alameda a few days later where she picked up 60 aircraft , 1 @,@ 200 passengers and some trucks for delivery in Pearl . Saratoga arrived on 1 June and became the flagship of Rear Admiral Ralph F. Jennings , commander of Carrier Division 11 . She resumed carrier qualification training on 3 June until she returned to the dockyard on 10 June for the installation of her replacement five @-@ inch gun mount . Jennings transferred his flag to another carrier from 11 to 30 June . She continued training carrier pilots after the Japanese surrender until 6 September . Over the span of the ship 's 17 @-@ year career , Saratoga 's aviators landed on her deck 98 @,@ 549 times , then the record for the most carrier landings . Saratoga received eight battle stars for her World War II service . After the war , the ship took part in Operation Magic Carpet , the repatriation of American servicemen from the European , Pacific , and Asian theaters . She left Hawaii on 9 September with 3 @,@ 712 Navy officers and enlisted men bound for the United States . In the course of the operation , she returned 29 @,@ 204 veterans , the highest total for any individual vessel .

 Saratoga was surplus to postwar requirements with the large numbers of Essex @-@ class carriers in service , and she was assigned to Operation Crossroads on 22 January 1946 . This was a test conducted at Bikini Atoll to evaluate the effect of the atomic bomb on ships . Captain Stanhope Ring assumed command on 6 March , but was relieved on 2 June by Captain Donald <unk> . The ship hosted comedian Jack Benny 's radio show on 21 April , while Saratoga was berthed in San Francisco before her departure for Bikini . 
 Operation Crossroads began with the first blast ( Test Able ) , an air burst on 1 July 1946 . Saratoga survived the explosion with only minor damage , including the ignition of the teak of her flight deck . A skeleton crew boarded Saratoga the following day to prepare her for the next test on 25 July . The ship was sunk by Test Baker , an underwater blast which was detonated under LSM @-@ 60 400 yards ( 370 m ) from the carrier . The force of the explosion lifted the vessel out of the water , knocked everything off her flight deck and knocked most of her funnel onto the flight deck . She was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 15 August 1946 . 
 In recent years , the submerged wreck , the top of which is only 50 ft ( 15 m ) below the surface , has become a scuba diving destination , one of only three carrier wrecks accessible to recreational divers ( the others are the Oriskany , in the Gulf of Mexico , and HMS Hermes , off Batticaloa in Sri Lanka . ) After a hiatus of several years , dive trips resumed in 2011 .

 = Malcolm Hardee = 
 Malcolm Hardee ( 5 January 1950 – 31 January 2005 ) was an English comedian , author , comedy club proprietor , compère , agent , manager and " amateur sensationalist " . 
 His high reputation among his peers rests on his outrageous publicity stunts and on the help and advice he gave to successful British alternative comedians early in their careers , acting as " godfather to a generation of comic talent in the 1980s " . Fellow comic Rob Newman called him " a hilarious , anarchic , living legend ; a millennial Falstaff " , while Stewart Lee wrote that " Malcolm Hardee is a natural clown who in any decent country would be a national institution " and Arthur Smith described him as " a South London Rabelais " and claimed that " everything about Malcolm , apart from his stand @-@ up act , was original " . 
 Though an accomplished comic , Hardee was arguably more highly regarded as a " character " , a compère and talent @-@ spotting booker at his own clubs , particularly The Tunnel Club in Greenwich , South East London , which gave vital and early exposure to up @-@ and @-@ coming comedians during the early years of British alternative comedy . In its obituary , The Times opined that " throughout his life he maintained a fearlessness and an indifference to consequences " and one journalist claimed : " To say that he has no shame is to drastically exaggerate the amount of shame that he has " . In a publicity quote printed in Hardee 's autobiography I Stole Freddie Mercury 's Birthday Cake , Arthur Smith wrote that Hardee had " led his life as though for the perfect autobiography and now he has paid himself the compliment of writing it . " 
 = = Early life = = 
 Hardee was born in Lewisham , South East London , near the River Thames , and came from a long line of <unk> who earned their living on tugs pulling barges on the river . He was the eldest son of Frank and Joan Hardee , spent his first two years in an orphanage while his mother was in hospital with tuberculosis and was educated at three South East London schools – St Stephen 's Church of England primary , <unk> 's School , and <unk> comprehensive . 
 Expelled from all three , he drifted into petty crime – stealing Coca @-@ Cola from a local bottling plant , burgling a <unk> and setting fire to a Sunday school piano because he wanted to see " holy smoke " . He served prison sentences for cheque fraud , burglary and escaping custody ; in 1967 , he escaped from <unk> Hall Borstal dressed as a monk . He also had convictions for arson and once infamously stole a Rolls Royce which he believed belonged to British cabinet minister Peter Walker . ( Walker later wrote to Hardee after reading about this widely reported story and denied it had been his car . ) 
 Hardee decided to turn to showbusiness as a way of staying out of trouble , saying : " There are only two things you can do when you come out of prison and you want immediate employment . You can either be a minicab driver or you can go into showbusiness " and " Prison is like mime or juggling – a tragic waste of time " . 
 = = Acts and stunts = = 
 After coming out of prison in 1977 or 1978 ( sources vary ) , Hardee joined Martin Soan 's The Greatest Show on Legs – at the time , a one @-@ man adult Punch and Judy act . Revamped as a surreal sketch group , The Greatest Show on Legs became a regular at the <unk> venue in Woolwich , alongside the likes of Rik Mayall and Ade Edmondson . Soon afterwards , in 1979 , The Comedy Store opened in Soho and The Greatest Show on Legs became regulars there , too . Their breakthrough came in 1982 , when they performed their naked balloon dance on Chris Tarrant 's anarchic late @-@ night TV show <unk> .. 
 In 1987 , as one of his many publicity stunts , Hardee stood for Parliament in the famous Greenwich by @-@ election , 1987 , as the " Rainbow Dream Ticket , Beer , Fags & Skittles Party " candidate , polling 174 votes . He then stood again in the 1992 election in order to publicise his comedy club because the election rules allowed him a free mail shot to all registered voters in the constituency . 
 Hardee regularly appeared in his own shows at the Edinburgh Fringe and arguably his most infamous confirmed stunt there was in 1983 when , performing at The Circuit venue – a series of three adjoining tents in a construction site with a different show in each tent – he became annoyed by what he regarded as excessive noise emanating nightly from Eric Bogosian 's neighbouring performance tent . Hardee obtained a nearby tractor and , entirely naked , drove it across Bogosian 's stage during his performance . <unk> this stunt in Fringe infamy , in 1989 , Hardee and Arthur Smith wrote a rave 5 @-@ star review of Hardee 's own Fringe show and successfully managed to get it printed in The Scotsman under the byline of the influential newspaper 's comedy critic . At the Fringe in 1996 , The Independent reported that he attempted to sabotage American ventriloquist David Strassman 's Edinburgh show by abducting the act 's hi @-@ tech dummy , holding it to ransom and sending it back to Strassman piece by piece in return for hard cash . The plan failed . 
 Perhaps the most @-@ quoted anecdote concerning Hardee was that , on 9 October 1986 his house was searched by the police – who were looking for crumbs – two days after he and others stole Freddie Mercury 's £ 4 @,@ 000 40th birthday cake . No crumbs were found at the house as he had already by then donated the cake to a local nursing home . He used this incident as the title of his 1996 autobiography I Stole Freddie Mercury 's Birthday Cake which he wrote with John Fleming . In another encounter with the police , Hardee was once questioned by Special Branch officers after being found on the balcony outside government minister Michael Heseltine 's hotel room , wearing nothing but a pair of socks and a leather coat containing £ 5 @,@ 200 in cash and a pack of pornographic playing cards . He had mistaken the room for that of a friend . 
 Collaborator John Fleming said of him that " At home , he occasionally put a live goldfish in his mouth to get attention – I saw him do it twice . It was often said of Malcolm , with a lot of justification , that he never had a stage act – his life was his act . " 
 In his autobiography , Hardee claimed he was the first to attempt the ' banger @-@ up @-@ the @-@ bum ' routine , later perfected and performed by Greatest Show on Legs co @-@ star Chris Lynam , in which a firework ( occasionally a three @-@ stage Roman Candle ) was clenched between the buttocks and lit to a recording of Ethel Merman singing " There 's No Business Like Show Business " . 
 The claim for which Hardee was arguably best known throughout his performing life was that he was said to have " the biggest bollocks in show business " and he became renowned for a rarely performed but vividly unforgettable act in which he would use his own spectacles atop his genitals to create a unique visual impression of French President Charles de Gaulle with his testicles representing the politician 's cheeks ; this act pre @-@ dated the Australian show Puppetry of the Penis by several years . 
 Hardee rarely appeared on television , though he did play minor roles in six Comic Strip TV films and one episode in the first series of Blackadder . 
 = = Clubs = = 
 Hardee was also renowned as a talent spotter and owner of clubs which gave vital early exposure to up @-@ and @-@ coming comedians including Charlie Chuck , Alan Davies , Harry Enfield , Harry Hill , Paul Merton , Vic Reeves , Frank Skinner , Johnny Vegas and Jo Brand , with whom he had a two @-@ year affair and whom he persuaded to become a comedian . He hosted the first @-@ ever outing of the new circus group Ra @-@ Ra Zoo , who performed comedy mime to a , for once , silenced audience . He also worked for a time as the manager of Jerry <unk> and was an occasional promoter and tour manager for his friend and neighbour Jools Holland . 
 His most infamous venue was The Tunnel Club , which he opened in 1984 next to the southern exit from the Blackwall Tunnel in Greenwich , South East London . He would sometimes introduce inexperienced stand @-@ ups to audiences with the nerve @-@ jangling line : " This next act 's probably a bit shit " but , once their performance was finished , he would often comfort those he thought showed promise with backstage words of encouragement and urge them to try again . His advice to comics who were concerned that a joke might be offensive to an audience was : " If you think it ’ s funny , then fuck ’ em . " 
 At his weekly Sunday Night at the Tunnel Palladium shows , sometimes even experienced and accomplished comedians failed to complete a whole set against the unforgiving crowd and razor @-@ sharp heckling . It was at the Tunnel Club that comedian Jim <unk> once began his act with the unwise opener , " Hello , I 'm a schizophrenic " – to be met with the lightning rejoinder from a heckler in that night 's audience , " Well , you can both fuck off then ! " 
 The Tunnel closed in 1988 and , in 1991 , Hardee opened the Up The Creek comedy club in Creek Road , Greenwich . In an upstairs bar at the club was a mural commissioned by Hardee as a parody of Leonardo da Vinci 's The Last Supper . It showed Hardee as Christ with Jo Brand , Julian Clary and other famous British comedians as the Disciples including Ben Elton as Judas Iscariot . 
 In 2001 , after he sold his percentage in Up The Creek , Hardee took over a floating pub , The Wibbley Wobbley , on a converted Rhine pleasure cruiser in Greenland Dock , Rotherhithe , by the River Thames . 
 = = Death and legacy = = 
 On 2 February 2005 , Hardee 's body was recovered from Greenland Dock , after he was reported missing from The Wibbley Wobbley on 31 January ; he had been last seen late @-@ night on 30 January . A post @-@ mortem soon confirmed he had drowned . In an inquest at Southwark Coroner 's Court on 20 July , Coroner John Sampson recorded a verdict of accidental death . It had been assumed in several reports of his death that , while trying to make his way home by dinghy from The Wibbley Wobbley to his houseboat The Sea Sovereign just fifteen yards away across Greenland Dock , Hardee had lost his balance and drowned while drunk . But the Coroner found that , whilst attempting to access The Sea Sovereign from the quayside , Hardee had fallen into the dock while drunk . 
 Police constable Martin Spirito told the court that , on 2 February : " The search commenced at <unk> At <unk> one of the officers came up and said he had found a lifeless body . I followed the officer 's line down . Six metres down I saw a white male . The male had a bottle of beer clenched in his right hand . " Police sergeant Roy Dawson , in charge of overseeing the dive , told the court : " The bottle was held in his right hand . It fell from his hand on the ascent . " 
 Hardee 's date of death is usually said to be 31 January , although Coroner John Sampson said , " He was last seen on the quayside outside the <unk> Wobbly public house at about 6am on Sunday January 30 " . 
 About 700 people attended his funeral at St Alfege 's Church in Greenwich – and it was one of the few funerals ever to get rave reviews the following day in both The Daily Telegraph and The Sun newspapers . Jo Brand , Arthur Smith , Stewart Lee and his son Frank Hardee all delivered eulogies , and the musician Jools Holland played the piano . He was cremated at Hither Green in South East London . 
 In June 2005 , there were two tribute shows at the Glastonbury Festival ; in July , a BBC Radio 4 documentary tribute ; and , in August , two tribute shows at the Edinburgh Fringe . There were five @-@ hour tribute shows at the Hackney Empire theatre in London on 5 February 2006 and 28 January 2007 to commemorate the anniversary of his death .

 = Utah State Route 143 = 
 State Route 143 ( SR @-@ 143 ) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Utah . The entire highway has been designated the Brian Head @-@ Panguitch Lake Scenic Byway as part of the Utah Scenic Byways program . This road has also been designated as Utah 's Patchwork Parkway as part of the National Forest Scenic Byway program . 
 At just over 51 miles ( 82 km ) long , it connects Parowan to Panguitch while providing access to Brian Head , Cedar Breaks National Monument , and Panguitch Lake . It is also the second @-@ highest paved road in the state at 10 @,@ 626 feet ( 3 @,@ 239 m ) above sea level . 
 The western section of the road from Parowan started as a logging road for nineteenth century Mormon pioneers and was designated a state highway in 1933 . Twenty years later , the route was extended to Cedar Breaks National Monument , and again in 1985 to its present @-@ day eastern end in Panguitch . 
 = = Route description = = 
 State Route 143 begins at Interstate 15 in Iron County just west of Parowan as 200 South and travels through the center of town before turning south into Parowan Canyon . From here , the route climbs past the Vermillion Cliffs , named for their reddish color produced by iron oxides . Farther up the canyon , the highway passes by the White Cliffs as it enters Dixie National Forest , and begins a steep climb up to Brian Head . With the grade reaching 13 % in places , precipitous enough that travel by RVs or semi trucks is not recommended . 
 As the route climbs onto the Markagunt Plateau at an elevation of nearly 10 @,@ 000 feet ( 3 @,@ 000 m ) , it enters the town of Brian Head , Utah 's highest incorporated city and the home of Utah 's highest ski resort , Brian Head Ski Resort . From the top of this plateau , vistas open up allowing for views of over 100 miles ( 160 km ) in every direction . The area is populated with Engelmann spruces , aspens , and alpine meadows full of wildflowers . SR @-@ 143 continues climbing southward , passing the northern edge of Cedar Breaks National Monument , a natural amphitheater canyon eroded out of the western edge of the plateau similarly to Bryce Canyon . Here , the route reaches its highest point at 10 @,@ 626 feet ( 3 @,@ 239 m ) above sea level , the second @-@ highest paved road in Utah behind the Mirror Lake Highway at 10 @,@ 715 feet ( 3 @,@ 266 m ) . The route turns to the east here , while continuing south leads to the rest of Cedar Breaks National Monument and State Route 148 ( the Cedar Breaks Scenic Byway ) . 
 As the highway heads east , it descends through thick aspen forests interspersed with ancient lava fields . Distant views to the Escalante Mountains , Sevier Plateau , and the Pink Cliffs of Paunsaugunt Plateau are visible to the south and east . On this leg of the route , it passes around the south and east sides of Panguitch Lake , which is popular for summertime fishing as well as winter ice fishing . SR @-@ 143 continues its descent , heading northeast alongside Panguitch Creek as it enters Garfield County and exits Dixie National Forest . The route ends at U.S. Route 89 in the city of Panguitch , 25 miles ( 40 km ) from Bryce Canyon National Park and just east of the Paunsaugunt Plateau .

 Archaic hunter @-@ gatherers used this route as far back as the Fremont culture ( AD 700 – 1300 ) . Evidence of their passage is found along the roadway in the form of rock art . More recently , around the time of European settlement , the area was inhabited by the Southern Paiute people who used much of the Markagunt Plateau for hunting and gathering . 
 The town of Parowan was settled in 1851 by Mormon pioneers , who built a wagon road up Parowan Canyon to access timber for buildings . Eventually , this road extended south to Cedar Breaks . In 1919 , S. A. <unk> took the first automobile to Cedar Breaks via Parowan Canyon . With improvements to the road completed by 1921 , he was able to take visitors on weekly trips to the area . 
 = = = Parowan to Cedar Breaks = = = 
 State Route 143 was first commissioned in 1933 as the road from Parowan to the Dixie National Forest boundary . The route was extended in 1953 to reach from U.S. Route 91 ( former State Route 1 ) in Parowan ( Main Street ) to the north boundary of Cedar Breaks National Monument , increasing its length to over 17 miles ( 27 km ) . 
 The construction of Interstate 15 ( I @-@ 15 ) in the Parowan area caused the state legislature to twice modify the alignment of SR @-@ 143 . The first change came in 1968 , due to I @-@ 15 being constructed to bypass Parowan west of town , rather than following the route of US @-@ 91 / SR @-@ 1 through the center of town . As a result , the state legislature moved SR @-@ 1 west onto the interstate alignment while keeping the old alignment in the state highway system . This was accomplished by designating the former southwestern part of SR @-@ 1 from I @-@ 15 at Summit to Center street in Parowan as a new highway ( SR @-@ 38 ) and extending SR @-@ 143 through north Parowan up to I @-@ 15 , incorporating the northwestern part of the former SR @-@ 1 alignment . 
 In 1975 , the construction of I @-@ 15 was complete , including a second Parowan interchange that had not been in the original plans . This interchange was located west of Parowan , between the Summit interchange to the southwest , and the Parowan interchange to the north . In response , the legislature rerouted SR @-@ 143 to connect to the west interchange . Instead of turning north on Main Street , SR @-@ 143 now turned south on Main Street for two blocks ( coinciding with SR @-@ 38 ) and turned west to reach the new interchange . The two blocks of Main Street overlapping SR @-@ 38 were transferred to SR @-@ 143 , with the remainder of that route deleted and withdrawn from the state highway system . The former route of SR @-@ 143 northerly through Parowan was re @-@ designated SR @-@ 274 . 
 = = = Cedar Breaks to Panguitch = = = 
 The other end of SR @-@ 143 has undergone route changes as well . Prior to 1969 , SR @-@ 55 connected SR @-@ 14 with the southern boundary of Cedar Breaks National Monument . That year , as part of a major realignment of state highways , SR @-@ 55 was deleted and its road was designated as part of SR @-@ 143 . This left SR @-@ 143 as a non @-@ contiguous highway , as the portion going through the national monument was not part of the highway designation . 
 In 1985 , the southern portion of SR @-@ 143 between SR @-@ 14 and the southern Cedar Breaks National Monument boundary was re @-@ designated SR @-@ 148 , and Panguitch Lake Road from the eastern monument boundary to US @-@ 89 in Panguitch was added to SR @-@ 143 . In this same legislative resolution , there was a provision that the portion of the route alignments inside the boundaries of the national monument would be included as part of the state highway system once the Utah Department of Transportation was granted a right @-@ of @-@ way easement from federal authorities . In 1994 , the legislative description of SR @-@ 143 was updated to reflect that this easement had been granted . Interestingly , SR @-@ 148 still ends at the south boundary of the national monument . 
 The route was designated as a Utah Scenic Byway called Brian Head @-@ Panguitch Lake Scenic Byway in 1989 , and as a Forest Service Byway called Utah 's Patchwork Parkway in 2000 . It is also currently being considered for nomination as a federal All @-@ American Road .

 = Richard Coote , 1st Earl of Bellomont = 
 Richard Coote , 1st Earl of Bellomont ( sometimes spelled <unk> , 1636 – 5 March 1700 / 01 ) , known as The Lord Coote between 1683 @-@ 89 , was a member of the English Parliament and a colonial governor . Born in Ireland , he was an early supporter of William and Mary , siding with them in the Glorious Revolution . 
 In 1695 he was given commissions as governor of the provinces of New York , Massachusetts Bay , and New Hampshire , which he held until his death . He did not arrive in the New World until 1698 , and spent most of his tenure as governor in New York . He spent a little over a year in Massachusetts , and only two weeks in New Hampshire . His time in New York was marked by divisive politics resulting from Leisler 's Rebellion ( 1689 – 1691 ) , and difficult and ultimately unsuccessful negotiations to keep the Iroquois from engaging in peace talks with New France . Frontier issues were also in the forefront during his time in Massachusetts and New Hampshire , where lumber and security from the Abenaki threat dominated his tenure . 
 He was a major financial sponsor of William Kidd , whose privateering was later deemed to have descended into piracy . Bellomont engineered the arrest of Kidd in Boston , and had him returned to England , where he was tried , convicted , and hanged . 
 = = Early life and career = = 
 Richard Coote was born in Ireland in 1636 . He was the second son , but the first to survive infancy , of Richard Coote , third son of Sir Charles Coote , 1st Baronet , and Mary , daughter of Sir George St George . His father was created Baron Coote of <unk> in 1660 ( on the same day as his uncle was created Earl of <unk> ) , and he succeeded his father as Baron Coote on the latter 's death on 10 July 1683 . 
 Little is recorded of his early years . In 1677 he is known to have killed a man in a duel for the affections of a young lady . He did not marry her , however , and in 1680 he married Catherine , the daughter of Bridges Nanfan and the eventual heir to <unk> Court in Worcestershire . They had two sons . 
 Following the accession of the pro @-@ Catholic James II to the English throne , Coote , a Protestant , moved to the Continent and served as a captain of horse in the Dutch army . Because of the family 's record of service to Charles II , his absence from court eventually drew the king 's attention , and he was summoned back to court in 1687 . He was one of the first to join William of Orange in the Glorious Revolution of 1688 that brought William and Mary to the throne . He was rewarded for this loyalty with an appointment as Treasurer to the Queen in 1689 , a post he held until 1694 . It also drew unfavourable attention in the Irish Parliament . That body , still under the influence of James , attainted him and seized his lands . As a result of this , William on 2 November 1689 created him Earl of Bellomont , and granted him over 77 @,@ 000 acres ( 31 @,@ 000 ha ) of forfeited Irish lands . The land grant was highly controversial in Parliament , and was eventually rescinded by William . He was also rewarded with the governorship of County Leitrim . 
 Bellomont was Member of Parliament for Droitwich from 1688 to 1695 . In the 1690s he became involved in the attempts by Jacob Leisler 's son to clear his father 's name . Leisler had been a leading force in the New York rebellion against the Dominion of New England established by King James . Upon the arrival of Henry Sloughter as governor of New York , Leisler was arrested , tried , and executed for treason , and his properties were seized . Leisler 's son Jacob Jr. traveled to England to argue the case for restoration of the family properties . Bellomont sat on the Parliamentary committee that examined the evidence , and spoke in Parliament in support of the Leisler 's case . He strongly stated his view that Leisler and son @-@ in @-@ law Jacob Milborne had been " barbarously murdered " by Sloughter 's actions in a letter to Massachusetts colonial agent Increase Mather . Young Leisler 's efforts were successful : Parliament voted to reverse the attainder , and ordered that the family properties be restored . 
 = = Colonial governor = = 
 The death in 1695 of Sir William Phips vacated the governorship of the Province of Massachusetts Bay . Colonial agents lobbied to select either Wait Winthrop or Joseph Dudley , both native sons , to replace Phips , but the king , wanting someone who would better represent crown authority , selected Bellomont . Since William wanted someone who could exert authority over more of New England , he was also given the governorships of New Hampshire , and New York . The major concern that Bellomont was instructed to address was ongoing problems with piracy , including the open commerce with pirates that went on in New York City and Rhode Island . 
 Bellomont 's commissions were not finalized until 1 June 1697 . While they were being worked on , New York colonial agent Robert Livingston proposed to Bellomont that a privateer be outfitted to combat piracy , and recommended William Kidd be its captain . This scheme received the assent of King William , who issued a letter of marque to Kidd for the purpose , as well as a special commission for dealing with pirates . Bellomont raised £ 6 @,@ 000 ( including £ 1 @,@ 000 of his own money , and funds from some of the Lords of the Admiralty ) to outfit Kidd 's ship . 
 = = = New York = = = 
 Bellomont sailed for New York in late 1697 , accompanied by his wife and her cousin , John Nanfan , who had been appointed Lieutenant Governor of New York . The voyage was exceptionally stormy , and Bellomont 's ship was blown well south , eventually putting into Barbados before continuing on to New York . He arrived in New York City on 2 April 1698 . Bellomont 's stylish dress , good looks , and positive relationship with the king predisposed New Yorkers to like him , but he very quickly ran into difficulties and began making enemies . 
 His attempts to enforce the Navigation Acts predictably turned merchants and traders against him . These attempts were also poorly executed by colonial officials whose interests lay more with those merchants than they did with the crown . He raised the anger of Leisler 's opponents by implementing the parliamentary act he had helped pass , and saw through the restoration of Leisler 's properties . There was so much opposition within his council to this that he ended up purging the council of those opposed . Bellomont also approved the exhumation of the remains of Leisler and his son @-@ in @-@ law Jacob Milborne , which had been unceremoniously buried under the gallows from which they had been hanged . He sanctioned a proper burial , and provide an honour guard of 100 soldiers for the service . 
 Bellomont 's support of the <unk> proved to be costly , not just in terms of New York politics , but in Indian diplomacy as well . Benjamin Fletcher , Bellomont 's predecessor in office , had taken advantage of the long period between Bellomont 's appointment and arrival to make some questionable land grants , including extended leases to properties normally allocated for the governor 's use , and in territories that were still claimed by the Iroquois . When the provincial assembly passed a law retracting all of these irregular grants , it predictably angered a number of large landowners . Land grants made in Iroquois territory to <unk> <unk> , the influential pastor of the Dutch Reformed Church in Albany , and others were a specific subject of Iroquois complaints . Even though Bellomont 's law was passed , the grantees appealed to the Board of Trade , and the bill never received royal assent . 
 Bellomont denied <unk> and other anti @-@ <unk> positions of importance in dealing with the Iroquois , resulting in the loss of experienced negotiators . This affected internal Iroquois politics , since supporters of interaction with the English lost influence when their English counterparts were sidelined . This came at a particularly delicate time , when Bellomont was working to strengthen the Covenant Chain that had been neglected by Fletcher . 
 After the Treaty of Ryswick ended war between the French and English in 1697 , the French continued to make war on the Iroquois ( primarily through their Algonquian allies in the Great Lakes region ) , and inflicted significant casualties on them . The Iroquois sought the assistance of the English to combat this , threatening to make peace with the French if they did not receive help . Bellomont and French Governor General Louis @-@ Hector de Callière both claimed dominance over the Iroquois , and each refused to acknowledge the other 's right to intercede on their behalf . When Callière summoned the Iroquois to Montreal for negotiations in 1699 , Bellomont was alerted , and successfully manoeuvred the Iroquois into not going by sending an emissary to Montreal and troops to Albany under Lieutenant Governor Nanfan . The English emissary was unsuccessful in swaying the French from their course of action , and French @-@ allied Algonquians made incursions deep into Iroquois territory in 1700 . 
 In negotiations with the Iroquois , Bellomont overlooked some of the social elements that Iroquois customs demanded , with the result that the parties ended with differing views of how successful their councils were . Bellomont believed they went well , even though it was fairly clear that the Iroquois negotiators were unhappy with how the discussion had gone . He promised them the construction of a fort at Onondaga , and even convinced the legislature to appropriate £ 1 @,@ 000 for its construction , but the Iroquois were evasive on accepting this " gift " , and never showed English engineers suitable locations for a fort . Bellomont 's attempts to prevent the Iroquois from dealing with the French were negated by the French military successes of 1700 , which brought the Iroquois to a peace council that resulted in the 1701 Great Peace of Montreal . 
 = = = Massachusetts and New Hampshire = = = 
 In May 1699 Bellomont sailed for Boston . Bellomont spent 14 months in New England in 1699 and 1700 , spending a few weeks of that time in New Hampshire and the rest in Massachusetts . In Massachusetts he was treated politely , but his attempts to implement the crown 's policies ran into trouble , as they had in New York . He was refused a salary by the colonial legislature , although the " gift " of £ 1 @,@ 000 he received was more than that typically given other governors of the province . The legislature also made repeated attempts to limit appeals to London of judicial decisions handed down by provincial courts . Bellomont , as he was required to do , forwarded laws passed by the legislature to the Board of Trade for approval ; these laws were repeatedly struck down because of provisions that attempted to limit royal prerogatives . He also sided politically against Lieutenant Governor William Stoughton , who was an ally of Joseph Dudley , a Massachusetts native who had presided over the trial of Jacob Leisler . Instead he took council with the populist leader Elisha Cooke , Sr. 
 Not long after his arrival in Boston , Bellomont engineered the arrest of William Kidd . Rumors had reached the colonies that Kidd had descended into piracy , and he came to be viewed by Bellomont and the other high @-@ profile investors in Kidd 's ship as a liability . In November 1698 the Admiralty issued orders to all colonial governors to apprehend Kidd . When he was informed by an agent of Kidd 's in June 1699 that Kidd was in the area , Bellomont sent a message back to Kidd , promising clemency . Kidd responded that he would come , sending some of his treasures as a present to Lady Bellomont ; she refused them . 
 After Kidd 's arrival in Boston on 3 July , Bellomont demanded from Kidd a written account of his travels , which Kidd , after haggling over the time , agreed to deliver on the morning of 6 July . When he did not do so , Bellomont issued a warrant for his arrest . It was executed as Kidd was en route to see Bellomont at midday the same day . Kidd then attempted to negotiate his freedom , using the secret locations of his treasure and a captured prize ship as bargaining chips . Although a portion of Kidd 's treasure was recovered , it did not buy Kidd 's freedom , and he was shipped to London in April 1700 , where he was tried , convicted , and hanged . In contrast to the relative secrecy with which he conducted some of his communications with Kidd , Bellomont was scrupulous in his dealings with other potentially questionable merchant and pirate business , despite being offered as much as £ 5 @,@ 000 to overlook illicit activities . 
 Matters of frontier security and the lumber trade dominated his brief administration in New England . New England was recognized as an important source of ship masts for the Royal Navy , and the Board of Trade and the Admiralty sought to reserve suitable trees for the crown 's benefit . In both provinces he encountered opposition to entrenched land and timber interests that resented the intrusion of surveyors onto their lands , and interfered with their taking of lumber from lands that had not been granted and were thus reserved to the crown . 
 In New Hampshire the timber dispute was overlaid by ongoing disputes between local landowners and Samuel Allen , a London merchant who had acquired the territorial claims of the heirs of John Mason , the province 's founder , and was pursuing them against those landowners . Allen , who had been commissioned governor of the province in 1692 , only came to the colony in 1698 to take a direct interest in its affairs . During Bellomont 's brief visit to New Hampshire in July and August 1699 , Allen attempted to buy him to his side . Allen offered his daughter ( with a large dowry ) as a marriage match for the earl 's son ; Bellomont refused the offer . 
 = = = Abenaki relations = = = 
 The frontier situation that Bellomont encountered during his time in Massachusetts and New Hampshire was somewhat tense , because the Abenaki of northern New England ( like the Iroquois in New York ) had not been involved in the Treaty of Ryswick that ended King William 's War . In the aftermath of the war they and the settlers of Maine and New Hampshire were extremely mistrustful of one another . The Abenaki felt threatened by English encroachment on their lands , and the settlers feared a return to significant French @-@ inspired raiding of their settlements . Bellomont issued proclamations to distribute among the Abenaki denying plans to take their lands , but was unable to ease the underlying tensions . One reason for this was his naive assumption that Abenaki concerns were rooted in a French Catholic conspiracy . When English negotiators attempted to separate the Abenaki from their Jesuit missionaries , this upset ongoing trade negotiations , and did nothing to assuage Puritan New England concerns over the activities of " Popish Emissaries " intriguing to make war on them . The colonial legislature passed a law banning Roman Catholics from territory claimed by the province , which included Abenaki territory claimed by Governor Sir William Phips in 1693 . Bellomont engaged in fruitless attempts to convince the eastern Abenaki to migrate west , where they would come under Iroquois influence ; this was unsuccessful , in part because the Abenaki and Iroquois had a history of conflict . Despite these difficulties , he managed to achieve a precarious peace with the Abenaki in January 1699 . 
 Abenaki relations were also complicated by misunderstandings about sovereignty . The Abenaki viewed themselves as sovereign , while the English believed them to be subjects , either to themselves or to the French . A prisoner exchange involving English held by the Abenaki and Indians held by the English was frustrated when Bellomont believed that it would be sufficient to negotiate with his counterpart in Quebec to obtain the release of the English prisoners . 
 = = Return to New York and death = = 
 He returned to New York in 1700 , where he resumed actions against piracy and illegal shipping . Following a conference with the Iroquois at Albany in early 1700 / 1 ( which Bellomont characterized as " greatest fatigue [ I ] ever underwent " ) , he returned to New York City , where he succumbed to a severe case of gout on 5 March 1700 / 01 . He was buried in the chapel of Fort William . When the fort was dismantled , his remains were moved to the yard of St. Paul 's Chapel . 
 Lieutenant Governor Nanfan acted as New York 's governor until the arrival of Lord Cornbury in 1702 . Nanfan , during his brief tenure , reached the peace agreement that eluded Bellomont . In an agreement negotiated later in 1701 , the Iroquois signed an agreement putting their westernmost territorial claims ( spanning from present @-@ day Erie , Pennsylvania to Chicago and northern Michigan ) under the English crown 's protection . 
 = = Family , titles , and legacy = = 
 Bellomont 's eldest son , Nanfan , Lord <unk> , succeeded to the earldom on his death . His second son Richard , succeeded in turn as 3rd earl on his elder brother 's death . On the 3rd earl 's death without surviving male heirs , the earldom became extinct , while the barony devolved on his cousin , Sir Charles Coote , who was later also created Earl of Bellomont . He died without male issue , and all of the titles were then extinguished . 
 Bellomont 's rule in New York was not remembered fondly . One political opponent , noting that the provincial debt rose substantially during his tenure , wrote that the memory of Bellomont " will stink in the <unk> of all good men " , and Robert Livingston reported that the debt was " a greater Debt than I had ever seen " . Bellomont 's personal affairs were also difficult to tie up : his creditors tried ( unsuccessfully ) to prevent his wife 's departure from the province in order to compel settlement of his personal debts . Bellomont 's financial issues were not unique in this respect . Later governors ( including Nanfan and Cornbury ) were arrested on charges of malfeasance and personal indebtedness at the behest of their political opponents . New York 's debt problems were not resolved until the Hunter administration in 1717 . 
 = Beyond the Sea ( The X @-@ Files ) = 
 " Beyond the Sea " is the thirteenth episode of the first season of the American science fiction television series The X @-@ Files . It was written by co @-@ executive producers Glen Morgan and James Wong , and directed by David Nutter . The episode is a " Monster of Week " story , unconnected to the series ' wider mythology . The episode first aired in the United States on January 7 , 1994 , on the Fox Network . Despite a mediocre Nielsen rating compared to other episodes of the first season , " Beyond the Sea " received a generally positive reception amongst critics . 
 The show centers on FBI special agents Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) and Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) who work on cases linked to the paranormal , called X @-@ Files . The plot of the episode sees Scully 's father die and her skepticism put to the test by Luther Lee Boggs , a prisoner on death row who claims to have psychic powers . 
 The episode showed the protagonists reversing their usual roles of " believer " and " skeptic " for the first time , and introduced the theme of father @-@ figures that was continued throughout the series . Critical commentary has noted parallels between the character of Dana Scully and that of Clarice Starling from The Silence of the Lambs . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Dana Scully ( Gillian Anderson ) entertains her parents , William Scully ( Don Davis ) and Margaret Scully ( Sheila Larken ) shortly after Christmas . After they leave , she falls asleep on her sofa . Several hours later , she wakes up to see her father sitting across from her , speaking silently . The telephone rings , and after looking at the phone , she finds the chair empty again . She answers the call — from her mother , who tells her that her father died of a heart attack an hour earlier . 
 Meanwhile , in Raleigh , North Carolina , a young couple are kidnapped by a man dressed as a police officer . Several days later , Scully and her partner Fox Mulder ( David Duchovny ) discuss the case in Mulder 's office at FBI headquarters . Mulder relates that the case seems to be the work of a repeat offender , and there is reason to believe the couple will be killed in a matter of days . He also tells Scully that Luther Lee Boggs ( Brad Dourif ) , a serial killer he had helped to apprehend years before , has claimed to have had psychic revelations about the kidnapping and has offered to help police in exchange for his death sentence being commuted . Mulder is unusually skeptical about Boggs ' claims . 
 Later , the agents visit Boggs in prison , where he makes an impassioned revelation about the kidnapped couple based on a piece of " evidence " that is really a shred of Mulder 's T @-@ shirt . Satisfied that he is lying , the pair prepare to leave . Scully looks back at Boggs and sees another vision of her father , speaking to her and singing the song that had been played at his funeral , " Beyond the Sea " . She does not tell Mulder about this , and the pair discuss the possibility that Boggs has orchestrated the kidnapping with a partner to avoid execution . They have a fake newspaper made which declares the couple to have been found , hoping to trick Boggs into contacting his accomplice . He does not fall for the trick , but gives the agents vague clues about the case . Scully , acting on these , first finds a warehouse where the couple had been held , and later leads Mulder and several other agents to a boathouse where the kidnapper is holding the couple . The girl is rescued , but the kidnapper shoots Mulder and escapes with the boyfriend . 
 Convinced of Boggs ' involvement in the kidnapping , the prison warden rules out any kind of clemency . Boggs speaks to Scully again , claiming to be able to contact her father . He offers to relay one last message to her from him if she will attend his execution . He also gives her information about the kidnapper 's new location , warning her to avoid " the blue devil " . Scully then leads several agents to the location Boggs gave her — a brewery — where they are able to rescue the kidnapped boyfriend . Scully chases the kidnapper as he flees , but stops in her tracks when he runs along a gantry beneath the brewery 's logo — a leering blue devil . The gantry gives way , and the kidnapper falls to his death . 
 Boggs is led to his execution and sees that Scully has not attended . Scully visits Mulder in hospital , where he is recovering from his gunshot wound . She has come to believe Mulder 's assertion that Boggs arranged everything . Mulder asks her why she refused the chance to hear from her father again through Boggs . She tells him that she did not need to hear anything , because she already knew what her father would have said . 
 = = Production = = 
 " Beyond the Sea " was written by The X @-@ Files co @-@ executive producers and long @-@ time writing partners , Glen Morgan and James Wong ; it was their fourth script for the series . The episode was directed by David Nutter . As Morgan and Wong explained , their episode was written in response to criticisms of the show 's initially limited characterization of Scully . Wong said , " Gillian Anderson needed to show off her talents more , and this was a perfect opportunity to dispel those notions that Scully will never believe . It was time for the character to grow , because she was just doing the same kind of thing too often . " Executives at Fox vetoed the idea two times before Carter told the network , " we 're doing it . " 
 Don Davis was cast as Agent Scully 's father and was one of several Twin Peaks actors to appear in the series . Davis returned as William Scully in " One Breath " ( season 2 ) . Sheila Larken , who played Scully 's mother , Margaret , is the wife of the show 's co @-@ executive producer R.W. Goodwin . Larken returned for a further 15 episodes in the role . Morgan and Wong fought hard to have veteran film actor Brad Dourif play the role of Luther Lee Boggs against concerns about the cost of hiring him . X @-@ Files creator Chris Carter called the president of Twentieth Century Fox , Peter Roth , during thanksgiving dinner and convinced him to let them cast Dourif for the part . Dourif was asked to appear in the episode with only four days of preparation . He originally refused the part , until the producers gave him an extra week to prepare . While getting into character between takes , his deep breathing exercises turned his face bright purple . 
 This episode is a favorite of both creator Carter , who calls it his favorite episode of the first season and actress Gillian Anderson . Co @-@ writer Morgan also praises it as a script he is proud of . Director Nutter says of the episode , " I think it 's the most accomplished piece of directing of actors I 've been able to do ... I think this episode really made a difference in how the audience looks at Scully . I think it brought a lot of dimension to her character and for her person it definitely had a lot of impact . " 
 = = Cultural references and continuity = = 
 The episode title , " Beyond the Sea " , references Bobby Darin 's 1959 song , which is played at the funeral for Scully 's father . The appearance of Luther Lee Boggs greatly resembles Richard Ramirez . The names Luther Lee Boggs and Lucas Henry were inspired by real @-@ life serial killer Henry Lee Lucas . The Luther Lee Boggs character is mentioned by Dakota Whitney ( Amanda Peet 's character ) in The X @-@ Files : I Want to Believe ( 2008 ) . In one scene from this episode , Max Fenig 's National Investigations Committee On Aerial Phenomena ( NICAP ) hat from the episode " Fallen Angel " can be seen hanging in Mulder 's office . 
 Scully and her father 's nicknames for each other — Ahab and Starbuck — are taken from Herman Melville 's 1851 nautical novel Moby @-@ Dick . Further references to the novel appear later in the series in the second season episode " One Breath " and the third season episode " Quagmire " . 
 = = Themes and analysis = = 
 In the episodes prior to " Beyond the Sea " , the protagonists of The X @-@ Files are firmly established in the roles of believer ( Mulder ) and rational scientist / skeptic ( Scully ) . " Beyond the Sea " is the first episode in which these roles are reversed . Scully , vulnerable after the death of her father , is persuaded by Boggs ' apparent psychic ability . Meanwhile , Mulder refuses to believe the serial killer , discounts any evidence in Boggs ' favor and will only consider rational explanations . According to Jan <unk> , Scully is inclined to believe Boggs because she identifies with him : they both understand the pressure of high family expectations . Scully strongly desired to make her father proud , despite not fulfilling his expectation that she became a doctor , and Boggs , in killing his family , had hoped to kill their expectations and judgment of him . In contrast , Mulder 's relationship with his parents , based on resentment of them for their failure to protect his sister ( themes developed later in the series ) , makes him unwilling to identify with Boggs . While Scully follows her instinct and solves the case , Mulder gets shot and ends up in the hospital because of his doubts and skepticism . According to Joe <unk> , as the episode progresses , even Scully 's personality becomes like Mulder 's and " for all narrative purposes , she <unk> Mulder for almost an entire episode . " According to Dean A. Kowalski , this role reversal of the partners represents a " blending " of Mulder and Scully 's characters that is present throughout the series . 
 Scully 's co @-@ option of Mulders ' usual role also demonstrates the complexity of her character . Although she is strongly influenced by her scientific background , she has religious faith too . Paul C. Peterson notes that although this episode is not directly about religion , it shows the first of several visions Scully experiences throughout the series ; later visions appear in episodes more directly related to religion and Scully 's faith , such as " One Breath " , " Elegy " and " All Souls " . In this episode , her faith in her father ultimately proves stronger than her belief in the paranormal as she refuses to be tempted by Boggs . Rather than take him up on his offer to help her contact her father , Scully visits her partner in the hospital . 
 " Beyond the Sea " is the first episode to explore a central theme of Scully 's character development — her attraction to , and conflict with , authoritative men . Throughout her career with the FBI she experiences conflict with patriarchal figures . In the fourth season episode " Never Again " , she expresses a long @-@ held fascination with father @-@ figures . This theme is introduced with her guilt and need for approval following her father 's death in " Beyond the Sea " and continues in later episodes including " Irresistible " , " Small Potatoes " , " Bad Blood " , and " Milagro " . 
 The theme of father @-@ figures is one that is explored throughout The X @-@ Files , in relation to both Mulder and Scully . As well as their own fathers , a number of characters play a paternal role to the agents in later episodes , including Deep Throat , the Cigarette @-@ Smoking Man and Senator Matheson . Both of the protagonists have deep @-@ rooted family issues and this episode is the beginning of the exploration of that story arc . A motif often employed in the show is that of mirroring , doubling or cloning . Scully 's relationship with her father , first dealt with in " Beyond the Sea " , is mirrored by that of Mulder 's with his father — also named William — who dies at the end of the second season . 
 Comparisons have been drawn between the character of Dana Scully and that of FBI student Clarice Starling in The Silence of the Lambs . Rhonda Wilcox and J. P. Williams note the similarities in their appearances , as well as their positions in a patriarchal working environment . In " Beyond the Sea " in particular , parallels can be seen . Like Starling , Scully has an emotional connection with — and a need to prove herself to — her dead father . After William Scully 's death , his daughter becomes particularly concerned with whether or not he was proud of her . Although by the end of the episode , Scully seems to have come to terms with her father 's opinion of her , her worries resurface later in the series when she fears that he would have been ashamed of her actions ( " Anasazi " ) . The connection to Clarice Starling is further shown by Scully 's encounter with Luther Lee Boggs , an apparently helpful serial killer , which echoes Starling 's relationship with serial killer Hannibal Lecter .

 Author Phil Farrand rated the episode as the sixth @-@ best episode of the first four seasons in his book The Nitpicker 's Guide for X @-@ Philes . A writer from the Vancouver Sun listed " Beyond the Sea " as one of the best stand alone episodes of the show , saying that Brad Dourif 's acting was " remarkably chilling " . They noted that this episode was the first to center around Gillian Anderson 's character , and showed signs of Scully 's vulnerability . Connie Ogle from PopMatters ranked the episode amongst her " best " monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week episodes . Ogle felt that Luther Lee Boggs was one of the " greatest " monster @-@ of @-@ the @-@ week characters of the show , saying : " Spend a few minutes in Luther 's skeevy presence , and alien abduction seems like a blessing " . Writers for IGN named the episode their second favourite stand alone episode of the show , noting favourably how it " flips " the established dynamic between Mulder and Scully . In The Greenwood Encyclopedia of Science Fiction and Fantasy , Gary Westfahl described the episode as one of the most " highly regarded " stand alone episodes . 
 In a retrospective of the first season , Entertainment Weekly gave " Beyond the Sea " an A + , noting how it humanizes Scully and praising the casting of Dourif . Zack Handlen of The A.V. Club graded the episode a B + , praising Dourif as Boggs but wondered specifically about his intentions . Despite liking the fact that Scully was the focus of the episode and praising Anderson 's performance , he thought that its " main flaw " was the way it handled her moral crisis , opining that she appeared too weak . 
 = Blur ( band ) = 
 Blur are an English rock band , formed in London in 1988 . The group consists of singer / keyboardist / guitarist Damon Albarn , guitarist / singer Graham Coxon , bassist Alex James and drummer Dave Rowntree . Their debut album Leisure ( 1991 ) incorporated the sounds of Madchester and shoegazing . Following a stylistic change influenced by English guitar pop groups such as the Kinks , the Beatles and XTC , Blur released Modern Life Is Rubbish ( 1993 ) , Parklife ( 1994 ) and The Great Escape ( 1995 ) . In the process , the band helped establish the Britpop genre and achieved mass popularity in the UK , aided by a chart battle with rivals Oasis in 1995 dubbed the " Battle of Britpop " . 
 In recording their follow @-@ up , Blur ( 1997 ) , the band underwent another reinvention , showing influence from the lo @-@ fi style of American indie rock groups . The album , including the " Song 2 " single , brought Blur mainstream success in the United States . Their next album , 13 ( 1999 ) saw the band members experimenting with electronic and gospel music , and featured more personal lyrics from Albarn . In May 2002 , Coxon left Blur during the recording of their seventh album Think Tank ( 2003 ) . Containing electronic sounds and more minimal guitar work , the album was marked by Albarn 's growing interest in hip hop and African music . After a 2003 tour without Coxon , Blur did no studio work or touring as a band , as members engaged in other projects . 
 Blur reunited , with Coxon back in the fold , for a series of concerts in 2009 . In the following years they released several singles and retrospective compilations , and toured internationally . In 2012 , the group received a Brit Award for Outstanding Contribution to Music . Their first major release in twelve years , The Magic Whip ( 2015 ) , became the sixth consecutive Blur studio album to top the British charts . Since 1991 the band had sold over 40 million records worldwide

 Childhood friends Damon Albarn and Graham Coxon met Alex James when they began studying at London 's Goldsmiths College in 1988 . Albarn was in a group named Circus , who were joined by drummer Dave Rowntree that October . Circus requested the services of Coxon after the departure of their guitarist . That December , Circus fired two members and James joined as the group 's bassist . This new group named themselves Seymour in December 1988 , inspired by J.D. Salinger 's Seymour : An Introduction . The group performed live for the first time in summer 1989 . In November , Food Records ' A & R representative Andy Ross attended a Seymour performance that convinced him to court the group for his label . The only concern held by Ross and Food was that they disliked the band 's name . Food drew up a list of alternatives , from which the group decided on " Blur " . Food Records finally signed the newly christened band in March 1990 . 
 From March to July 1990 , Blur toured Britain , opening for the Cramps , and testing out new songs . In October 1990 , after their tour was over , Blur released the " She 's So High " single , which reached number 48 in the UK Singles Chart . The band had trouble creating a follow @-@ up single , but they made progress when paired with producer Stephen Street . The resulting single release , " There 's No Other Way " , became a hit , peaking at number eight . As a result of the single 's success , Blur became pop stars and were accepted into a clique of bands who frequented the Syndrome club in London dubbed " The Scene That Celebrates Itself " . NME magazine wrote in 1991 , " [ Blur ] are [ the ] acceptable pretty face of a whole clump of bands that have emerged since the whole Manchester thing started to run out of steam . " 
 The band 's third single , " Bang " , performed relatively disappointingly , reaching only number 24 . Andy Ross and Food owner David Balfe were convinced Blur 's best course of action was to continue drawing influence from the Madchester genre . Blur attempted to expand their musical sound , but the recording of the group 's debut album was hindered by Albarn having to write his lyrics in the studio . Although the resulting album Leisure ( 1991 ) peaked at number seven on the UK Albums Chart , it received mixed reviews , and according to journalist John Harris , " could not shake off the odour of anti @-@ climax " .

 After discovering they were £ 60 @,@ 000 in debt , Blur toured the United States in 1992 in an attempt to recoup their financial losses . The group released the single " Popscene " to coincide with the start of the tour . Featuring " a rush of punk guitars , ' 60s pop hooks , blaring British horns , controlled fury , and postmodern humor " , " Popscene " was a turning point for the band musically . However , upon its release it only charted at number 32 . " We felt ' Popscene ' was a big departure ; a very , very English record " , Albarn told the NME in 1993 , " But that annoyed a lot of people ... We put ourselves out on a limb to pursue this English ideal and no @-@ one was interested . " As a result of the single 's lacklustre performance , plans to release a single named " Never Clever " were scrapped and work on Blur 's second album was pushed back . 
 During the two @-@ month American tour , the band became increasingly unhappy , often venting frustrations on each other , leading to several physical confrontations . The band members were homesick ; Albarn said , " I just started to miss really simple things ... I missed everything about England so I started writing songs which created an English atmosphere . " Upon the group 's return to the United Kingdom , Blur ( Albarn in particular ) were upset by the success rival group Suede had achieved while they were gone . After a poor performance at a 1992 gig that featured a well @-@ received set by Suede on the same bill , Blur were in danger of being dropped by Food . By that time , Blur had undergone an ideological and image shift intended to celebrate their English heritage in contrast to the popularity of American grunge bands like Nirvana . Although sceptical of Albarn 's new manifesto for Blur , Balfe gave assent for the band 's choice of Andy Partridge ( of XTC ) to produce their follow @-@ up to Leisure . The sessions with Partridge proved unsatisfactory , but a chance reunion with Stephen Street resulted in him returning to produce the group . 
 Blur completed their second album Modern Life Is Rubbish in December 1992 , but Food Records said the album required more potential hit singles and asked them to return to the studio for a second time . The band complied and Albarn wrote " For Tomorrow " , which became the album 's lead single . " For Tomorrow " was a minor success , reaching number 28 on the charts . Modern Life Is Rubbish was released in May 1993 . The announcement of the album 's release included a press photo which featured Blur , dressed in a mix of mod and skinhead attire , posing alongside a mastiff with the words " British Image 1 " <unk> behind them . At the time , such imagery was viewed as nationalistic and racially insensitive by the British music press ; to quieten concerns , Blur released the " British Image 2 " photo , which was " a camp <unk> of a pre @-@ war aristocratic tea party " . Modern Life Is Rubbish peaked at number 15 on the British charts , but failed to break into the US Billboard 200 , selling only 19 @,@ 000 copies there . 
 The success of Parklife ( 1994 ) revived Blur 's commercial fortunes . The album 's first single , the disco @-@ influenced " Girls & Boys " , found favour on BBC Radio 1 and peaked at number 5 on the UK Singles Chart , and number 59 in the US Billboard Hot 100 where it remains the band 's highest @-@ charting single . Parklife entered the British charts at number one and stayed on the album charts for 90 weeks . <unk> greeted by the music press — the NME called it " a Great Pop Record ... bigger , bolder , <unk> and funnier [ than Modern Life is Rubbish ] " — Parklife is regarded as one of Britpop 's defining records . Blur won four awards at the 1995 Brit Awards , including Best Band and Best Album for Parklife . Coxon later pointed to Parklife as the moment when " [ Blur ] went from being regarded as an alternative , left field arty band to this amazing new pop sensation " . 
 Blur began working on their fourth album The Great Escape at the start of 1995 . Building upon the band 's previous two albums , Albarn 's lyrics for the album consisted of several third @-@ person narratives . James reflected , " It was all more elaborate , more orchestral , more theatrical , and the lyrics were even more twisted ... It was all dysfunctional , misfit characters fucking up . " The release of the album 's lead single " Country House " played a part in Blur 's public rivalry with Manchester band Oasis termed the " Battle of Britpop " . Partly due to increasing antagonisms between the groups , Blur and Oasis ultimately decided to release their new singles on the same day , an event the NME called " The British Heavyweight Championship " . The debate over which band would top the British singles chart became a media phenomenon , and Albarn appeared on the News at Ten . At the end of the week , " Country House " ultimately outsold Oasis ' " Roll With It " by 274 @,@ 000 copies to 216 @,@ 000 , becoming Blur 's first number one single . 
 The Great Escape , which Albarn told the public was the last instalment in the band 's Life Trilogy , was released in September 1995 to ecstatic reviews . The NME hailed it as " spectacularly accomplished , sumptuous , heart @-@ stopping and inspirational " , while Mojo argued " Blur are the very best that ' 95 Britpop has to offer and this is a most gong @-@ worthy sound , complete with head @-@ slicing guitars , catchy tunes and very funny words " . Entering the UK charts at number one , the album sold nearly half a million copies in its first month of sale . However , opinion quickly changed and Blur found themselves largely out of favour with the media once again . Following the worldwide success of Oasis ' ( What 's the Story ) Morning Glory ? ( which went quadruple platinum in America ) , the media quipped " [ Blur ] wound up winning the battle but losing the war . " Blur became perceived as an " inauthentic middle class pop band " in comparison to the " working class heroes " Oasis , which Albarn said made him feel " stupid and confused " . Alex James later summarised , " After being the People 's Hero , Damon was the People 's Prick for a short period ... basically , he was a loser – very publicly . " 
 = = = Reinvention after Britpop , 1996 – 2000 = = = 
 An early 1996 Q magazine interview revealed that relations between Blur members had become very strained ; journalist Adrian <unk> wrote that he found them " on the verge of a nervous breakup " . Coxon , in particular , began to resent his band mates : James for his playboy lifestyle , and Albarn for his control over Blur 's musical direction and public image . The guitarist struggled with drinking problems and , in a rejection of the group 's Britpop aesthetic , made a point of listening to noisy American alternative rock bands such as Pavement . In February 1996 , when Coxon and James were absent for a lip @-@ synced Blur performance broadcast on Italian television , they were replaced by a cardboard cutout and a roadie , respectively . Blur biographer Stuart Maconie later wrote that , at the time , " Blur were sewn together very awkwardly " . 
 Although he had previously dismissed it , Albarn grew to appreciate Coxon 's tastes in lo @-@ fi and underground music , and recognised the need to significantly change Blur 's musical direction once again . " I can sit at my piano and write brilliant observational pop songs all day long but you 've got to move on " , he said . He subsequently approached Street , and argued for a more stripped @-@ down sound on the band 's next record . Coxon , recognising his own personal need to — as Rowntree put it — " work this band " , wrote a letter to Albarn , describing his desire for their music " to scare people again " . After initial sessions in London , the band left to record the rest of the album in Iceland , away from the Britpop scene . 
 The result was Blur , the band 's fifth studio album , released in February 1997 . Although the music press predicted that the lo @-@ fi sonic experimentation would alienate Blur 's teenage girl fan @-@ base , they generally applauded the effort . Pointing out lyrics such as " Look inside America / She 's alright " , and noting Albarn 's " obligatory nod to Beck , [ and promotion of ] the new Pavement album as if paid to do so " , reviewers felt the band had come to accept American values during this time — an about @-@ face of their attitude during the Britpop years . Despite cries of " commercial suicide " , the album and its first single , " Beetlebum " , debuted at number one in the UK . Although the album could not match the sales of their previous albums in the UK , Blur became the band 's most successful internationally . In the US , the album received strong reviews ; Blur reached number 61 on the Billboard 200 and was certified gold . The album 's " Song 2 " single was also popular on alternative radio , reaching number six on the Modern Rock chart . After it was licensed for use in various media — such as soundtracks , advertisements and television shows — " Song 2 " became the most recognisable Blur song in the US . After the success of Blur , the band embarked on a nine @-@ month world tour . 
 In February 1998 , a few months after completing the tour , Blur released Bustin ' + <unk> ' for the Japanese market . The album is a collection of Blur songs remixed by artists such as Thurston Moore , William Orbit and Moby . Among the tracks , the band were most impressed by Orbit 's effort and enlisted him to replace Street as producer for their next album , citing a need to approach the recording process from a fresh perspective . 
 Released in March 1999 , Blur 's sixth studio album 13 saw them drift still further away from their Britpop @-@ era attitude and sound . Orbit 's production style allowed for more jamming , and incorporated a " variety of emotions , atmospheres , words and sounds " into the mix . 13 was creatively dominated by Coxon , who " was simply allowed to do whatever he chose , unedited " , by Orbit . Albarn 's lyrics — more heart @-@ felt , personal and intimate than on previous occasions — were reflective of his break @-@ up with Elastica frontwoman Justine Frischmann , his partner of eight years . The album received generally favourable reviews from the press . While Q called it " a dense , fascinating , idiosyncratic and accomplished art rock album " , the NME felt it was inconsistent and " ( at least ) a quarter @-@ of @-@ an @-@ hour too long " . 13 debuted at the top of the UK charts , staying at that position for two weeks . The album 's lead single , the gospel @-@ based " Tender " , opened at the second spot on the charts . After " Coffee & TV " , the first Blur single to feature Coxon on lead vocals , managed to only reach number 11 in the UK , manager Chris Morrison demanded a chart re @-@ run because of what he deemed was a sales miscalculation . 
 In July 1999 , in celebration of their tenth anniversary , Blur released a 22 @-@ CD limited edition box @-@ set of their singles . The accompanying tour saw Blur play the A @-@ sides of the 22 singles in their chronological order of release . In October 2000 , the group released the compilation Blur : The Best of , which debuted at number three in the UK and received a Platinum certification for 300 @,@ 000 copies shipped . Dismissed by the band as " the first record we have seen as product " , the track listing and release dates of Blur : The Best of were determined on the basis of market research and focus groups conducted by Blur 's record label , EMI . By this time , the group had largely disowned the upbeat pop singles from the Britpop era , and favoured the more arty , experimental work on Blur and 13 . In an otherwise highly enthusiastic review of the best @-@ of for the NME , Steve Sutherland criticised the band 's " sheer disregard " for their earlier work ; " Just because these songs embarrassed them once they started listening to broadsheet critics and retreated wounded from the big @-@ sales battle with Oasis doesn 't mean that we 're morons to love them . " 
 = = = Coxon 's departure , Think Tank and hiatus , 2001 – 07 = = = 
 After 13 and the subsequent tours in 1999 – 2000 , band members pursued other projects . Graham Coxon recorded a string of solo albums , while Damon Albarn dedicated his time to Gorillaz , the animated band he had created with Jamie Hewlett . Alex James worked with Fat Les and co @-@ wrote several songs with Sophie Ellis @-@ Bextor and Marianne Faithfull . 
 Recording for Blur 's next album began in London in November 2001 , but concerted work started in June 2002 , with the sessions moving to Marrakech , Morocco soon after , and then to Devon back in the UK . Not long after the sessions began , Coxon left the group . Coxon said " there were no rows " and " [ the band ] just recognised the feeling that we needed some time apart " . Before the album was released , Blur released a new single , " Don 't Bomb When You Are the Bomb " as a very limited white label release . The song is largely electronic , and was part of the band 's protest against war in the Middle East . Albarn , however , attempted to assuage fans ' fears that the album would be electronic by providing reassurances that the band 's new album would be " a rockin ' record " , and also said that it has " a lot of finely crafted pop songs " . Early in 2002 , Blur recorded a song that would be played by European Space Agency 's Beagle 2 lander once it touched down ; however , attempts to locate the probe after it landed on Mars were fruitless . 
 Think Tank , released in May 2003 , was filled with atmospheric , brooding electronic sounds , featuring simpler guitar lines played by Albarn , and largely relying on other instruments to replace Coxon . The guitarist 's absence also meant that Think Tank was almost entirely written by Albarn . Its sound was seen as a testament to Albarn 's increasing interest in African and Middle Eastern music , and to his complete control over the group 's creative direction . Think Tank was yet another UK number one and managed Blur 's highest US position of number 56 . The album was also nominated for best album at the 2004 Brit Awards . The band did a successful tour in 2003 , anchored by former the Verve guitarist and keyboardist Simon Tong . 
 In 2005 , XFM News reported that Blur would record an EP , and denied that they would hire a replacement guitarist for Coxon . There were also some aborted recordings made in 2005 . Overall the band kept a low profile and did no studio or touring work as a three @-@ piece . After Coxon significantly thawed on the subject of rejoining Blur , in 2007 band members announced that they would reunite , and that they intended to record together first in August , with the date later being pushed back to September , then October . Though the band members finally met up in October , they posted on their website that they had only " met up for an enjoyable lunch " and that there were no " other music plans for Blur " . 
 = = = Reunion and The Magic Whip , 2008 – present = = = 
 In December 2008 , Blur announced they would reunite for a concert at London 's Hyde Park on 3 July 2009 . Days later , the band added a second date , for 2 July . A series of June preview shows were also announced , ending at Manchester Evening News arena on the 26th . All the shows were well received ; The Guardian 's music critic Alexis Petridis gave their performance at Goldsmiths college a full five stars , and wrote " Blur 's music seems to have potentiated by the passing of years ... they sound both more frenetic and punky and more nuanced and exploratory than they did at the height of their fame " . Blur headlined the Glastonbury Festival on 28 June , where they played for the first time since their headline slot in 1998 . Reviews of the Glastonbury performance were enthusiastic ; The Guardian called them " the best Glastonbury headliners in an age " . The band released their second greatest hits album Midlife : A Beginner 's Guide to Blur in June 2009 . 
 Blur also headlined at other summer festivals , including Oxegen 2009 in Ireland , and the Scottish outdoor show of T in the Park . Their T in the Park headline slot was put in jeopardy after Graham Coxon was admitted to hospital with food poisoning . Ultimately , the band did play , albeit an hour and a half after they were scheduled to appear . After the completion of the reunion dates , James said the group had not discussed further plans , and Albarn told Q soon after that Blur had no intention of recording or touring again . He said , " I just can 't do it anymore " , and explained that the main motivation for participating in the reunion was to repair his relationship with Coxon , which he succeeded at . Coxon also said that no further Blur activity was planned , telling NME.com in September , " We 're in touch and we say ' <unk> ' and all that but nothing has been mentioned about any more shows or anything else " . 
 In January 2010 , No Distance Left to Run , a documentary about the band , was released in cinemas and a month later on DVD . In April 2010 , Blur released their first new recording since 2003 , " Fool 's Day " , for the Record Store Day event , as a vinyl record limited to 1000 copies ; it was later made available as a free download on their website . No Distance Left to Run was nominated as Best Long Form Music Video for the 53rd Grammy Awards , Blur 's first @-@ ever Grammy nomination . 
 In February 2012 , Blur were awarded the Outstanding Contribution to Music award at the 2012 Brit Awards . Later that month , Albarn and Coxon premiered a new track together live , " Under the Westway " . In April , the band announced that a box @-@ set entitled Blur 21 — containing all seven Blur studio albums , four discs of unreleased rarities and three DVDs — would be released in July . Blur had also entered the studio early that year to record material for a new album , but in May producer William Orbit told the NME that Albarn had halted recording . Blur 's official Twitter and Facebook pages announced that the band would release two singles " The Puritan " and " Under the Westway " on 2 July . That August , Blur headlined a show at Hyde Park for the 2012 Summer Olympics closing ceremony . In 2013 , the band performed at the Rock Werchter in Belgium , the Spanish and Portuguese dates of the Primavera Sound festival , and the Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival in the United States . 
 In April 2015 , Blur released their first studio album in twelve years , The Magic Whip . Conceived over five days in Hong Kong after a cancelled Japan tour in 2013 , the album was inspired by the city as well . " There 's nothing pastoral about it " , Albarn said , " it 's very urban " . The Magic Whip also marks the return of Coxon , absent on all but one track on Think Tank , and Stephen Street , Blur 's producer during the Britpop era . Upon its release , the record was greeted with applause both by the music press and the mainstream media . Awarding the album a full five stars , The Daily Telegraph called The Magic Whip " a triumphant comeback that retains the band 's core identity while allowing ideas they 'd fermented separately over the past decade to infuse their sound with mature and peculiar new flavour combinations " . The NME concurred , saying Blur were " a reunited band making music to rival their very best " . It was also a commercial success , becoming the sixth consecutive Blur LP since Parklife ( 1994 ) to top the British charts . The Guardian also noted that at times during its first week of release , The Magic Whip sold " more than the rest of the top five combined " . That December New World Towers , a documentary on the recording process of The Magic Whip , was released in select British theatres .

 = Anna Anderson = 
 Anna Anderson ( 16 December 1896 – 12 February 1984 ) was the best known of several impostors who claimed to be Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia . Anastasia , the youngest daughter of the last Tsar and Tsarina of Russia , Nicholas II and Alexandra , was killed along with her parents and siblings on 17 July 1918 by communist revolutionaries in Ekaterinburg , Russia ; but the location of her body was unknown until 2007 . 
 In 1920 , Anderson was institutionalized in a mental hospital after a suicide attempt in Berlin . At first , she went by the name Fräulein <unk> ( German for Miss Unknown ) as she refused to reveal her identity . Later she used the name Tschaikovsky and then Anderson . In March 1922 , claims that Anderson was a Russian grand duchess first received public attention . Most members of Grand Duchess Anastasia 's family and those who had known her , including court tutor Pierre Gilliard , said Anderson was an impostor but others were convinced she was Anastasia . In 1927 , a private investigation funded by the Tsarina 's brother , Ernest Louis , Grand Duke of Hesse , identified Anderson as Franziska Schanzkowska , a Polish factory worker with a history of mental illness . After a lawsuit lasting many years , the German courts ruled that Anderson had failed to prove she was Anastasia , but through media coverage , her claim gained notoriety . 
 Between 1922 and 1968 , Anderson lived in Germany and the United States with various supporters and in nursing homes and sanatoria , including at least one asylum . She emigrated to the United States in 1968 , and shortly before the expiry of her visa married Jack Manahan , a Virginia history professor who was later characterized as " probably Charlottesville 's best @-@ loved eccentric " . Upon her death in 1984 , Anderson 's body was cremated , and her ashes were buried in the churchyard at Castle Seeon , Germany . After the collapse of communism in the Soviet Union , the locations of the bodies of the Tsar , Tsarina , and all five of their children were revealed and multiple laboratories in different countries confirmed their identity through DNA testing . DNA tests on a lock of Anderson 's hair and surviving medical samples of her tissue showed that Anderson 's DNA did not match that of the Romanov remains or that of living relatives of the Romanovs . Instead , Anderson 's mitochondrial DNA matched that of Karl Maucher , a great @-@ nephew of Franziska Schanzkowska . Most scientists , historians and journalists who have discussed the case accept that Anderson and Schanzkowska were the same person . 
 = = Dalldorf asylum ( 1920 – 1922 ) = = 
 On 27 February 1920 , a young woman attempted to take her own life in Berlin by jumping off a bridge called the <unk> into the <unk> . She was rescued by a police sergeant and was admitted to the Elisabeth Hospital on <unk> . As she was without papers and refused to identify herself , she was admitted as Fräulein <unk> ( " Miss Unknown " ) to a mental hospital in Dalldorf ( now <unk> , in Reinickendorf ) , where she remained for the next two years . The unknown patient had scars on her head and body and spoke German with an accent described as " Russian " by medical staff . 
 In early 1922 , Clara Peuthert , a fellow psychiatric patient , claimed that the unknown woman was Grand Duchess Tatiana of Russia , one of the four daughters of Tsar Nicholas II . On her release , Peuthert told Russian émigré Captain Nicholas von Schwabe that she had seen Tatiana at Dalldorf . Schwabe visited the asylum and accepted the woman as Tatiana . Schwabe persuaded other émigrés to visit the unknown woman , including Zinaida Tolstoy , a friend of Tsarina Alexandra . Eventually Baroness Sophie Buxhoeveden , a former lady @-@ in @-@ waiting to the Tsarina , visited the asylum with Tolstoy . On seeing the woman , Buxhoeveden declared " She 's too short for Tatiana , " and left convinced the woman was not a Russian grand duchess . A few days later , the unknown woman noted , " I did not say I was Tatiana . " 
 A nurse at Dalldorf , Thea Malinovsky , claimed years after the patient 's release from the asylum that the woman had told her she was another daughter of the Tsar , Anastasia , in the autumn of 1921 . However , the patient herself could not recall the incident . Her biographers either ignore Malinovsky 's claim , or weave it into their narrative . 
 = = Germany and Switzerland ( 1922 – 1927 ) = = 
 By May 1922 , the woman was believed by Peuthert , Schwabe , and Tolstoy to be Anastasia , although Buxhoeveden said there was no resemblance . Nevertheless , the woman was taken out of the asylum and given a room in the Berlin home of Baron Arthur von Kleist , a Russian émigré who had been a police chief in Russian Poland before the fall of the Tsar . The Berlin policeman who handled the case , Detective Inspector Franz Grünberg , thought that Kleist " may have had ulterior motives , as was hinted at in émigré circles : if the old conditions should ever be restored in Russia , he hoped for great advancement from having looked after the young woman . " She began calling herself Anna Tschaikovsky , choosing " Anna " as a short form of " Anastasia " , although Peuthert " described her everywhere as Anastasia " . Tschaikovsky stayed in the houses of acquaintances , including Kleist , Peuthert , a poor working @-@ class family called Bachmann , and at Inspector Grünberg 's estate at <unk> , near Zossen . At <unk> , Grünberg arranged for the Tsarina 's sister , Princess Irene of Hesse and by Rhine , to meet Tschaikovsky , but Irene did not recognize her . Grünberg also arranged a visit from Crown Princess Cecilie of Prussia , but Tschaikovsky refused to speak to her , and Cecilie was left perplexed by the encounter . Later , in the 1950s , Cecilie signed a declaration that Tschaikovsky was Anastasia , but Cecilie 's family disputed her statement and implied that she was suffering from dementia . 
 By 1925 , Tschaikovsky had developed a tuberculous infection of her arm , and she was placed in a succession of hospitals for treatment . Sick and near death , she suffered significant loss of weight . She was visited by the Tsarina 's groom of the chamber Alexei Volkov ; Anastasia 's tutor Pierre Gilliard ; his wife , Shura , who had been Anastasia 's nursemaid ; and the Tsar 's sister , Grand Duchess Olga . Although they expressed sympathy , if only for Tschaikovsky 's illness , and made no immediate public declarations , eventually they all denied she was Anastasia . In March 1926 , she convalesced in Lugano with Harriet von Rathlef at the expense of Grand Duchess Anastasia 's great @-@ uncle , Prince Valdemar of Denmark . Valdemar was willing to offer Tschaikovsky material assistance , through the Danish ambassador to Germany , Herluf Zahle , while her identity was investigated . To allow her to travel , the Berlin Aliens Office issued her with a temporary certificate of identity as " Anastasia Tschaikovsky " , with Grand Duchess Anastasia 's personal details . After a quarrel with Rathlef , Tschaikovsky was moved to the <unk> Sanatorium at Oberstdorf in the Bavarian Alps in June 1926 , and Rathlef returned to Berlin . 
 At Oberstdorf , Tschaikovsky was visited by Tatiana Melnik , née Botkin . Melnik was the niece of Serge Botkin , the head of the Russian refugee office in Berlin , and the daughter of the imperial family 's personal physician , Dr. Eugene Botkin , who had been murdered by the communists alongside the Tsar 's family in 1918 . Tatiana Melnik had met Grand Duchess Anastasia as a child and had last spoken to her in February 1917 . To Melnik , Tschaikovsky looked like Anastasia , even though " the mouth has changed and <unk> noticeably , and because the face is so lean , her nose looks bigger than it was . " In a letter , Melnik wrote : " Her attitude is childlike , and altogether she cannot be reckoned with as a responsible adult , but must be led and directed like a child . She has not only forgotten languages , but has in general lost the power of accurate narration ... even the simplest stories she tells incoherently and incorrectly ; they are really only words strung together in impossibly ungrammatical German ... Her defect is obviously in her memory and eyesight . " Melnik declared that Tschaikovsky was Anastasia , and supposed that any inability on her part to remember events and her refusal to speak Russian was caused by her impaired physical and psychological state . Either inadvertently through a sincere desire to " aid the patient 's weak memory " or as part of a deliberate charade , Melnik coached Tschaikovsky with details of life in the imperial family . 
 = = Castle Seeon ( 1927 ) = = 
 In 1927 , under pressure from his family , Valdemar decided against providing Tschaikovsky with any further financial support , and the funds from Denmark were cut off . Duke George of Leuchtenberg , a distant relative of the Tsar , gave her a home at Castle Seeon . The Tsarina 's brother , Ernest Louis , Grand Duke of Hesse , hired a private detective , Martin Knopf , to investigate the claims that Tschaikovsky was Anastasia . During her stay at Castle Seeon , Knopf reported that Tschaikovsky was actually a Polish factory worker called Franziska Schanzkowska . Schanzkowska had worked in a munitions factory during World War I when , shortly after her fiancé had been killed at the front , a grenade fell out of her hand and exploded . She had been injured in the head , and a foreman was killed in front of her . She became apathetic and depressed , was declared insane on 19 September 1916 , and spent time in two lunatic asylums . In early 1920 , she was reported missing from her Berlin lodgings , and since then had not been seen or heard from by her family . In May 1927 , Franziska 's brother Felix Schanzkowski was introduced to Tschaikovsky at a local inn in Wasserburg near Castle Seeon . Leuchtenberg 's son , Dmitri , was completely certain that Tschaikovsky was an impostor and that she was recognized by Felix as his sister , but Leuchtenberg 's daughter , Natalie , remained convinced of Tschaikovsky 's authenticity . Leuchtenberg himself was ambivalent . According to one account , initially Felix declared that Tschaikovsky was his sister Franziska , but the affidavit he signed spoke only of a " strong resemblance " , highlighted physical differences , and said she did not recognize him . Years later , Felix 's family said that he knew Tschaikovsky was his sister , but he had chosen to leave her to her new life , which was far more comfortable than any alternative . 
 Visitors to Seeon included Prince Felix Yusupov , husband of Princess Irina Alexandrovna of Russia , who wrote , " I claim categorically that she is not Anastasia <unk> , but just an adventuress , a sick hysteric and a frightful <unk> . I simply cannot understand how anyone can be in doubt of this . If you had seen her , I am convinced that you would recoil in horror at the thought that this frightful creature could be a daughter of our Tsar . " Other visitors , however , such as Felix Dassel , an officer whom Anastasia had visited in hospital during 1916 , and Gleb Botkin , who had known Anastasia as a child and was Tatiana Melnik 's brother , were convinced that Tschaikovsky was genuine . 
 = = United States ( 1928 – 1932 ) = = 
 By 1928 , Tschaikovsky 's claim had received interest and attention in the United States , where Gleb Botkin had published articles in support of her cause . Botkin 's publicity caught the attention of a distant cousin of Anastasia 's , Xenia Leeds , a former Russian princess who had married a wealthy American industrialist . Botkin and Leeds arranged for Tschaikovsky to travel to the United States on board the liner Berengaria at Leeds 's expense . On the journey from Seeon to the States , Tschaikovsky stopped at Paris , where she met Grand Duke Andrei Vladimirovich of Russia , the Tsar 's cousin , who believed her to be Anastasia . For six months Tschaikovsky lived at the estate of the Leeds family in Oyster Bay , New York . 
 As the tenth anniversary of the Tsar 's execution approached in July 1928 , Botkin retained a lawyer , Edward Fallows , to oversee legal moves to obtain any of the Tsar 's estate outside of the Soviet Union . As the death of the Tsar had never been proved , the estate could only be released to relatives ten years after the supposed date of his death . Fallows set up a company , called the <unk> Corporation ( an acronym of Grand Duchess Anastasia of Russia ) , which sought to raise funds by selling shares in any prospective estate . Tschaikovsky claimed that the Tsar had deposited money abroad , which fed unsubstantiated rumors of a large Romanov fortune in England . The surviving relatives of the Romanovs accused Botkin and Fallows of fortune hunting , and Botkin accused them of trying to defraud " Anastasia " out of her inheritance . Except for a relatively small deposit in Germany , distributed to the Tsar 's recognized relations , no money was ever found . After a quarrel , possibly over Tschaikovsky 's claim to the estate ( but not over her claim to be Anastasia ) , Tschaikovsky moved out of the Leeds ' mansion , and the pianist Sergei Rachmaninoff arranged for her to live at the Garden City Hotel in Hempstead , New York , and later in a small cottage . To avoid the press , she was booked in as Mrs. Anderson , the name by which she was subsequently known . In October 1928 , after the death of the Tsar 's mother , the Dowager Empress Marie , the 12 nearest relations of the Tsar met at Marie 's funeral and signed a declaration that denounced Anderson as an impostor . The Copenhagen Statement , as it would come to be known , explained : " Our sense of duty compels us to state that the story is only a fairy tale . The memory of our dear departed would be tarnished if we allowed this fantastic story to spread and gain any credence . " Gleb Botkin answered with a public letter to Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia , which referred to the family as " greedy and unscrupulous " and claimed they were only denouncing Anderson for money . 
 From early 1929 Anderson lived with Annie Burr Jennings , a wealthy Park Avenue spinster happy to host someone she supposed to be a daughter of the Tsar . For eighteen months , Anderson was the toast of New York City society . Then a pattern of self @-@ destructive behavior began that culminated in her throwing tantrums , killing her pet parakeet , and on one occasion running around naked on the roof . On 24 July 1930 , Judge Peter <unk> of the New York Supreme Court signed an order committing her to a mental hospital . Before she could be taken away , Anderson locked herself in her room , and the door was broken in with an axe . She was forcibly taken to the Four Winds Sanatorium in Westchester County , New York , where she remained for slightly over a year . In August 1932 , Anderson returned to Germany accompanied by a private nurse in a locked cabin on the liner Deutschland . Jennings paid for the voyage , the stay at the Westchester sanatorium , and an additional six months ' care in the psychiatric wing of a nursing home at <unk> near Hanover . On arrival at <unk> , Anderson was assessed as sane , but as the room was prepaid , and she had nowhere else to go , she stayed on in a suite in the sanatorium grounds . 
 = = Germany ( 1932 – 1968 ) = = 
 Anderson 's return to Germany generated press interest , and drew more members of the German aristocracy to her cause . She again lived <unk> as a guest of her well @-@ wishers . In 1932 , the British tabloid News of the World published a sensational story accusing her of being a Romanian actress who was perpetrating a fraud . Her lawyer , Fallows , filed suit for libel , but the lengthy case continued until the outbreak of World War II , at which time the case was dismissed because Anderson was living in Germany , and German residents could not sue in enemy countries . From 1938 , lawyers acting for Anderson in Germany contested the distribution of the Tsar 's estate to his recognized relations , and they in turn contested her identity . The litigation continued intermittently without resolution for decades ; Lord Mountbatten footed some of his German relations ' legal bills against Anderson . The protracted proceedings became the longest @-@ running lawsuit in German history . 
 Anderson had a final meeting with the Schanzkowski family in 1938 . Gertrude Schanzkowska was insistent that Anderson was her sister , Franziska , but the Nazi government had arranged the meeting to determine Anderson 's identity , and if accepted as Schanzkowska she would be imprisoned . The Schanzkowski family refused to sign affidavits against her , and no further action was taken . In 1939 , World War II began with Germany 's attack on the western half of Poland . In 1940 , Edward Fallows died virtually destitute after wasting all his own money on trying to obtain the Tsar 's non @-@ existent fortune for the <unk> Corporation . Towards the end of the war , Anderson lived at Schloss <unk> with Louise of Saxe @-@ Meiningen , in what became the Soviet occupation zone . In 1946 , Prince Frederick of Saxe @-@ Altenburg helped her across the border to Bad <unk> in the French occupation zone . 
 Prince Frederick settled Anderson in a former army barracks in the small village of <unk> , on the edge of the Black Forest , where she became a sort of tourist attraction . Lili Dehn , a friend of Tsarina Alexandra , visited her and acknowledged her as Anastasia , but when Charles Sydney Gibbes , English tutor to the imperial children , met Anderson he denounced her as a fraud . In an affidavit , he swore " She in no way resembles the true Grand Duchess Anastasia that I had known ... I am quite satisfied that she is an impostor . " She became a recluse , surrounded by cats , and her house began to decay . In May 1968 , Anderson was taken to a hospital at Neuenbürg after being discovered semi @-@ conscious in her cottage . In her absence , Prince Frederick cleaned up the property by order of the local board of health . Her Irish Wolfhound and 60 cats were put to death . Horrified by this , Anderson accepted her long @-@ term supporter Gleb Botkin 's offer to move to the United States . 
 = = Final years ( 1968 – 1984 ) = = 
 Botkin was living in the university town of Charlottesville , Virginia , and a local friend of his , history professor and genealogist John <unk> " Jack " Manahan , paid for Anderson 's journey to the United States . She entered the country on a six @-@ month visitor 's visa , and shortly before it was due to expire , Anderson married Manahan , who was 20 years her junior , in a civil ceremony on 23 December 1968 . Botkin was best man . Jack Manahan enjoyed this marriage of convenience , and described himself as " Grand Duke @-@ in @-@ Waiting " or " son @-@ in @-@ law to the Tsar " . The couple lived in separate bedrooms in a house on University Circle in Charlottesville , and also owned a farm near Scottsville . Botkin died in December 1969 . In February of the following year , the lawsuits finally came to an end , with neither side able to establish Anderson 's identity . 
 Manahan and Anderson , now legally called Anastasia Manahan , became well known in the Charlottesville area as eccentrics . Though Jack Manahan was wealthy , they lived in squalor with large numbers of dogs and cats , and piles of garbage . On 20 August 1979 , Anderson was taken to Charlottesville 's Martha Jefferson Hospital with an intestinal obstruction . A gangrenous tumor and a length of intestine were removed by Dr. Richard <unk> . 
 With both Manahan and Anderson in failing health , in November 1983 , Anderson was institutionalized , and an attorney , William Preston , was appointed as her guardian by the local circuit court . A few days later , Manahan " kidnapped " Anderson from the hospital , and for three days they drove around Virginia eating out of convenience stores . After a 13 @-@ state police alarm , they were found and Anderson was returned to a care facility . In January she may have had a stroke , and on 12 February 1984 , she died of pneumonia . She was cremated the same day , and her ashes were buried in the churchyard at Castle Seeon on 18 June 1984 . Manahan died on 22 March 1990 . 
 = = DNA evidence = = 
 In 1991 , the bodies of Tsar Nicholas II , Tsarina Alexandra , and three of their daughters were exhumed from a mass grave near Ekaterinburg . They were identified on the basis of both skeletal analysis and DNA testing . For example , mitochondrial DNA was used to match maternal relations , and mitochondrial DNA from the female bones matched that of Prince Philip , Duke of Edinburgh , whose maternal grandmother Princess Victoria of Hesse and by Rhine was a sister of Alexandra . The bodies of Tsarevich Alexei and the remaining daughter were discovered in 2007 . Repeated and independent DNA tests confirmed that the remains were the seven members of the Romanov family , and proved that none of the Tsar 's four daughters survived the shooting of the Romanov family . 
 A sample of Anderson 's tissue , part of her intestine removed during her operation in 1979 , had been stored at Martha Jefferson Hospital , Charlottesville , Virginia . Anderson 's mitochondrial DNA was extracted from the sample and compared with that of the Romanovs and their relatives . It did not match that of the Duke of Edinburgh or that of the bones , confirming that Anderson was not related to the Romanovs . However , the sample matched DNA provided by Karl Maucher , a grandson of Franziska Schanzkowska 's sister , Gertrude ( Schanzkowska ) <unk> , indicating that Karl Maucher and Anna Anderson were maternally related and that Anderson was Schanzkowska . Five years after the original testing was done , Dr. Terry Melton of the Department of Anthropology , Pennsylvania State University , stated that the DNA sequence tying Anderson to the Schanzkowski family was " still unique " , though the database of DNA patterns at the Armed Forces DNA Identification Laboratory had grown much larger , leading to " increased confidence that Anderson was indeed Franziska Schanzkowska " . 
 Similarly , several strands of Anderson 's hair , found inside an envelope in a book that had belonged to Anderson 's husband , Jack Manahan , were also tested . Mitochondrial DNA from the hair matched Anderson 's hospital sample and that of Schanzkowska 's relative Karl Maucher , but not the Romanov remains or living relatives of the Romanovs . 
 = = Assessment = = 
 Although communists had killed the entire imperial Romanov family in July 1918 , including 17 @-@ year @-@ old Grand Duchess Anastasia , for years afterwards communist disinformation fed rumors that members of the Tsar 's family had survived . The conflicting rumors about the fate of the family allowed impostors to make spurious claims that they were a surviving Romanov . 
 Most of the impostors were dismissed ; however , Anna Anderson 's claim persisted . Books and pamphlets supporting her claims included Harriet von Rathlef 's book Anastasia , ein <unk> als Spiegel der <unk> ( Anastasia , a Woman 's Fate as Mirror of the World Catastrophe ) , which was published in Germany and Switzerland in 1928 , though it was serialized by the tabloid newspaper Berliner <unk> in 1927 . This was countered by works such as La <unk> Anastasie ( The False Anastasia ) by Pierre Gilliard and Constantin Savitch , published by Payot of Paris in 1929 . Conflicting testimonies and physical evidence , such as comparisons of facial characteristics , which alternately supported and contradicted Anderson 's claim , were used either to bolster or to counter the belief that she was Anastasia . In the absence of any direct documentary proof or solid physical evidence , the question of whether Anderson was Anastasia was for many a matter of personal belief . As Anderson herself said in her own idiomatic English , " You either believe it or you don 't believe it . It doesn 't matter . In no anyway whatsoever . " The German courts were unable to decide her claim one way or another , and eventually , after 40 years of deliberation , ruled that her claim was " neither established nor refuted " . Dr. Günter von <unk> @-@ Gossler , attorney for Anderson 's opponents in the later years of the legal case , said that during the German trials " the press were always more interested in reporting her side of the story than the opposing bench 's less glamorous perspective ; editors often pulled journalists after reporting testimony delivered by her side and ignored the rebuttal , resulting in the public seldom getting a complete picture . " 
 In 1957 , a version of Anderson 's story , pieced together by her supporters and interspersed with commentary by Roland Krug von <unk> , was published in Germany under the title Ich , Anastasia , <unk> ( I , Anastasia , an autobiography ) . The book included the " fantastic tale " that Anastasia escaped from Russia on a farm cart with a man called Alexander Tschaikovsky , whom she married and had a child by , before he was shot dead on a Bucharest street , and that the child , Alexei , disappeared into an orphanage . Even Anderson 's supporters admitted that the details of the supposed escape " might seem bold inventions even for a dramatist " , while her detractors considered " this barely credible story as a piece of far @-@ fetched romance " . Other works based on the premise that Anderson was Anastasia , written before the DNA tests , include biographies by Peter Kurth and James Blair Lovell . More recent biographies by John <unk> , Robert Massie , and Greg King that describe her as an impostor were written after the DNA tests proved that she was not Anastasia . 
 Assessments vary as to whether Anderson was a deliberate impostor , delusional , traumatized into adopting a new identity , or someone used by her supporters for their own ends . Pierre Gilliard denounced Anderson as " a cunning psychopath " . The equation of Anderson with members of the imperial family began with Clara Peuthert in the Dalldorf Asylum , rather than with Anderson herself . Anderson appeared to go along with it afterwards . Writer Michael Thornton thought , " Somewhere along the way she lost and rejected Schanzkowska . She lost that person totally and accepted completely she was this new person . I think it happened by accident and she was swept along on a wave of euphoria . " Lord Mountbatten , a first cousin of the Romanov children , thought her supporters " simply get rich on the royalties of further books , magazine articles , plays etc . " Prince Michael Romanov , a grandson of Grand Duchess Xenia Alexandrovna of Russia , stated the Romanov family always knew Anderson was a fraud , and that the family looked upon her and " the three @-@ ringed circus which danced around her , creating books and movies , as a vulgar insult to the memory of the Imperial Family . " 
 = = Fictional portrayals = = 
 Since the 1920s , many fictional works have been inspired by Anderson 's claim to be Anastasia . In 1928 , the silent film Clothes Make the Woman was based very loosely on her story . In 1953 , Marcelle <unk> wrote a play based on Rathlef 's and Gilliard 's books called Anastasia , which toured Europe and America with <unk> <unk> in the title role . The play was so successful that in 1956 an English adaptation by Guy Bolton was made into a film , Anastasia . The plot revolves around a group of swindlers who attempt to raise money among Russian émigrés by pretending that Grand Duchess Anastasia is still alive . A suitable amnesiac , " Anna " , is groomed by the swindlers to impersonate Anastasia . Anna 's origins are unknown and as the play progresses hints are dropped that she could be the real Anastasia , who has lost her memory . The viewer is left to decide whether Anna really is Anastasia . Another film was released at the same time , Is Anna Anderson Anastasia ? starring Lilli Palmer , which covers much the same ground , but the central character is " perhaps even more lost , mad and pathetic , but she , too , has moments when she is a woman of presence and dignity " . 
 Playwright Royce Ryton wrote I Am Who I Am about Anna Anderson in 1978 . Like the earlier plays , it depicts Anderson as " a person of intrinsic worth victimized by the greed and fears of others " and did not attempt to decide her real identity . 
 In 1965 , the musical Anya , based on Guy Bolton 's play and using the music of Sergei Rachmaninoff , opened on Broadway starring Constance Towers as Anya and Lillian Gish as the Dowager Empress — it was not successful . 
 Sir Kenneth MacMillan 's ballet Anastasia , first performed in 1967 , used I , Anastasia , an autobiography as inspiration and " is a dramatic fantasy about Anna Anderson , the woman who believes herself to be Anastasia ... Either in memory or imagination , she experiences episodes from Anastasia 's past ... The structure is a kind of free @-@ wheeling nightmare , held together by the central figure of the heroine , played by Lynn Seymour " . A contemporary reviewer thought Seymour 's " tense , tormented portrait of the desperate Anna Anderson is quite extraordinary and really impressive " . Anna Anderson was also used as a narrative device in Youri <unk> ' 1992 ballet for Theater Basel , Sleeping Beauty – Last Daughter of the Czar , based on Pyotr Ilyich Tchaikovsky 's Sleeping Beauty . 
 In December 1986 , NBC ran a two @-@ part fictionalized mini @-@ series titled Anastasia : The Mystery of Anna which starred Amy Irving and won her a Golden Globe nomination . In the words of Hal Erickson , " Irving plays the leading character in a lady @-@ or @-@ the @-@ tiger fashion , so that we never know if she truly swallows her own tale or if she 's merely a clever charlatan . " 
 The central character ( " Anastasia " or " Anya " ) of the 1997 animated fantasy Anastasia is portrayed as the actual Grand Duchess Anastasia , even though the film was released after DNA tests proved that Anna Anderson was not Anastasia . The film is an entirely fictional musical entertainment , and in the words of one reviewer , " historical facts are treated with particular contempt " .

 Man of Steel is a 2013 superhero film featuring the DC Comics character Superman . It is produced by Legendary Pictures , DC Entertainment and Syncopy Inc . , distributed by Warner Bros. Pictures , and is the first installment in the DC Extended Universe . Directed by Zack Snyder and written by David S. Goyer , the film stars Henry Cavill , Amy Adams , Michael Shannon , Kevin Costner , Diane Lane , Laurence Fishburne , Antje <unk> , Ayelet Zurer , Christopher Meloni , and Russell Crowe . Man of Steel is a reboot of the Superman film series that retells the character 's origin story . In the film , Clark Kent learns that he is a superpowered alien from the planet Krypton and assumes the role of mankind 's protector , but finds himself having to prevent General Zod from destroying humanity . 
 Development began in 2008 when Warner Bros. Pictures took pitches from comic book writers , screenwriters and directors , opting to reboot the franchise . In 2009 , a court ruling resulted in Jerry Siegel 's family recapturing the rights to Superman 's origins and Siegel 's copyright . The decision stated that Warner Bros. did not owe the families additional royalties from previous films , but if they did not begin production on a Superman film by 2011 , then the Shuster and Siegel estates would be able to sue for lost revenue on an unproduced film . Producer Christopher Nolan pitched Goyer 's idea after story discussion on The Dark Knight Rises , and Snyder was hired as the film 's director in October 2010 . Principal photography began in August 2011 in West Chicago , Illinois , before moving to Vancouver and Plano , Illinois . 
 Man of Steel was released to the general public on June 14 , 2013 , in conventional , 3D , and IMAX theaters . Despite receiving mixed reviews , the film became a box office success , grossing over $ 668 million worldwide . Critics praised the film 's visuals , action sequences and Hans Zimmer 's musical score but criticized its pacing and lack of character development . A follow @-@ up , titled Batman v Superman : Dawn of Justice , was released on March 25 , 2016 . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The planet Krypton , unstable from years of industrial mining , faces impending destruction . Jor @-@ El , chief advisor to Krypton 's supreme council , recommends a full @-@ scale evacuation of the planet 's inhabitants . Before any action can be taken , soldiers led by General Zod , an old friend of Jor @-@ El 's , launch an uprising and arrest the councilors . Realizing that Krypton is doomed , Jor @-@ El steals genetic codes sought by Zod and infuses them into the DNA of his infant son , Kal @-@ El – the first naturally born Kryptonian child in centuries . Donning his old armor , Jor @-@ El sacrifices his life to allow his son to escape on a preprogrammed spacecraft . Zod orders the rocket 's destruction , only to learn that forces loyal to the council have suppressed the rebellion . In a brief trial , Zod and several of the surviving rebels are convicted of treason and sentenced to the Phantom Zone seconds before Krypton explodes . 
 Following Jor @-@ El 's coordinates , the ship crash lands on Earth in Smallville , Kansas . A childless couple , Jonathan and Martha Kent , find Kal @-@ El and raise him as their own , naming him Clark . As he grows up , Clark becomes an isolated young man as a result of developing superhuman powers . He then learns his true origins from Jonathan , who urges him to keep his powers hidden . Several years later , Jonathan dies in a tornado while refusing to let Clark save him . Burdened by guilt , Clark leaves to travel the world under several aliases , seeking a new purpose . 
 Lois Lane , a reporter at the Daily Planet in Metropolis , receives an assignment to investigate the discovery of a Kryptonian scout ship in the Canadian Arctic . Disguised as a worker , Clark enters the ship and activates its central computer using a key left by Jor @-@ El , allowing him to communicate with an artificial intelligence modeled after his father . The AI explains that Clark was sent to Earth to guide its people , and presents him with a Kryptonian uniform bearing his family 's symbol . While following Clark , Lois inadvertently triggers the ship 's security system . Clark uses his powers to rescue Lois before donning the uniform and testing his ability to fly . Lois attempts to have her supervisor Perry White publish an article on the incident , but he refuses to do so without proof . After tracking down Clark , Lois eventually agrees to keep his secret safe . 
 Escaping the Phantom Zone , Zod and his crew travel to Earth after intercepting a transmission from the scout vessel . Deducing that Kal @-@ El is nearby , they broadcast a global address demanding that he surrender or risk war . Clark meets with the U.S. Army and agrees to comply , with Lois joining him as a hostage . Zod reveals that he possesses advanced terraforming equipment salvaged from Kryptonian outposts , which he intends to use to transform Earth into a new Krypton . His science officer , Jax @-@ Ur , extracts Clark 's genes to create Kryptonian colonists who will exterminate humanity and build a society based on Zod 's ideals of genetic purity . With help from Jor @-@ El , Clark and Lois escape and warn the Army , just as Zod orders an invasion . 
 Given the codename " Superman " , Clark destroys the terraforming platform , while his human allies launch a suicide attack , killing Zod 's troops . Vowing to eradicate humanity himself , Zod battles with Superman , and the two eventually crash into a train station . Zod turns his own heat vision on a group of passengers , but Superman kills him . 
 Now the last surviving Kryptonian , Superman persuades the Army to let him act independently , so long as he does not turn against humanity . To allow access to dangerous situations without attracting attention , Superman is hired as a freelance reporter for the Daily Planet as Clark Kent .

 Henry Cavill as Kal @-@ El / Clark Kent / Superman : 
 A Kryptonian sent by his parents to Earth as an infant to escape the destruction of his homeworld , Krypton , and raised in Smallville , Kansas , under mental guidance of farmers Martha and Jonathan Kent until he is inspired by the holographic message from his late father to become Earth 's greatest protector ( Superman is depicted as being 33 years old , at least from the moment he is found , in the present timeline of the film ) . 
 Cavill is the first British and non @-@ American actor to play the character . He was previously cast in Superman : Flyby , which was ultimately shelved , and was considered for the role in the 2006 film Superman Returns , but lost out to Brandon Routh . Cavill stated , " There 's a very real story behind the Superman character . " He explained that everyone 's goal has been to explore the difficulties his character faces as a result of having multiple identities – including his birth name , Kal @-@ El , and his alter ego , Clark Kent . Cavill also stated that , " He 's alone and there 's no one like him , " referring to Superman 's vulnerabilities . " That must be incredibly scary and lonely , not to know who you are or what you are , and trying to find out what makes sense . Where 's your baseline ? What do you draw from ? Where do you draw a limit with the power you have ? In itself , that 's an incredible weakness . " In an interview with Total Film magazine , Cavill stated he had been consuming nearly 5 @,@ 000 calories a day , training for over two hours daily and plowing protein to pack on the muscle mass . Joe Manganiello was considered for the role but could not work out an audition date for the casting director due to scheduling obligations with True Blood . Cooper Timberline was cast as the 9 @-@ year @-@ old Clark Kent , and Dylan <unk> was cast as the 13 @-@ year @-@ old Clark Kent . 
 Amy Adams as Lois Lane : 
 A reporter for the Daily Planet newspaper and love interest of Clark Kent . Adams was selected from a list of actresses that included Olivia Wilde and Mila Kunis . " There was a big , giant search for Lois , " Snyder said . " For us , it was a big thing and obviously a really important role . We did a lot of auditioning , but we had this meeting with Amy Adams and after that I just felt she was perfect for it . " Adams auditioned for the role three times : once for the unproduced Superman : Flyby , and the second time for Superman Returns before landing the current role . Adams was confirmed to play Lois Lane in March 2011 . While announcing the role , Snyder said in a statement , " We are excited to announce the casting of Amy Adams , one of the most versatile and respected actresses in films today . Amy has the talent to capture all of the qualities we love about Lois : smart , tough , funny , warm , ambitious and , of course , beautiful . " On portraying Lois Lane , Adams stated that the film would feature a Lois Lane who is an " independent , feisty woman ... but set in a more identifiable world . " Adams said that " She has become more of a free @-@ ranging journalist , someone who likes to be hands @-@ on . The nature of the newspaper business has changed so much . There is so much more pressure . " 
 Michael Shannon as General Zod : 
 A Kryptonian general and megalomaniac with the same superpowers as Superman . Viggo Mortensen was considered for the role . Snyder stated , " Zod is not only one of Superman 's most formidable enemies , but one of the most significant because he has insights into Superman that others don 't . Michael is a powerful actor who can project both the intelligence and the malice of the character , making him perfect for the role . " When Goyer was asked about why Zod was chosen as the villain , he stated , " The way ( Christopher ) Nolan and I have always approached movies as well is you never say , ' Hey , which villain would be cool for this movie ? ' You start with the story first . What kind of story ? What kind of theme do you want to tell ? So we worked that out . Then , usually the villain becomes obvious in terms of who 's going to be the appropriate antagonist for that . When you guys see the movie , the only villain we could 've used was Zod and the Kryptonians . I mean , when you see what the whole story is , nothing else would have even made sense . " Shannon also commented on his portrayal in comparison to Terence Stamp 's original take on Zod , " To follow Terence Stamp 's iconic performance in the original , it is daunting , but I just focused on one day at a time . It 's interesting that when we started with this , we did a lot of training together and I think that kind of helped loosen things up a little bit . It is a very physical movie at the end of the day . That 's a good way to find your way ' into it ' [ as an actor ] . " 
 Kevin Costner as Jonathan Kent : 
 Clark 's adoptive father . Snyder explained his reason for his casting the on @-@ screen couple is solely for the realism : " I think the thing you realize when you look at Diane and Kevin , in our decision to cast them so far , you sort of get a sense of how tonally we 're looking at the movie , and what you realize is that those guys are serious actors , and we 're taking this movie very seriously in terms of the tone of having those guys . You 're talking about having a situation where whatever the action is or whatever the drama of the movie is , our first priority is to make sure it 's rendered in the most realistic way we can get at . " 
 Diane Lane as Martha Kent : 
 Clark 's adoptive mother . Lane was the first cast member to join the film after Cavill . " This was a very important piece of casting for me because Martha Kent is the woman whose values helped shape the man we know as Superman , " Snyder said in the release . " We are thrilled to have Diane in the role because she can convey the wisdom and the wonder of a woman whose son has powers beyond her imagination . " 
 Laurence Fishburne as Perry White : 
 Editor @-@ in @-@ chief of the Daily Planet and the boss of Lois Lane . Fishburne is the first African @-@ American to play Perry White in a live @-@ action film . Fishburne stated that he modeled his character after Ed Bradley , stating that " my inspiration really is the late Ed Bradley , who was a CBS correspondent on 60 Minutes for many years ... [ The ] legendary Ed Bradley ... was a friend , a mentor , and a role model for me , particularly because he worked in journalism , and he was the kind of guy who walked with kings , but he had the common touch . And so he was my inspiration for Perry . " 
 Antje <unk> as <unk> Hu @-@ Ul : 
 General Zod 's sub @-@ commander and a commander of the Kryptonian military , who is completely devoted and loyal to Zod . Gal Gadot was offered the role but refused because she was pregnant at that time ; this allowed her to be later cast as Wonder Woman in the film 's sequel . 
 Christopher Meloni as Colonel Nathan Hardy , USAF : 
 A U.S. Air Force officer , call sign " Guardian " , assigned to the United States Northern Command . 
 Ayelet Zurer as Lara Lor @-@ Van : 
 The biological mother of Superman and loyal wife to Jor @-@ El . Julia Ormond had previously been announced as cast , but dropped out . Connie Nielsen was in negotiations for the role before Zurer was cast . Nielsen has now been cast as Queen Hippolyta in Wonder Woman . 
 Russell Crowe as Jor @-@ El : 
 The biological father of Superman . Sean Penn and Clive Owen were also considered for the role . Crowe incorporates how his own fatherhood informed his reading of the script to portray Jor @-@ El , stating that " ... it was one of those things where that 's how it was connecting me . That 's the question that Jor @-@ El faces , that 's the situation that he 's in . " Crowe also comments on his preparation for the film stating that : " When I signed on ... well , one , I didn 't realize that I would be wearing Spandex — ' cause you know that 's Superman 's costume — I didn 't realize that I 'd have to fit into it as well , " Crowe said . " But , I also didn 't realize the type of organizer that Zack Snyder is , ' cause this was really old school prep . This is sort of David Lean @-@ level preparation , and I really appreciated him . And I was on the movie for three @-@ and @-@ a @-@ half or four months before I even got in front of the camera . "

 In June 2008 , Warner Bros. took pitches from comic book writers , screenwriters and directors on how to successfully restart the Superman film series . Comic book writers Grant Morrison , Mark Waid , Geoff Johns and Brad Meltzer were among those who pitched their ideas for a reboot . " I told them , it ’ s not that bad . Just treat Superman Returns as the Ang Lee Hulk , " Morrison said . " The Incredible Hulk has proven the audience will forgive you and let you redo the franchise , " said Waid . Morrison 's idea was similar to his work on All @-@ Star Superman , while Waid 's was akin to Superman : Birthright . Mark Millar , teaming with director Matthew Vaughn , also planned an epic eight @-@ hour Superman trilogy , each installment released a year apart , similar to The Lord of the Rings . Millar compared it to the Godfather trilogy , in which it would chronicle the entire life of Superman , from the early days of Krypton to the finale where Superman loses his powers as the Sun starts to supernova . 
 In August 2008 , Warner Bros. suggested a reboot of the film series . Studio executive Jeff Robinov planned to have the film released either by 2010 or 2011 , explaining " Superman Returns didn 't quite work as a film in the way that we wanted it to . It didn 't position the character the way he needed to be positioned . Had Superman worked in 2006 , we would have had a movie for Christmas of this year or 2009 . Now the plan is just to reintroduce Superman without regard to a Batman and Superman movie at all . " Paul Levitz stated in an interview that Batman holds the key to the Superman reboot . He elaborated , " Everyone is waiting for Nolan to sign on for another Batman , once that happens , the release date for Superman and all other future projects will follow . " In February 2009 , McG , who previously planned to direct Superman : Flyby , expressed interest in returning to the Superman franchise . August 2009 saw a court ruling in which Jerry Siegel 's family recaptured 50 % of the rights to Superman 's origins and Siegel 's share of the copyright in Action Comics # 1 . In addition , a judge ruled that Warner Bros. did not owe the families additional royalties from previous films . However , if they did not begin production on a Superman film by 2011 , then the Siegel estate would have been able to sue for lost revenue on an unproduced film . 
 The plot of Man of Steel employs a nonlinear narrative , and tells parts of the story in flashback . During story discussions for The Dark Knight Rises in 2008 , David S. Goyer told Christopher Nolan his idea regarding how to present Superman in a modern context . Impressed with Goyer 's concept , Nolan pitched the idea to the studio , who hired Nolan to produce and Goyer to write based on the financial and critical success of The Dark Knight . Nolan admired Bryan Singer 's work on Superman Returns for its connection to Richard Donner 's version , stating that " A lot of people have approached Superman in a lot of different ways . I only know the way that has worked for us that 's what I know how to do , " emphasizing the idea that Batman exists in a world where he is the only superhero and a similar approach to the Man of Steel would assure the integrity needed for the film . " Each serves to the internal logic of the story . They have nothing to do with each other . " Nolan , however , clarified that the new film would not have any relationship with the previous film series . 
 Jeff Robinov , president of Warner Bros. Pictures Group , spoke to Entertainment Weekly , and allowed a peek over the wall of secrecy surrounding their DC Comics plans : " It 's setting the tone for what the movies are going to be like going forward . In that , it 's definitely a first step . " Plans included for the film to contain references to the existence of other superheroes , alluding to the possibility of a further DC Universe , and setting the tone for a shared fictional universe of DC Comics characters on film . Guillermo del Toro , with whom Goyer worked on Blade II , turned down the director 's position on the reboot because of his commitment on a film adaptation of At the Mountains of Madness , while Robert Zemeckis was also approached . Ben Affleck , Darren Aronofsky , Duncan Jones , Jonathan Liebesman , Matt Reeves , and Tony Scott were considered as potential directors , before Zack Snyder was hired in October 2010 . Casting began the following November . Zack Snyder confirmed both Booster Gold and Batman references in the film , indicating their presence in the DC shared film universe . When Zod destroys a satellite , the words " Wayne Enterprises " are scrolled on the satellite .

 Principal photography began on August 1 , 2011 , at an industrial park near DuPage Airport under the codename " Autumn Frost " . Zack Snyder expressed reluctance to shooting the film in 3 @-@ D , due to the technical limitations of the format , and instead chose to shoot the film two @-@ dimensionally and convert the film into 3 @-@ D in post production , for a 2 @-@ D , 3 @-@ D , and IMAX 3 @-@ D release . Snyder also chose to shoot the film on film instead of digitally , because he felt it would make the film , " a big movie experience " . Filming was expected to last for two to three months . Production took place in Plano , Illinois on August 22 to 29 . According to an interview with Michael Shannon , filming would continue until February 2012 . 
 Man of Steel filmed in the Chicago area , California and Burnaby 's Mammoth Studios was transformed into Superman 's home planet of Krypton and myriad extraterrestrial aircraft . Metro lands on Vancouver 's North Shore waterfront hosted the shoot for the dramatic oil rig rescue that introduces audiences to Superman . <unk> and Nanaimo , British Columbia , feature prominently in the film ’ s first hour — the trademark winter mist and rough seas are passed off as Alaska in the film . Filming took place in the Chicago Loop from September 7 to 17 . Vancouver production took place from September 21 , 2011 , to January 20 , 2012 .

 Man of Steel features a redesigned Superman costume by James Acheson and Michael Wilkinson . The costume preserves the color scheme and " S " logo , but adopts darker tones , and notably does not feature the red trunks usually worn by Superman . Zack Snyder said the costume is " a modern aesthetic " . He and the producers attempted to devise a suit featuring the red trunks , but could not design one that fit into the tone of the film , leading to their removal from the suit . Because of Wilkinson 's unavailability , Snyder chose Acheson to design the suit ; however he only started developing it , and Wilkinson finished the development when he returned , and designed the other character 's costumes as well . Due to the substantial weight a practical suit would yield , the Kryptonian armor for General Zod was constructed through CGI to allow Shannon " freedom of movement " . In a March 2014 interview with Esquire , Wilkinson explained the reason for the look of Superman 's redesigned suit :

 John " DJ " Desjardin served as the visual supervisor for Man of Steel , with Weta Digital , MPC , and Double Negative providing the visual effects for the film . Zack Snyder wanted the film to " appear very natural because there ’ s some very fantastical things in there and he wanted people to suspend their disbelief , and we the visual effects team had to make it as easy as possible for them to do so . " Desjardin noted that the intent in shooting the film was to utilize handheld devices to make the film feel like a " documentary @-@ style " film . " We had to think about what that would mean , since we also had to photograph some crazy action , " said Desjardin . " So for a lot of the <unk> we did , we ’ d start to think where our cameras were and where our cameraman was . A lot of the rules are the Battlestar Galactica rules for the space cams that Gary <unk> developed for that miniseries , where we want to make sure if we 're translating the camera at all it makes sense . Unless the action is so over the top , like in the end where Superman is beating up Zod — we had to break it a bit . " 
 For the first act of the film taking place on the planet Krypton , Weta Digital placed alien @-@ like planet environments , creatures and the principal means of display — a technology the filmmakers called " liquid geometry " . Weta Digital visual effects supervisor Dan Lemmon explained that , " It ’ s a bunch of silver beads that are suspended through a magnetic field , and the machine is able to control that magnetic field so that the collection of beads behave almost like three @-@ dimensional pixels , and they can create a surface that floats in the air and describes whatever the thing is you ’ re supposed to be seeing . " The beads of the display , which up close would appear to be pyramids with a slight bevel , were designed to create a surface of the object to depict inside a " console @-@ like " figure . 
 In the modeling and animation aspect of the liquid geometry , Goodwin explained , " We had to develop a pipeline to bring in assets , so instead of going through the route of reducing the polygon count to something usable what we would then do — you would take the model in whatever way it was made and just scatter discrete points onto it , and extract the matrix onto the animation and copy these points onto the matrix and have these sparse points behaving in a way that the model would . " After the animation , artists duplicated the beads onto the animated geometry for a pre @-@ simulated lighting version to get approval on how the object would read . Sims were then run " on all the targets which would be discrete beads floating around on top of the surface which would have its own set of parameters , " said Goodwin . " The bead size or the turbulence that would crawl along the surface constantly updating the orientation was based on the normal provided by the surface . That was then saved to disk and we would use that sim as the final target for the simulation . " After the simulation process , Weta Digital ran every bead through a temporal filter to remove jitter to control the noise . Lighting solutions directly worked on the set . Weta utilized RenderMan to take advantage of improved ray tracing and <unk> objects . 
 The sequences where Superman utilizes close @-@ combat fight scenes with the other Kryptonians proved to be a major challenge for the filmmakers and the visual effects crew . Desjardin explained , " When we do these fights and these hyper @-@ real things , we don ’ t want to do the traditional , ' OK I ’ m a cameraman , I 'm shooting a clean plate , I 'm going to pan over here to follow the action that ’ s not really there yet but we 'll put the action in later . Because that 's us animating the characters to the camera . So we would do that animation with the characters — grappling , punching or flying away — and we would take the real guys up until the point until they were supposed to do that and we 'd cut . Then we 'd put an environment camera there and take the environment . And then a camera for reference of the actors and get each moment . So then we had a set of high @-@ res stills for the environment and the characters . Then , in post , we take the digi @-@ doubles and animate them according to the speeds we want them to move in our digital environment . " 
 MPC handled the visual effects for the " Smallville encounter " sequence . Before providing the visual effects , the shots were previsualized for the fight choreography . After the <unk> , live action portions of the scene would be filmed in small pieces . " If say Superman was being punched and would land 50 meters away , we would shoot our start position and end position , and then bridge that gap with the CG takeovers , " says Guillaume <unk> , the MPC visual effects supervisor . A camera rig would then obtain key frames of the choreographed actor . " It 's a six @-@ still camera rig that 's built on a pipe rig so that you can run it in at the end of a setup and get stills of key frames of a performance or an expression , " said Desjardin , " and then we could use those hi @-@ res stills to project onto the CG double and get really accurate transition lighting and color — right from the set . " 
 On set , a camera rig was used to capture the environment of the sequence . Dubbed " <unk> @-@ cam " , the visual effects crew would mount a Canon EOS 5D and a motorized nodal head , allowing the crew to capture the environment at a 360 @-@ degree angle with <unk> resolution for every shot , the process would take approximately two to four minutes . The set capture resulted in lighting and textures that could be <unk> onto geometry . Full @-@ screen digital doubles were a major component for the fighting sequences . Digital armor was also added , along with the energy @-@ based Kryptonian helmets . <unk> and FACS were conducted with the actors , and polarized and non @-@ polarized reference photos were taken . Superman 's cape and costume were scanned in high detail — the cape in particular became a direct extensions of Superman 's actions . 
 For the sequences involving the terraforming of the city Metropolis , Double Negative handled the visual effects for the sequence . In order to construct a Metropolis that seemed convincing and realistic , Double Negative utilized <unk> 's <unk> to help procedurally deliver the city . " That was a much more sci @-@ fi based role , " said Double Negative visual effects supervisor Ged Wright , “ so we took what they had done and extended it a great deal . The work we were doing was based around the <unk> for New York , L.A. and Chicago and that gave us the building volumes for heights . We ’ d skin those volumes with kit parts , but most of it then had to fall down ! So we had to rig it for destruction and use it for other aspects of the work as well . " 
 For the destruction of the buildings , the studio rewrote its own asset system to focus towards its dynamic events . The Bullet physics software was a heavily @-@ impacted component for the utilization of the destruction . " We wanted to be able to run an RBD event and trigger all these secondary events , whether it was glass or dust simulations — all of those things needed to be chained up and handled in a procedural way , " said Wright . " One of the advantages of this was that , because it was all based around a limited number of input components , you can make sure they 're modeled in a way they ’ re usable in effects — you can model something but they 'll be another stage to rig it for destruction . " Fire , smoke , and water stimulation tools were developed at the Double Negative studio . The studio transitioned between the existing proprietary volume rendering software to rendering in Mantra for elements such as fireball sims . Double Negative also used the in @-@ house fluids tool " Squirt " to handle larger scale sims and interaction for more tightly @-@ coupled volumes and particles . Regarding the battle between Superman and Zod , Double Negative implemented real photography onto its digital doubles .

 Hans Zimmer initially denied popular rumors that he would be composing the film 's score . However , in June 2012 , it was confirmed that Zimmer would , in fact , be writing the film 's musical score . To completely distinguish Man of Steel from the previous films , the iconic " Superman March " by John Williams was not used . Hans Zimmer 's soundtrack for Man of Steel was released publicly on June 11 , 2013 . An unofficial rip of the musical score from the third trailer , entitled " An Ideal of Hope " , confirmed to be a cut @-@ down version of the track " What Are You Going to Do When You Are Not Saving the World ?

 Warner Bros. and DC Comics won the rights to the domain name <unk> , in use by a member of the public , for use for the film 's official website . On November 20 , 2012 , for the release of The Dark Knight Rises DVD and Blu @-@ ray , Warner Bros. launched a countdown on the film 's website where fans could share the countdown on websites like Facebook or Twitter to unlock an " exclusive reward " . On December 3 , 2012 , the " exclusive reward " was revealed to be an official Man of Steel teaser poster . The poster , which depicts Superman being arrested , generated a positive response and much speculation about the film 's story . On December 10 , 2012 , a website appeared at <unk> that provided audio signals to be decoded by viewers . It was discovered to be related to the film due to the copyright on the website . By December 11 , 2012 , the decoded message led readers to another website with a countdown that led to the public release of the trailer . In anticipation of the film , Mattel unveiled a toy line which includes Movie Masters action figures . In addition , Lego will release three Man of Steel sets , inspired by scenes from the film ; <unk> ’ s Costume Co. also released a new line of Man of Steel @-@ inspired costumes and accessories for both kids and adults . The film has reportedly earned over $ 160 million from promotional tie @-@ ins . 
 Viral marketing campaigns for the film began when the official website was replaced by " deep space radio waves " . The message was decoded to reveal a voice that said " You Are Not Alone " . The official site continued to be updated with new static files that slowly revealed the symbol for the film 's villain , General Zod . Shortly after , the website was replaced with a " message " from Zod , who requested that Earth must return Kal @-@ El to his custody and told Kal @-@ El to surrender within 24 hours or the world would suffer the consequences . A viral site called " <unk> " was released that showed a countdown to the third trailer for the film . 
 Warner Bros. enlisted a Christian @-@ based marketing firm Grace Hill Media to help spread the Christian themes of the film to the religious demographics .

 Man of Steel received mixed reviews from critics . On Rotten Tomatoes the film has an approval rating of 55 % , based on 300 reviews , with an average rating of 6 @.@ 2 / 10 . The site 's consensus reads , " Man of Steel 's exhilarating action and spectacle can 't fully overcome its detours into generic blockbuster territory . " On Metacritic , the film received a weighted score of 55 out of 100 , based on 47 critics , indicating " mixed or average reviews " . Audience polls in North America from CinemaScore for the film tallied an average grade of an " A – " on an A + to F scale , with those under the age of 18 and older than 50 giving it an " A " . Cavill 's performance as Superman earned mixed reviews , with some critics commenting on perceived stiffness and a lack of charisma . 
 Richard Roeper of the Chicago Sun @-@ Times said that Man of Steel covered no new ground with regard to Superman films , and instead , " we 're plunged back into a mostly underwhelming film , with underdeveloped characters and supercharged fight scenes that drag on and offer nothing new in the way of special @-@ effects creativity " . The Boston Globe 's Ty Burr wrote , " What ’ s missing from this Superman saga is a sense of lightness , of pop joy " . The Washington Post 's Ann Hornaday stated that with " Hans Zimmer ’ s turgid , over @-@ produced score " , the film " is an exceptionally unpleasant viewing experience " . For The Denver Post 's Lisa Kennedy , the chief problem with Man of Steel is the " rhythm and balance in the storytelling and directing " which resulted in a film that swings " between destructive overstatement and flat @-@ footed homilies . " 
 Kofi Outlaw , Editor @-@ in @-@ Chief at <unk> , gave Man of Steel a 4 out of 5 star review , stating that " Man of Steel has more than earned its keep , and deserves to be THE iconic Superman movie for a whole new generation " . He would go on to name Man of Steel the best Superhero movie of 2013 . Jim Vejvoda of IGN gave Man of Steel a 9 out of 10 while praising the action sequences and the performances of Kevin Costner , Russell Crowe and Michael Shannon . Peter Travers of Rolling Stone gave it a 3 stars out of 4 , saying , " Caught in the slipstream between action and angst , Man of Steel is a bumpy ride for sure . But there 's no way to stay blind to its wonders . " Todd McCarthy of The Hollywood Reporter said rebooting the franchise was unnecessary , but that the film was confident enough and Snyder 's attention to detail careful enough that audiences could overlook another reboot . PopMatters journalist J.C. Maçek , III , wrote , " The path of this flawed savior isn ’ t quite the one that we have been led to expect and many fans will love that and many fans will decry its comic book @-@ divergent choices . On the other hand , barring Lois Lane ’ s own knowledge of the dual nature of Clark and Superman ( thus depriving one of fiction ’ s greatest reveals ) , the hero we see in the final moments of Man of Steel is nothing if not the character Jerry Siegel and Joe Shuster created … with just a bit more in the ' imperfections ' column . " Steve Persall of the Tampa Bay Times stated that , " Man of Steel is more than just Avengers @-@ sized escapism ; it 's an artistic introduction to a movie superhero we only thought we knew . " Time magazine 's Richard Corliss said , " The movie finds its true , lofty footing not when it displays Kal @-@ El ’ s extraordinary powers , but when it dramatizes Clark Kent ’ s roiling humanity . The super part of Man of Steel is just okay , but the man part is super . " In a review on Roger Ebert 's website , Matt Zoller Seitz awarded the film three out of four stars , calling it an " astonishing movie " and praising the conflict between Clark and Zod . But he criticized the film for not having more personal and intimate moments between Clark and Lois . In 2014 , Empire ranked Man of Steel the 286th greatest film ever made on their list of " The 301 Greatest Movies Of All Time " as voted by the magazine 's readers . 
 Speaking to Fox Business Channel , Grae Drake , editor of Rotten Tomatoes , expressed dismay over the critical reception , stating , " As much as I love and respect our critics at Rotten Tomatoes , I 've got to say I am shocked . Listen , the movie ’ s not perfect but ... I just cannot fathom it . It was a good movie , you guys . " 
 Reaction to the film among comics creators was mixed . Those who enjoyed it include Jeff Parker , Heidi MacDonald , Ethan Van Sciver , Christos Gage and former Superman writer Dan Jurgens . Among its detractors were Joe <unk> , Sean McKeever , Gabriel Hardman and Mark Waid . MacDonald praised the film 's action , drama and leads Henry Cavill and Amy Adams . Van Sciver singled out Cavill in particular for praise . Gage called it the best Superman film since 1980 's Superman II . Hardman said that he liked a lot of the mechanics but did not connect with the characters , which robbed the story of tension . Waid , who wrote the origin miniseries Superman : Birthright , criticized the film for its overall " joyless " tone , and for Superman 's decision to kill Zod , a criticism echoed by other creators . Writer Grant Morrison , who wrote the critically acclaimed miniseries All @-@ Star Superman , expressed mixed reaction to the film , saying that while he " kinda liked it and kinda didn ’ t " , it did not present anything new , as he would have preferred a " second act " type story with Lex Luthor instead of re @-@ establishing the character by presenting information Morrison is already familiar with . Morrison also questioned the need for a superhero to kill , as did artist Neal Adams , who suggested that other avenues were open to Superman when Zod threatened innocents with his heat vision , such as covering his eyes . Adams further took issue with Superman 's failure to move the final battle with Zod away from the heavily populated Metropolis , as the character did at the end of Superman II .

Before Jor @-@ El sends his son off to Earth baby Moses @-@ style , he tells his wife that , like Jesus , ' He ’ ll be a god to them . ' " Paul Asay of The Washington Post writes that " Superman floats in space with his arms splayed out as if nailed to an invisible cross , " a fact that Craig also mentioned in his assessment of the film . The protagonist of the film is also 33 years old and seeks " counsel at a church . " Writing for The Huffington Post , Colin Liotta compared Zod to Adolf Hitler , citing , " He feels his vision for a pure Krypton ( i.e. a society like the one Hitler envisioned with his eugenics program ) is the only answer for survival .

 = Trial of Lex Wotton = 
 The trial of Lex Wotton relates to the events surrounding the Townsville , Queensland proceedings in the Federal Magistrates Court concerning the actions taken by Palm Island Aboriginal Shire Council member Wotton during the 26 November 2004 Palm Island riots . 
 Wotton was a two @-@ time councillor on the Palm Island Aboriginal Shire Council when Cameron Doomadgee died in custody . Wotton led approximately 1 @,@ 000 people in the Palm Island Riots . Wotton was arrested , but on his release , he was hailed as a hero by many residents of Palm Island . He continued to act as a leader and even ran for mayor of the North Queensland Aboriginal community . Approximately four years after the riot , Wotton was found guilty of inciting a riot and sentenced to seven years in prison . 
 = = Wotton = = 
 Wotton was a plumber by trade and the plumber for Palm Island as well as an Aboriginal elder , an indigenous activist of prominence and co author . He also married and is the father of four children . 
 In October 2002 , at age 34 , Wotton was elected to his second term as councilor on the Palm Island Aboriginal Shire Council in an ATSIC Regional Council elections where he was one of eight nominations seeking two positions . In May 2003 , Wotton supported a group of Palm Island women who called for the resignation of council chairwoman Delena Foster , asserting that she " diminished the rights of all islanders by proposing a strict new alcohol ban " as well as threatening a significant source of income for the area . Eleven days later , Wotton stated that the council had only $ 600 @,@ 000 left in its reserves to run the island until the end of June – a claim chairwoman Foster heatedly disputed by saying that the council in fact had $ 1 @.@ 5 million . By the end of June , Wotton became fed up with the Palm Island Aboriginal Council 's practices and handed in his resignation , reasoning that in the 3 ½ years he was on the council , the body did not achieve one long @-@ term success . 
 Wotton , a plumber by trade , then kept his name in the public by writing to Letters to the Editor of the Townsville Bulletin to get his messages out . For example , in November 2003 , Wotton 's letter to the editor praised the decision to dissolve the Palm Island Aboriginal Council , since it would allow Palm Island " to adopt the very principles and practice of good governance and to see it effectively and efficiently discharged for the benefit of all in our community . " In March 2004 , he wrote an open letter to the recently reelected official Mike Reynolds , requesting an explanation as to why the jetty at Arcadia Bay received part of a massive injection of state money whereas no state funds were allocated for the dilapidated Palm Island jetty , even though 86 per cent of the Palm Island vote went to Reynolds . At the end of March , Wotton was one of eight candidates for the new Palm Island Community Council .

 On Friday 19 November 2004 , 36 @-@ year @-@ old Palm Island resident Cameron Doomadgee was arrested for public drunkenness and died in police custody an hour later . The coroner 's report was released on Friday 26 November , and read to a community meeting . After hearing that Doomadgee had died from a ruptured liver in the scuffle at the island 's watch @-@ house , a succession of angry young Aboriginal men spoke to the crowd and encouraged immediate action be taken against the police . Doomadgee 's death was repeatedly branded " cold @-@ blooded murder " . Wotton joined 1 @,@ 000 other people in a riot on Palm Island that resulted in the police station , the court house , and the home of the officer @-@ in @-@ charge being burned down . In a Friday interview with the The Courier @-@ Mail , Wotton justified the riot , saying that the residents did not believe the death was an accident and the residents had set fire to the police station because they had been " crying out for help " and no one had listened . Additionally , Wotton sought an investigation by the Crime and Misconduct Commission ( CMC ) and wanted the government to agree to move all police from the island . 
 Before his Courier @-@ Mail newspaper interview was delivered to the public and in response to Wotton 's actions during the riot , police entered Wotton 's home at 4 : 45 am Saturday and used a stun gun on the back of his leg to arrest him , all the time pointing a rifle at his 15 @-@ year @-@ old daughter 's head as she sat on a bedroom floor . At the time , Wotton became one of 17 defendants , all males , charged in the Palm Island riots and was alleged to be the riot ringleader . At the Townsville Magistrate Court on 29 November , Wotton was charged with " arson ( two counts ) , serious assault on police ( three counts ) , wilful damage and riot causing damage " . 
 = = = Out on bail = = = 
 On 6 December , Wotton was released on bail , in part due to being characterised as a " leader and saviour " for the Palm Island community . The bail conditions required Wotton to return to court on 10 March 2007 , and restricted Wotton 's movements , particularly focusing on preventing his attending Doomadgee 's funeral and returning to the north Queensland island . 
 Despite the strict bail conditions , three days later Wotton attended a protest march through Townsville and laid flowers on the steps of the north Queensland city 's police station in memory of Doomadgee . Wotton was being hailed a hero even before Doomadgee 's sister put her arms around Wotton 's neck on 9 December , saying " you 're my warrior " . After a subsequent court hearing , Wotton was allowed to return home to Palm Island in early May 2005 . 
 In November 2006 , four months before his trial where he faced life imprisonment , Wotton become one of six people nominated to run for mayor of the North Queensland Aboriginal community in a December by @-@ election . However , one day before the election , the Supreme Court of Queensland ruled Wotton ineligible to be mayor since the Local Government Act 1993 disqualifies people from elected office in Queensland if they are an undischarged bankrupt and Wotton had previously been bankrupt . 
 = = The trial = = 
 In February 2007 , Wotton was granted a separate trial from his co @-@ accused in the Brisbane District Court since the allegations in the prosecution case against the other co @-@ accused were prejudicial to Wotton 's case . Wotton then pleaded guilty to the charge of rioting . In late March , after Wotton had already applied to withdraw his guilty plea on the advice of his legal representatives ( including his then barrister Marcus <unk> ) , Wotton 's co @-@ accused were acquitted by a jury of rioting causing destruction . Wotton 's application to withdraw his plea was granted by <unk> <unk> on 26 April 2007 . A few days later , Wotton was released on bail with strict conditions and ordered to return in April 2008 to be tried . 
 As Wotton waited for his trial , a man mistaken for being Wotton in September 2007 was attacked from behind while at a urinal in the Rising Sun Hotel . In addition to having his wrist bone shattered and jaw bone fractured , the attackers caused him internal bleeding , head and facial injuries and bruised ribs . 
 After several delays , Wotton 's trial began on 6 October 2008 in the District Court in Brisbane . The trial lasted 18 days , with the jury on 24 October finding Wotton guilty of inciting a riot that resulted in the destruction of the island 's police station , the courthouse and an officer 's residence . Fourteen days later , Wotton was sentenced to seven years in prison , reduced to six years for time already served . His family has no plans to appeal the sentence .

Speakers at a Brisbane rally argued that Wotton should have been given a bravery award for what they saw as standing up to the racist oppression of Palm Islanders .

 Since 2006 , all prisoners and <unk> in Queensland have been prohibited by law ( section 132 of Queensland 's Corrective Services Act , introduced by the Beattie Labor Government ) from speaking to reporters without permission . Thus , for the duration of his imprisonment and parole , Wotton cannot lawfully speak to the media or attend public meetings without prior approval from his parole officer . <unk> Smallwood of the Indigenous Human Rights Committee believes it is designed to muzzle the truth . Terry O 'Gorman , President of the Australian Council for Civil Liberties , has called it ' obnoxious ' . Stewart Levitt , the director of the Black and White Justice Foundation remarked that it was unusual for a public spokesman and former politician to be prohibited from a public meeting . Welcoming Wotton back home , Alf Lacey , mayor of Palm Island , commented that the conditions were excessive . 
 Wotton contested the constitutionality of Queensland 's parole conditions to the High Court of Australia . The Australian constitution contains an implied right of political communication , as is necessary in a representative democracy , plus rights to freedom of association and assembly . The case was heard by the High Court in August 2010 , where Wotton was represented by a team of lawyers including Stewart Levitt and Alison Drayton of Levitt Robinson Solicitors , Ron Merkel QC , assisted by Kristen Walker , Alistair Pound and Ben <unk> . 
 In February 2012 the High Court by majority decision , supported the gag order . The majority judgement applied the test in Lange v ABC . That , 
 1 @.@ does the law effectively burden freedom of communication about government or political matters and 2 @.@ if so , is the law reasonably appropriate and adapted to serve a legitimate end the fulfilment of which is compatible with … responsible government . ( Lange v ABC at footnote 69 . ) 
 and found that , while the legislation did burden Mr Wotton 's freedom of political communication , that burden was applied for a legitimate ends , namely maintenance of law and order .

 = Battle of Kehl ( 1796 ) = 
 During the Battle of Kehl ( 23 – 24 June 1796 ) , a Republican French force under the direction of Jean Charles Abbatucci mounted an amphibious crossing of the Rhine River against a defending force of soldiers from the Swabian Circle . In this action of the War of the First Coalition , the French drove the Swabians from their positions in Kehl and subsequently controlled the bridgehead on both sides of the Rhine . 
 Although separated politically and geographically , the fates of Kehl , a village on the eastern shore of the Rhine in Baden @-@ Durlach , and those of the Alsatian city of Strasbourg , on the western shore , were united by the presence of bridges and a series of gates , fortifications and barrage dams that allowed passage across the river . In the 1790s , the Rhine was wild , unpredictable , and difficult to cross , in some places more than four or more times wider than it is in the twenty @-@ first century , even under non @-@ flood conditions . Its channels and tributaries wound through marsh and meadow and created islands of trees and vegetation that were alternately submerged by floods or exposed during the dry seasons . The fortifications at Kehl and Strasbourg had been constructed by the fortress architect Sébastien le <unk> de Vauban in the seventeenth century . The crossings had been contested before : in 1678 during the French @-@ Dutch war , in 1703 during the War of the Spanish Succession and in 1733 during the War of the Polish Succession . Critical to success of the French plan would be the army 's ability to cross the Rhine at will . Consequently , control of the crossings at Hüningen , near the Swiss city of Basel , and at Kehl , would give them ready access to most of southwestern Germany ; from there , French armies could sweep north , south , or east , depending on their military goal . 
 = = Background = = 
 At the end of the Rhine Campaign of 1795 , the two sides called a truce , which lasted until 20 May 1796 , when the Austrians announced that it would end on 31 May . 
 = = = Terrain = = = 
 The Rhine River flows west along the border between the German states and the Swiss Cantons . The 80 @-@ mile ( 130 km ) stretch between <unk> , by Schaffhausen and Basel , the High Rhine cuts through steep hillsides over a gravel bed ; in such places as the former rapids at Laufenburg , it moved in torrents . A few miles north and east of Basel , the terrain flattens . The Rhine makes a wide , northerly turn , in what is called the Rhine knee , and enters the so @-@ called Rhine ditch ( Rheingraben ) , part of a rift valley bordered by the Black Forest on the east and Vosges Mountains on the west . In 1796 , the plain on both sides of the river , some 19 miles ( 31 km ) wide , was dotted with villages and farms . At both far edges of the flood plain , especially on the eastern side , the old mountains created dark shadows on the horizon . Tributaries cut through the hilly terrain of the Black Forest , creating deep defiles in the mountains . The tributaries then wind in rivulets through the flood plain to the river . 
 The Rhine River itself looked different in the 1790s than it does in the twenty @-@ first century ; the passage from Basel to Iffezheim was " corrected " ( straightened ) between 1817 and 1875 . Between 1927 and 1975 , a canal was constructed to control the water level . In the 1790s , the river was wild and unpredictable , in some places four or more times wider than the twenty @-@ first century incarnation of the river , even under regular conditions . Its channels wound through marsh and meadow , and created islands of trees and vegetation that were periodically submerged by floods . It was <unk> at Kehl , by Strasbourg , and Hüningen , by Basel , where systems of viaducts and causeways made access reliable . 
 = = = Political complications = = = 
 The German @-@ speaking states on the east bank of the Rhine were part of the vast complex of territories in central Europe called the Holy Roman Empire . The considerable number of territories in the Empire included more than 1 @,@ 000 entities . Their size and influence varied , from the <unk> , the little states that covered no more than a few square miles , or included several non @-@ contiguous pieces , to the small and complex territories of the princely Hohenlohe family branches , to such sizable , well @-@ defined territories as the Kingdoms of Bavaria and Prussia . The governance of these many states varied : they included the autonomous free imperial cities , also of different sizes and influence , from the powerful Augsburg to the minuscule Weil der Stadt ; ecclesiastical territories , also of varying sizes and influence , such as the wealthy Abbey of Reichenau and the powerful Archbishopric of Cologne ; and dynastic states such as Württemberg . When viewed on a map , the Empire resembled a " patchwork carpet " . Both the Habsburg domains and Hohenzollern Prussia also included territories outside the Empire . There were also territories completely surrounded by France that belonged to Württemberg , the Archbishopric of Trier , and Hesse @-@ Darmstadt . Among the German @-@ speaking states , the Holy Roman Empire 's administrative and legal mechanisms provided a venue to resolve disputes between peasants and landlords , between jurisdictions , and within jurisdictions . Through the organization of imperial circles , also called <unk> , groups of states consolidated resources and promoted regional and organizational interests , including economic cooperation and military protection . 
 = = = Disposition = = = 
 The armies of the First Coalition included the contingents and the infantry and cavalry of the various states , amounted to about 125 @,@ 000 troops ( including the three autonomous corps ) , a sizable force by eighteenth century standards but a moderate force by the standards of the Revolutionary wars . Archduke Charles , Duke of Teschen and brother of the Holy Roman Emperor , served as commander @-@ in @-@ chief . In total , Charles ’ troops stretched in a line from Switzerland to the North Sea . Habsburg troops comprised the bulk of the army but the thin white line of Habsburg infantry could not cover the territory from Basel to Frankfurt with sufficient depth to resist the pressure of the opposition . Compared to French coverage , Charles had half the number of troops covering a 211 @-@ mile front , stretching from Renchen , near Basel to Bingen . Furthermore , he had concentrated the bulk of his force , commanded by Count Baillet Latour , between Karlsruhe and Darmstadt , where the confluence of the Rhine and the Main made an attack most likely , as it offered a gateway into eastern German states and ultimately to Vienna , with good bridges crossing a relatively well @-@ defined river bank . To the north , Wilhelm von Wartensleben ’ s autonomous corps stretched in a thin line between Mainz and Giessen . 
 An assault into the German states was essential , as far as French commanders understood , not only in terms of war aims , but also in practical terms : the French Directory believed that war should pay for itself , and did not budget for the feeding of its troops . The French citizen ’ s army , created by mass conscription of young men and systematically divested of old men who might have tempered the rash impulses of teenagers and young adults , had already made itself unwelcome throughout France . It was an army entirely dependent for support upon the countryside it occupied for provisions and wages . Until 1796 , wages were paid in the worthless <unk> ( France 's paper currency ) ; after April 1796 , although pay was made in metallic value , wages were still in arrears . Throughout that spring and early summer , the French army was in almost constant mutiny : in May 1796 , in the border town of Zweibrücken , the 74th Demi @-@ brigade revolted . In June , the 17th Demi @-@ brigade was insubordinate ( frequently ) and in the 84th Demi @-@ brigade , two companies rebelled . 
 In spring 1796 , drafts from the free imperial cities , and other imperial estates in the Swabian and Franconian Circles augmented the Habsburg force with perhaps 20 @,@ 000 men at the most . The militias , most of which were Swabian field hands and day laborers drafted for service in the spring of that year , were untrained and unseasoned . As he gathered his army in March and April , it was largely guess work where they should be placed . In particular , Charles did not like to use the militias in any vital location . Consequently , in May and early June , when the French started to mass troops by Mainz and it looked as if the bulk of the French army would cross there — they even engaged the imperial force at Altenkirchen ( 4 June ) and Wetzler and Uckerath ( 15 June ) — Charles felt few qualms placing the 7000 @-@ man Swabian militia at the crossing by Kehl . 
 = = French plans = = 
 The Coalition 's Army of the Lower Rhine counted 90 @,@ 000 troops . The 20 @,@ 000 @-@ man right wing under Duke Ferdinand Frederick Augustus of Württemberg stood on the east bank of the Rhine behind the Sieg River , observing the French bridgehead at Düsseldorf . The garrisons of Mainz Fortress and Ehrenbreitstein Fortress included 10 @,@ 000 more . The remainder held the west bank behind the Nahe River . Dagobert Sigmund von Wurmser , who initially commanded the whole operation , led the 80 @,@ 000 @-@ strong Army of the Upper Rhine . Its right wing occupied Kaiserslautern on the west bank while the left wing under Anton Sztáray , Michael von Fröhlich and Louis Joseph , Prince of Condé guarded the Rhine from Mannheim to Switzerland . The original Austrian strategy was to capture Trier and to use their position on the Rhine 's west bank to strike at each of the French armies in turn . However , after news arrived in Vienna of Napoleon Bonaparte 's successes in northern Italy , Wurmser was sent to Italy with 25 @,@ 000 reinforcements ; the Aulic Council gave Archduke Charles command over both Austrian armies and ordered him to hold his ground . 
 On the French side , the 80 @,@ 000 @-@ man Army of Sambre @-@ et @-@ Meuse held the west bank of the Rhine down to the Nahe and then southwest to Sankt Wendel . On this army 's left flank , Jean Baptiste Kléber had 22 @,@ 000 troops entrenched at Düsseldorf . The right wing of the Army of the Rhine and Moselle , under Jean Victor Moreau 's command , was positioned east of the Rhine from Hüningen ( on the border with the French provinces , Switzerland , and the German states ) northward , with its center along the Queich River near Landau and its left wing extended west toward Saarbrücken . Pierre Marie Barthélemy Ferino commanded Moreau 's right wing at Hüningen , Louis Desaix commanded the center and Laurent Gouvion Saint @-@ Cyr directed the left wing and included two divisions commanded by Guillaume Philibert Duhesme , and Alexandre Camille Taponier . Ferino 's wing included three infantry and cavalry divisions under François Antoine Louis Bourcier , and general of division Augustin Tuncq , and Henri François Delaborde . Desaix 's command included three divisions led by Michel de Beaupuy , Antoine Guillaume Delmas and Charles Antoine Xaintrailles . 
 The French plan called for its two armies to press against the flanks of the Coalition 's northern armies in the German states while simultaneously a third army approached Vienna through Italy . Specifically , Jean @-@ Baptiste Jourdan 's army would push south from Düsseldorf , hopefully drawing troops and attention toward themselves , which would allow Moreau ’ s army an easier crossing of the Rhine . If all went according to plan , Jourdan ’ s army could feint toward Mannheim , which would force Charles to <unk> his troops . Once Charles moved the mass of his army to the north , Moreau ’ s army , which early in the year had been stationed by Speyer , would move swiftly to the south to Strasbourg . From there , they could cross the river at Kehl , which was guarded by 7 @,@ 000 @-@ man inexperienced and lightly trained militia — troops recruited that spring from the Swabian circle polities . In the south , by Basel , Ferino ’ s column was to move speedily across the river and advanced up the Rhine along the Swiss and German shoreline , toward Lake Constance and spread into the southern end of the Black Forest . Ideally , this would encircle and trap Charles and his army as the left wing of Moreau 's army swung behind him , and as Jourdan 's force cut off his flank with Wartensleben 's autonomous corps . 
 = = Feint and a dual @-@ pronged attack = = 
 Everything went according to the French plan , at least for six weeks . On 4 June 1796 , 11 @,@ 000 soldiers of the Army of the Sambre @-@ et @-@ Meuse , commanded by François Lefebvre , pushed back a 6 @,@ 500 @-@ man Austrian force at Altenkirchen . On 6 June , the French placed Ehrenbreitstein fortress under siege . At Wetzlar on the Lahn , Lefebvre ran into Charles ' concentration of 36 @,@ 000 Austrians on 15 June . Casualties were light on both sides , but Jourdan pulled back to <unk> while Kléber retreated toward Düsseldorf . Pál Kray , commanding 30 @,@ 000 , rushed into battle with Kléber 's 24 @,@ 000 at Uckerath , east of Bonn on 19 June , prompting the French to continue withdrawal to the north . The actions confirmed to Charles that Jourdan intended to cross at the mid @-@ Rhine , and he quickly moved sufficient of his force into place to address this threat . 
 Responding to the French feint , Charles committed most of his forces on the middle and northern Rhine , leaving only the Swabian militia at the Kehl @-@ Strasbourg crossing . Once he did so , though , Moreau executed a forced march with most his army and arrived at Strasburg before Charles realized he had left Speyer . To accomplish this march rapidly , Moreau left his artillery behind ; infantry and cavalry move more swiftly . On 20 June , his troops assaulted the forward posts between Strasbourg and the river , overwhelming the pickets there ; the militia withdrew to Kehl , leaving behind their cannons , which solved part of Moreau 's artillery problem . 
 Early in the morning on 24 June , Moreau and 3 @,@ 000 men embarked in small boats and landed on the islands in the river between Strasbourg and the fortress at Kehl . They dislodged the imperial pickets there who , as one commentator observed " had not the time or address to destroy the bridges which communicate with the right [ west ] bank of the Rhine ; and the progress of the French remaining unimpeded , they crossed the river and suddenly attacked the redoubts of Kehl . " Once the French had controlled the fortifications of Strasbourg and the river islands , Moreau ’ s advance guard , as many as 10 @,@ 000 French skirmishers , some from the 3rd and 16th Demi @-@ brigades commanded by the 24 @-@ year @-@ old General Abbatucci , swarmed across the Kehl bridge and fell upon the several hundred Swabian pickets guarding the crossing . Once the skirmishers had done their jobs , Charles Mathieu Isidore Decaen 's and Joseph de Montrichard 's infantry of 27 @,@ 000 infantry and 3 @,@ 000 cavalry followed and secured the bridge . The Swabians were hopelessly outnumbered and could not be reinforced . Most of Charles ' Army of the Rhine was stationed further north , by Mannheim , where the river was easier to cross , but too far to support the smaller force at Kehl . The only troops within relative easy distance were the Prince Condé ’ s émigré army at Freiburg and Karl Aloys zu Fürstenberg 's force in Rastatt , neither of which could reach Kehl in time . 
 A second attack , simultaneous with the crossing at Kehl , occurred at Hüningen near Basel . After crossing unopposed , Ferino advanced in a dual @-@ prong east along the German shore of the Rhine with the 16th and 50th demi @-@ brigades , the 68th and 50th and 68th line infantry , and six squadrons of cavalry that included the 3rd and 7th Hussars and the 10th Dragoons . 
 Within a day , Moreau had four divisions across the river at Kehl and another three at Hüningen . <unk> thrust out of Kehl , the Swabian contingent reformed at Renchen on the 28th , where Count Sztáray and Prince von <unk> managed to pull the shattered force together and unite the disorganized Swabians with their own 2 @,@ 000 troops . On 5 July , the two armies met again at Rastatt . There , under command of Fürstenberg , the Swabians managed to hold the city until the 19 @,@ 000 French troops turned both flanks and Fürstenberg opted for a strategic withdrawal . Ferino hurried eastward along the shore of the Rhine , to approach Charles ' force from the rear and cut him off from Bavaria ; Bourcier 's division swung to the north , along the east side of the mountains , hoping to separate the Condé ’ s émigrés from the main force . Either division presented a danger of flanking the entire Coalition force , either Bourcier 's on the west side of the Black Forest , or Ferino 's on the east side . The Condé marched north and joined with Fürstenberg and the Swabians at Rastatt . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 The immediate personnel losses seemed minor : at Kehl , the French lost about 150 killed , missing or wounded . The Swabian militia lost 700 , plus 14 guns and 22 ammunition wagons . Immediately , the French set about securing their defensive position by establishing a pontoon bridge between Kehl and Strasbourg , which allowed Moreau to send his cavalry and captured artillery across the river . 
 Strategic losses seemed far greater . The French army 's ability to cross the Rhine at will gave them an advantage . Charles could not move much of his army away from Mannheim or Karlsruhe , where the French had also formed across the river ; loss of the crossings at Hüningen , near the Swiss city of Basel , and the crossing at Kehl , near the Alsatian city of Strasbourg , guaranteed the French ready @-@ access to most of southwestern Germany . From there , Moreau 's troops could fan out over the flood plain around Kehl to prevent any approach from <unk> or Offenburg . 
 To avoid Ferino 's flanking maneuver , Charles executed an orderly withdrawal in four columns through the Black Forest , across the Upper Danube valley , and toward Bavaria , trying to maintain consistent contact with all flanks as each column withdrew through the Black Forest and the Upper Danube . By mid @-@ July , the column to which the Swabians were attached encamped near Stuttgart . The third column , which included the Condé ’ s Corps , retreated through Waldsee to Stockach , and , eventually Ravensburg . The fourth Austrian column , the smallest ( three battalions and four squadrons ) commanded by Ludwig Wolff de la Marselle , retreated the length of the Bodensee ’ s northern shore , via Überlingen , Meersburg , Buchhorn , and the Austrian city of Bregenz . 
 The subsequent territorial losses were significant . Moreau 's attack forced Charles to withdraw far enough into Bavaria to align his northern flank in a roughly perpendicular line ( north to south ) with Wartensleben 's autonomous corps . This array protected the Danube valley and denied the French access to Vienna . His own front would prevent Moreau from flanking Wartensleben from the south ; similarly , Wartensleben 's flank would prevent Jourdan from encircling his own force from the north . Together , he and Wartensleben could resist the French onslaught . However , in the course of this withdrawal , he abandoned most of the Swabian Circle to the French occupation . At the end of July , eight thousand of Charles ' men under command of Fröhlich executed a dawn attack on the Swabian camp at Biberach , disarmed the remaining three thousand Swabian troops , and impounded their weapons . The Swabian Circle successfully negotiated with the French for neutrality ; during negotiations , there was considerable discussion over how the Swabians would hand over their weapons to the French , but it was moot : the weapons had already been taken by Fröhlich . As Charles withdrew further east , the neutral zone expanded , eventually encompassing most of southern German states and the Ernestine Duchies . 
 The situation reversed when Charles and Wartensleben 's forces reunited to defeat Jourdan 's army at the battles of Amberg , Würzburg and 2nd Altenkirchen . On 18 September , an Austrian division under Feldmarschall @-@ Leutnant Petrasch stormed the Rhine bridgehead at Kehl , but a French counterattack drove them out . Even though the French still held the crossing between Kehl and Strasbourg , Petrasch 's Austrians controlled the territory leading to the crossing . After battles at Emmendingen ( 19 October ) and Schliengen ( 24 October ) , Moreau withdrew his troops south to Hüningen . Once safe on French soil , the French refused to part with Kehl or Hüningen , leading to over 100 days of siege at both locations .

 Stephen Dana Schilling ( born July 21 , 1988 ) is a former American football offensive guard . He was included on the 2009 preseason watchlist for the Lombardi Award . He had previously been a two @-@ time Associated Press first @-@ team Class 3A All @-@ state selection in Washington for the Bellevue High School Wolverines football team where he played on three state champion teams . 
 Born and raised in Bellevue , Washington , Schilling grew up playing basketball until high school . In high school , he was a member of the three @-@ time state champion team . He became a star offensive lineman who was a standout Seattle athlete as his high school won its third consecutive state championship in his junior year . He won numerous all @-@ area and all @-@ state honors as a junior and a senior and was highly touted on the national level . He was selected to play in the U.S. Army All @-@ American Bowl and as one of the nominees for Parade All @-@ American Player of the Year . After being highly recruited by several top college football programs and narrowing his list to several Pacific @-@ 10 Conference football teams and University of Michigan , he decided to attend Michigan . 
 At Michigan , he redshirted as a true Freshman and then started the following year . When the team transitioned from head coach Lloyd Carr to Rich Rodriguez during his redshirt sophomore season , he became one of the few experienced players to endure the change . He has since anchored the offensive line composed of less experienced players . He was honored as the 2008 Michigan Wolverines football team 's best offensive lineman as a redshirt sophomore before being nationally recognized as a Lombardi Award watchlist candidate in 2009 . He was selected as a 2009 and 2010 All @-@ Big Ten Conference honorable mention . He was a 2010 Outland Trophy watch list candidate . 
 He was drafted by the San Diego Chargers in the sixth round of the 2011 NFL Draft . He began his NFL career on the practice squad . He was activated prior to week 8 of the 2011 NFL Season ( his rookie year ) , and played in several subsequent games for the team . He has also played for the Seattle Seahawks . He announced his retirement on April 2 , 2015 .

 When Schilling was young , he was too large to play organized football with kids his own age because Bellevue 's youth leagues were regulated by weight @-@ age limits , which caused him to take up basketball instead . Schilling says that his true love was basketball and that he would probably not have experimented with football , but the coach of the basketball team resigned right before his freshman season . During the summer prior to his freshman year , Schilling first visited the Bellevue High School weight room where he noticed the intensity and camaraderie . He eventually became a three @-@ year starter for the football team . As a sophomore , Schilling was part of the Bellevue championship football team whose season extended long enough to interfere with him participating in the early part of the basketball season as a sophomore . The championship , which came as a result of a ten @-@ game winning streak to close the season , made the Bellevue Wolverines three @-@ time Class 3A state champions . On September 4 , 2004 , as a junior , he helped Bellevue end the high school football record 151 @-@ game winning streak by De La Salle High School in front of 24 @,@ 987 at the second annual Emerald City Kickoff Classic at Qwest Field by a 39 – 20 score . 
 Early in his junior season , he got his first scholarship offer from the University of Washington . The 6 @-@ foot @-@ 5 @-@ inch ( 1 @.@ 96 m ) 280 @-@ pound ( 130 kg ) Schilling , who wore # 52 in high school , played on both the offensive line and defensive line .

During the season , Schilling was known for his training habits . At the end of the football season , he was selected to All @-@ State teams both by the Associated Press and The Seattle Times . During his junior basketball season , he was a solid contributor to team scoring and rebounding . He averaged 10 @.@ 6 points / game during his junior season . At the end of his junior year he was named the number 25 football prospect in the nation and the number three offensive tackle by Rivals.com. In July prior to his senior season , he was included in a Reebok Western All @-@ American list in Sports Illustrated . 
 Early in his senior season , running a Wing T offense , Bellevue again defeated a highly regarded California high school in a game at Qwest Field . On September 16 , 2009 , they defeated the Long Beach Polytechnic High School , who had been ranked number three by the USA Today . At the end of September , he left a game in the second quarter with what was thought to be a separated shoulder . He spent the following three weeks on the sidelines with a sore shoulder . In his October 28 return , Bellevue snapped their 30 @-@ game winning streak . During the first ten games of the season , Bellevue averaged 11 yards per rush . In the eleventh game , the team lost in the state quarterfinals . Schilling ended his career having played for three state champions .

 Schilling did not arrive in Ann Arbor , Michigan in time for 2006 spring practice like some of his classmates . Just prior to the 2006 NCAA Division I FBS football season opener for the 2006 Michigan Wolverines football team , Schilling was diagnosed with mononucleosis . This caused him to miss several weeks of practice . In late October , he decided to redshirt and have a second shoulder surgery after having missed weeks of practice and lost lots of weight . As part of his transition from a Wing T offense that rarely passed , Schilling had to work on improving his pass blocking . 
 He earned the starting right tackle position in a battle with Mark Ortmann and Perry Dorrestein at the start of the 2007 NCAA Division I FBS football season for the 2007 Michigan Wolverines football team . He was the starter on September 1 during the opening game loss to two @-@ time defending FCS champion Appalachian State Mountaineers . After starting the first five games at right tackle , Schilling moved to right guard for two games ( Eastern Michigan and Purdue ) as a result of injuries to some of his other teammates . He was expected to start a third game at right guard , but he was returned to right tackle . During practice , he had to spend time at both positions after the injuries . Although he did not start at guard until the sixth game , he played guard in the opener after Jeremy Ciulla got injured . Although , he had to stretch beyond his past experiences and natural position , he was able to seek fifth @-@ year seniors Jake Long and Adam Kraus as mentors . The 2007 rivalry game against Ohio State was a prime example of his lack of experience with pass blocking . He had difficulties pass blocking against Vernon Gholston , who posted three quarterback sacks . 
 With the departure of Mike Hart , Mario Manningham , Adrian Arrington , Jake Long , Chad Henne , and Adam Kraus to the National Football League and Justin Boren 's defection from the team , the 2008 Michigan Wolverines football team entered the season for new head coach Rich Rodriguez with only three returning offensive starters : Schilling , tight end Carson Butler and fullback Mark <unk> . Backup quarterback Ryan Mallett transferred and two senior offensive linemen ( Jeremy Ciulla and Alex Mitchell ) declined to use their fifth years of eligibility . Schilling was virtually the only returning offensive lineman with any experience . Aside from Schilling , the projected opening game starting offensive line had a total of three career starts . Offensive line injuries continued to affect the lineup through the early part of the season with David Molk ( center ) , David Moosman ( right guard ) and Schilling ( right tackle ) being the only players to start each of the first four games . Even Schilling was a bit injured , causing him to be handled delicately during practice . In the first five games , the team used four different starting offensive line combinations due to injuries . For much of the season , Rodriguez ' offense started six freshmen . By the seventh game the line returned to full strength and used the opening day lineup . In the week before the last game of the season against Ohio State , Schilling injured his knee in practice . As a result , he did not play in the final game . Nonetheless , he was honored by the team at the end of the season as the team 's best offensive lineman . The young offense had all but one of its starters returning for the following season . 
 As a fourth @-@ year junior , Schilling entered the 2009 NCAA Division I FBS football season opener with the second most career starts ( 26 ) on the 2009 Michigan Wolverines football team behind punter Zoltan Mesko ( 38 ) . He switched to left guard from right tackle in 2009 . In the Ohio State game , he was notable for losing a shoe during the game and trying to play without it . He was recognized as an honorable mention 2009 All @-@ Big Ten Conference selection by both the coaches and the media . 
 As a fifth @-@ year senior , Stephen Schilling was <unk> for the Outland Trophy award for lineman . He was also , elected co @-@ captain and participated in a season long fanmail program where he responded to Michigan fan questions made by email and on Facebook every Friday . Following the Big Ten Conference season , he was selected as an honorable mention All @-@ Conference selection by both the coaches and the media . Following the season , he participated in the 2011 Senior Bowl . During Schilling 's senior season , Denard Robinson had a record @-@ setting season on offense : he broke Drew Brees ' Big Ten single @-@ season total offense record of 4 @,@ 189 yards . Robinson fell 116 yards short of Tim Biakabutuka 's Michigan school record of 1 @,@ 818 rushing yards . However , he led the conference in both total offense and rushing yards per game .

 " Krusty Gets Busted " is the twelfth episode of The Simpsons ' first season . It originally aired on the Fox network in the United States on April 29 , 1990 . The episode was written by Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky , and directed by Brad Bird . In the episode , Krusty the Clown is convicted of armed robbery of the Kwik @-@ E @-@ Mart . Convinced that Krusty has been framed , Bart and Lisa investigate the incident and discover that Krusty 's sidekick , Sideshow Bob , was the culprit . 
 This episode marks the first full @-@ fledged appearance of Kent Brockman , and Kelsey Grammer makes his first guest appearance on the show as the voice of Sideshow Bob . The episode was well received by critics , and it was the highest rated show on the Fox Network the week it aired . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Homer stops by the Kwik @-@ E @-@ Mart on the way home from work , and witnesses a robbery committed by a masked clown resembling Krusty . He identifies the clown as Krusty to the police , and Krusty is arrested , upsetting Bart , who considers him to be his idol . During his trial the next day , Krusty is revealed to be illiterate . After being called out to the stand , Homer points out Krusty as the robber , and he is convicted and sentenced to jail . The community then gathers up in a public burning as they burn up all of Krusty 's merchandise . Krusty 's sidekick Sideshow Bob becomes the new host of his show and making it a more educational program , while retaining the popular Itchy & Scratchy cartoons . Still refusing to accept that his hero could have committed the crime , Bart enlists the help of a reluctant Lisa and they set out to prove Krusty 's innocence . 
 At the scene of the crime , Lisa deduces Krusty could not have been the robber because the robber used the microwave not suitable for those with a pacemaker ( which Krusty was revealed earlier to have ) , and reading a magazine at the magazine rack . She accepts Bart 's theory that he may have been framed . She asks Bart if there was anyone who had motives to see Krusty gone and he suggests they ask Sideshow Bob because he may identify any known enemies . Bart and Lisa go to Sideshow Bob for his help in finding out if Krusty had any known enemies who wanted him gone , but are given tickets to his show . At the live broadcast , Bart is invited up on stage with Bob , where he points out the facts regarding the microwave and magazine , which Bob dismisses . When Bob says he has " some mighty big shoes to fill " , Bart remembers how Homer stepped on the robber 's shoes that made him scream in pain . When he watched Krusty head to trial , he was wearing normal shoes much too small to hold feet as large as the robber 's . Bart knew that despite wearing clown shoes all the time , Krusty never would have felt Homer stepping on them due to his small feet . It was then he realized that Sideshow Bob is the real robber , since he had the most to gain in Krusty 's downfall and has large feet . Bart proves his evidence by hitting Bob 's feet with a comedy mallet on live television . The police , having watched the show , realized they wrongfully put Krusty in jail for a crime he did not commit and head down the studio to arrest Sideshow Bob . 
 Arrested and exposed , Bob confesses that the reason he framed Krusty was out of frustration for constantly being on the receiving end of the clown 's humiliating gags . He gives a grudging kudos to the Simpson kids before being carted off to jail . Bob warns criminals not to underestimate children in spite of their innocent looks , because they were smart enough to foil him and can do the same to them . The charges against Krusty are dropped and he regains the trust of the community . Homer then apologizes to Krusty for fingering him in court , and Krusty thanks Bart for standing up for the truth and sticking to his convictions , and a picture is taken of the two shaking hands ( which Bart later hangs in his bedroom , refilled with Krusty decor ) . 
 = = Production = = 
 Director Brad Bird wanted to open the episode with a close up of Krusty 's face . The staff liked the idea and he then suggested that all three acts of the episode , defined by the placement of the commercial breaks , should begin with a close up shot . Act one begins with Krusty 's face introducing the audience at his show , act two begins with Krusty 's face being locked up behind bars , and act three begins with Sideshow Bob 's face on a big poster . Krusty 's character is based on a television clown from Portland , Oregon , called Rusty Nails , whom The Simpsons creator Matt Groening watched while growing up in Portland . The original teleplay , written by Jay Kogen and Wallace Wolodarsky , was 78 pages long and many scenes had to be cut . One scene that had to be cut down was the scene where Patty and Selma show the slideshow of their vacation ; it originally contained images of them being detained for bringing heroin into America . 
 Sideshow Bob 's first major appearance on The Simpsons was in this episode , but he first appeared in the season one episode " The Telltale Head " . In that appearance , his design was more simple and his hair was round in shape . However near the end of the episode he appears with his more familiar hairstyle . Bob 's design was updated for " Krusty Gets Busted " , and the animators tried to redo his scenes in " The Telltale Head " with the re @-@ design , but did not have enough time . The script for " Krusty Gets Busted " called for James Earl Jones to voice Bob , but the producers instead went with Kelsey Grammer , a cast member on Cheers at the time . Kent Brockman and Scott Christian make their first appearances on The Simpsons in this episode . 
 = = Cultural references = = 
 Chief Wiggum 's order during the suspect line @-@ up to " send in the clowns " is an allusion to the Stephen Sondheim song " Send in the Clowns " from the 1973 musical A Little Night Music . The Sondheim musical took its name from Mozart 's Serenade No. 13 for strings in G major , Eine kleine Nachtmusik , which is the theme tune to Sideshow Bob 's show . The close up shot of Krusty 's face behind bars in the beginning of act two is a reference of the closing credit motif of the British television series The Prisoner from the 1960s . The background music in that scene resembles the theme of the television series Mission : Impossible at one point . The line " The Day the Laughter Died " , shown during the newscast , is a reference to the Andrew Dice Clay album released the previous month . Sideshow Bob is reading The Man in the Iron Mask by Alexander Dumas to the studio audience . The song " Ev 'ry Time We Say Goodbye " by Cole Porter is featured in the episode . Following Sideshow Bob 's arrest , he mutters : " I would 've gotten away with it too , if it weren 't for these meddling kids . " , which is a reference to a catchphrase from Hanna @-@ Barbera 's animated television show Scooby @-@ Doo .

" In a DVD review of the first season , David B. Grelck gave the episode a rating of 3 / 5 . Colin Jacobson at DVD Movie Guide said in a review that " throughout the episode we found great material ; it really seemed clear that the show was starting to turn into the piece we now know and love . It ’ s hard for me to relate any deficiencies " and added that " almost every Bob episode offers a lot of fun , and this episode started that trend in fine style . "

 = 2008 Georgia sugar refinery explosion = 
 The 2008 Georgia sugar refinery explosion was an industrial disaster that occurred on February 7 , 2008 in Port Wentworth , Georgia , United States . 14 people were killed and 40 injured when a dust explosion occurred at a sugar refinery owned by Imperial Sugar . Dust explosions had been an issue of concern among United States authorities since three fatal accidents in 2003 , with efforts made to improve safety and reduce the risk of recurrence . 
 The refinery was large and old , featuring outdated construction methods , and these factors are believed to have contributed to the fire 's severity . The origin of the explosion has been narrowed down to the center of the factory . It was believed to have occurred in a basement beneath storage silos . Investigations conducted by the Department of Justice ruled out deliberate criminal activity in 2013 . 
 As a result of the disaster , new safety legislation was proposed . The local economy declined because the factory was closed down . Imperial intended to rebuild it and return to production by the end of 2008 , with replacement buildings to be completed by summer the following year . Some victims filed legal suits for damages against the owner and the company hired to clean up the refinery . Imperial said that the explosion was the main reason for a major loss in the first quarter of 2008 . 
 The U.S. Chemical Safety Board released its report on the incident in September 2009 , saying that the explosion had been " entirely preventable . " Investigations by Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) and the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives also concluded that sugar dust was the fuel for an explosion that could have been prevented . By September 2010 , 44 suits had been filed in Chatham County Court against Imperial Sugar and / or its cleaning contractor . Eighteen have been settled . 
 = = Background = = 
 The sugar refinery was a four @-@ story structure on the bank of the Savannah River . Imperial Sugar , based in Sugar Land , Texas , had bought the refinery and its brand name in 1997 from a previous local owner . Known since construction as the Dixie Crystals refinery , it was the main employer in the town of 3 @,@ 500 prior to the disaster . 
 The refinery was constructed in 1916 by 400 people who were moved from Louisiana specifically for the purpose , and opened the following year . Imperial bought the refinery together with Savannah Foods to form part of a national supply and distribution network to meet demand from businesses such as <unk> Wiggly , General Mills and Wal @-@ Mart . The refinery sat on a 160 acres ( 0 @.@ 65 km2 ; 0 @.@ 25 sq mi ) site and was spread across 872 @,@ 000 square feet ( 81 @,@ 000 m2 ) of it . This network was the second largest in the US . Workers described the factory as antiquated , with much of the machinery dating back more than 28 years . They said the site was kept operating because it had good access to rail and shipping links for transport . 
 In the last full fiscal year before the disaster , which ended on September 30 , 2007 , the facility refined 14 @.@ 51 million hundredweight of sugar , 9 % of the nation 's requirements , compared to Imperial 's Gramercy , Louisiana , refinery , which refined 11 @.@ 08 million hundredweight of sugar in the same time period . 90 % of the raw sugar supplied to the facility came from overseas in that year , and the company expected the " vast majority " to come in from abroad in the year of the explosion as well . 
 In the time leading up to the explosion , Imperial Sugar had run into financial difficulties . In the fiscal year ending September 30 , 2007 , sales fell 8 % , while profits were down 50 % from that year 's fourth quarter , and stock also down by half since April 2007 . The last two annual reports by Imperial before the explosion said that any damage to the facility at Port Wentworth would " have a material effect on the company 's business , financial condition , results of operations and cash flows . " 
 Meanwhile , in 2004 the Chemical Safety and Hazard Investigation Board conducted a study into the risks presented by dust explosions after three fatal accidents in the year before . The West Pharmaceutical Services explosion killed six persons , the CTA Acoustics fiberglass insulation manufacturing plant explosion killed seven , and the Hayes <unk> automotive parts plant explosion killed one , prompting the report . Their report showed that between 1980 and 2005 , there had been 281 explosions involving combustible dust , resulting in 119 deaths and 718 injuries . The Board found that dust explosions posed a severe risk and made a number of recommendations to the Occupational Safety and Health Administration . These had been partly implemented by 2008 . The Board continued to be concerned about the potential for further fatal accidents up until Imperial 's refinery was the scene of an explosion . 
 = = Explosion and emergency response = = 
 The explosion occurred at 7 : 00 p.m. local time in what was initially believed to be a room where sugar was bagged by workers . Witnesses from across the Savannah River in South Carolina reported seeing flames shoot up several stories high . There were 112 employees on @-@ site at the time . The explosion occurred in the center of the refinery , where bagging and storage facilities were fed completed product by a network of elevators and conveyor belts . Many of the buildings here were six to eight stories high with narrow gaps in between . 
 Ambulances responded to the scene from across twelve counties , and firefighters from three . The United States Coast Guard closed off the river in the area , and a firefighting tug boat was used to douse the resulting fire from the river . A helicopter was used to search the river for anyone who may have been thrown into it by the blast . Refinery workers were brought in to assist with search and rescue operations , as emergency services personnel were unfamiliar with the plant 's layout . Red Cross worker Joyce Baker was among the first to arrive at the scene . She reported that it was like " walking into hell " , with some of the men she treated having " no skin at all " , while others had skin " just dripping off them . " 
 The Georgia Emergency Management Agency alerted local hospitals to prepare for up to 100 casualties . A doctor at nearby Memorial Health hospital described patients arriving at an emergency triage as varying in condition from suffering minor burns to their hands to having received 80 @-@ 90 % burns , with many in critical condition , and one with 95 % burns . The victims ' ages ranged from 18 to 50 . Many victims were placed in artificial comas because they were on life support systems . Eight were transported by helicopter to the specialized Joseph M. Still Burn Center in Augusta , Georgia , about an hour away . Five of those injured later died there while receiving treatment . 
 A church close to the refinery was used as a point for families seeking information on relatives employed at the facility . So many people turned up that police requested that each family send only one representative . At the close of the day of the explosion , six people were missing , with no confirmed deaths . Overnight , several deep @-@ seated fires were uncovered and firefighting continued the next day . 
 Most of the three @-@ mile ( 5 km ) stretch of river that had previously been closed was reopened without restriction , although a patrol remained in place to enforce a safety zone . The river restrictions delayed one outgoing vessel and two incoming ones . There was also a minor oil spill originating from equipment at the refinery 's unoccupied and rarely used dock . 
 The explosion seriously weakened the structure of the facility , leaving it highly unstable , and there was extensive smoke damage . The packaging area was totally destroyed and in all , 12 % of the refinery was demolished by the explosion . Removal of debris began the day after the accident , with assistance from structural engineers . The six missing persons were all found dead that day , three of them in tunnels running beneath the factory . The final death toll was thirteen . It was the first major shutdown of a US sugar refinery since American Sugar Refining Inc . ' s Domino Sugar shut down its plant in <unk> , Louisiana in the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina . 
 By February 14 , 2008 , the worst of the fire had been extinguished . The 100 foot ( 30 m ) sugar storage silos remained alight despite attempts to put the fire out by dousing them with thousands of gallons of water from a helicopter . Specialist crews and equipment were called in to complete work tackling the smoldering , molten sugar in the silos . At this time , seven bodies had been recovered , and an eighth person had died in the hospital . 
 = = Investigation = = 
 The location of the explosion was quickly established as a building used to store refined sugar prior to packaging it and two of three 100 foot ( 30 m ) tall , 18 inches ( 46 cm ) thick reinforced concrete storage silos adjacent to it , as pictured . According to Imperial Sugar CEO John <unk> , the accumulated sugar dust likely acted like gunpowder . <unk> , who was in the plant at the time of the explosion , survived only because he was protected by a firewall . Heavy equipment had to be used to shore up the partially collapsed structure before firefighters could enter it to search for victims . Within 24 hours , the explosive substance was identified as sugar dust . 
 Federal investigations by the Occupational Safety and Health Administration ( OSHA ) and the U.S. Chemical Safety Board ( CSB ) were launched , and they interviewed witnesses , checked documentation , and conducted on @-@ scene examination of the plant . OSHA arrived within two hours and the CSB within 48 hours . Other brief investigations were conducted by state firefighters and police and the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms , and Explosives , but these were ended quickly after confirming there was no evidence of the explosion and fire having been deliberately started . In a press conference held on February 17 , 2008 , one of the six members of the CSB team said that the explosion showed the ongoing risk from dust explosions despite their report highlighting the matter in 2004 . 
 Investigators were unable to enter the silos as OSHA ruled them to be too hazardous after the explosion . They were only able to access the area after the silos were demolished . By the time this took place , four months after the disaster , investigators believed that the explosion started in a basement area beneath the silos , from which sugar was fed up to the packaging building on conveyor belts . The factory 's outdated construction materials and methods are believed to have contributed to the severity of the blaze . The ceiling was of wooden tongue and groove design . The creosote used throughout was known as “ fat lighter , ” because of the fire risk it posed . Interviews of Imperial Sugar employees conducted by OSHA uncovered a lack of training , as 40 of the workers reported never receiving training on how to exit the building in an emergency . Only five employees recalled having a fire drill .

 Imperial 's refinery in Louisiana was shut down by the company six weeks after the Port Wentworth disaster , over fears a similar explosion would occur there . It was kept from operating for more than a week . OSHA fined Imperial $ 36 @,@ 000 over safety legislation violations at that plant . 
 The Georgia plant 's 371 workers continued to receive payment from Imperial , and 275 were rehired to assist with cleanup and demolition of parts of the refinery that could not be salvaged . Work began on April 18 , 2008 after Imperial 's board confirmed their intention to rebuild . The plan was for the plant to return to sugar refining by the end of 2008 . Demolition of the sugar silos was conducted on June 24 , 2008 with a wrecking ball . A replacement packaging building and new sugar silos were intended to be completed by summer 2009 . During demolition , 2 @,@ 800 @,@ 000 pounds ( 1 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 kg ) of fire @-@ hardened sugar were recovered from one silo , and another 500 @,@ 000 pounds ( 230 @,@ 000 kg ) from a second . The company hoped to recycle the product for ethanol production . In the first quarter of 2008 , Imperial posted a $ 15 @.@ 5 million loss , which they said was primarily due to the explosion . Port Wentworth suffered an economic depression after the accident , with local businesses losing many customers . Imperial Sugar was purchased in 2012 by the Louis Dreyfus Group . 
 = = = Reports from OSHA and CSB = = = 
 Within a month of the accident , OSHA , fearing that relevant employers may be unaware their facilities presented a risk of dust explosions , sent a letter to 30 @,@ 000 employees to alert them to the danger of a similar explosion occurring . OSHA also proposed the Combustible Dust Explosion and Fire Prevention Act of 2008 , a new bill aimed at introducing regulations to reduce the risk of dust explosions . The bill passed the United States House of Representatives but never passed the United States Senate . In 2009 OSHA began developing a federal standard for combustible dust . Congress introduced a bill in 2013 to require OSHA to issue an interim standard based on the voluntary combustible standard set by National Fire Protection Association 
 In March 2008 Raquel Islas , a female worker whose arms were burnt , sued Savannah company Stokes Contracting , who had a contract to clean the factory . In April 2008 the widow of <unk> Harvey also sued Stokes , as well as Savannah Foods . It was a wholly owned subsidiary after Imperial bought them out and the factory was still owned in its name . In August , 2008 Malcolm Frazier succumbed to his injuries , bringing the total number of deaths to fourteen . Frazier , who suffered burns over 85 % percent of his body , died at the Joseph M. Still Burn Center , where he had remained since the explosion . 
 On February 7 , 2009 , a monument honoring the people lost in the explosion was dedicated at Legacy Park , on the grounds of the Port Wentworth plant . OSHA fined Imperial $ 8 @.@ 8 million in May , 2010 after citing the company for 211 violations at the Port Wentworth plant and a plant in Gramercy , Louisiana . After settlement negotiations the company agreed to pay $ 6 million , while admitting no fault . 
 The Chemical Safety Board released its report in September 2009 , saying the explosion had been " entirely preventable . " It noted that the sugar industry had been aware of the risk of dust explosions since 1926 . Specifically , internal company memorandums by managers in 1967 expressed their concern about the potential of explosions from sugar dust . Imperial Sugar had recently made construction changes that enabled the accumulation of sugar dust . It had never practiced evacuation procedures , and the lack of emergency lighting meant that people were confined to dark hallways and tunnels at the time of the explosions . 
 = = = Legal issues = = = 
 Victims of the disaster continued to file claims against Imperial Sugar and its cleaning contractor . By September 2010 , 44 civil suits had been filed in Chatham County Court in relation to the explosion , and eighteen had been settled . The state appeals court rejected an effort by defendants ' attorneys for a pre @-@ trial appeal in two related cases in an effort to limit damages . In 2011 Lawrence Manker , Jr . , an Imperial Sugar worker who underwent 70 surgeries for burns covering 85 % of his body after the plant explosion , settled his lawsuit with the company for an undisclosed amount . He was the last victim to leave a hospital burn unit . 
 The Department of Justice requested that Ed Tarver , U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Georgia , pursue criminal prosecution against Imperial Sugar and its executives . OSHA cited Imperial with 124 safety violations , finding that the company acted with " plain indifference to , or intentional disregard for , employee safety and health . " Tarver said there was not enough evidence of intentional disregard or plain indifference to bring criminal charges against Imperial . He also cited a lack of federal criminal laws specifically related to safety in the sugar industry as a reason for his decision .
