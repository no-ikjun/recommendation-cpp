 Crawford 's obituary in The Times described him as one of the best young players to play cricket in England and said : " Although he invariably played in glasses , he was a most attractive player to watch , an aggressive hitter of the ball and a dangerous medium @-@ paced bowler " . Wisden described him as a " hard @-@ hitting batsman " , and said he played mainly from the front foot . He had an orthodox batting technique , moved his feet well to get to the ball , and played very straight . Herbie Collins , who played with Crawford in Australia , described one of his innings as " a hurricane innings , full of classical shots charged with dynamite . " 
 As a bowler , Crawford 's technique was also orthodox , although he was unusual in using his second and third fingers to spin the ball — most bowlers used their first and second . His bowling pace varied from fast to medium , and he spun the ball so much that his fingers snapped audibly as he released it . An accurate bowler , it was difficult for batsmen to score runs against him . Crawford could swing the ball away from the bat , but his most effective delivery was his off break : Clem Hill stated that Crawford could make the ball turn several inches , despite the hard pitches prevalent in Australia when he played there . John Arlott described him as " the schoolboy genius who turned on Australian pitches where no one else deviated from straight " . In 1937 , Herbie Collins wrote , at a time when Wally Hammond was considered to be the world 's leading all @-@ rounder , that " people who have seen both men consider [ Crawford ] a better all @-@ rounder " . 
 Commenting on the interruption of Crawford 's career by his dispute with Surrey , Neville Cardus wrote : " His break with Surrey must be regarded as a sad deprivation of fame and pleasure to himself , and a grievous loss to the annals of English cricket . It is as certain as anything in a man 's life can be confidently postulated , that had he continued to play in English county cricket ... he would have taken his place amongst the select company of England 's captains . " The Times commented : " It was one of the great disappointments of English cricket in the first quarter of this century that his outstanding promise was never fully realized . " Hart observes that Crawford 's on @-@ field successes were many up to 1909 but after that , his career effectively stalled during his absence from English cricket . Hart notes Crawford 's " capacity to get on the scoreboard and up establishment noses . He could turn games around and agreements over , antagonise the powerful , endear himself to the young and those young enough at heart to care to characterise great personal performances as ' heroic ' " . He concludes that Crawford spent the last 40 years of his life " in comparative sporting obscurity " . No @-@ one on the Surrey committee ever expressed regret at what had happened , and Leveson Gower did not mention the affair in his autobiography . 
 = Chew Stoke = 
 Chew Stoke is a small village and civil parish in the Chew Valley , in Somerset , England , about 8 miles ( 13 km ) south of Bristol . It is at the northern edge of the Mendip Hills , a region designated by the United Kingdom as an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty , and is within the Bristol / Bath green belt . The parish includes the hamlet of Breach Hill , which is approximately 2 miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) southwest of Chew Stoke itself . 
 Chew Stoke has a long history , as shown by the number and range of its heritage @-@ listed buildings . The village is at the northern end of Chew Valley Lake , which was created in the 1950s , close to a dam , pumping station , sailing club , and fishing lodge . A tributary of the River Chew , which rises in Strode , runs through the village . 
 The population of 991 is served by one shop , two public houses , a primary school and a bowling club . Together with Chew Magna , it forms the ward of Chew Valley North in the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset . Chew Valley School and its associated leisure centre are less than a mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) from Chew Stoke . The village has some areas of light industry but is largely agricultural ; many residents commute to nearby cities for employment .

 Archaeological excavations carried out between 1953 and 1955 by Philip Rahtz and Ernest Greenfield from the Ministry of Works found evidence of extensive human occupation of the area . Consecutive habitation , spanning thousands of years from the Upper Palaeolithic , Mesolithic , and Neolithic periods ( Old , Middle , and New Stone Age ) , to the Bronze and Iron Ages had left numerous artefacts behind . Discoveries have included stone knives , flint blades , and the head of a mace , along with buildings and graves . 
 = = = Romano @-@ Celtic temple = = = 
 Chew Stoke is the site of a Romano @-@ Celtic double @-@ octagonal temple , possibly dedicated to the god Mercury . The temple , on Pagans Hill , was excavated by Philip Rahtz between 1949 and 1951 . It consisted of an inner wall , which formed the sanctuary , surrounded by an outer wall forming an ambulatory , or covered walkway 56 @.@ 5 feet ( 17 @.@ 2 m ) across . It was first built in the late 3rd century but was twice rebuilt , finally collapsing in the 5th century . The positioning of the temple on what is now known as Pagans Hill may seem apt , but there is no evidence for any link between the existence of the temple and the naming of the road . 
 = = = Middle Ages = = = 
 During the Middle Ages , farming was the most important activity in the area , and farming , both arable and dairy , continues today . There were also orchards producing fruits such as apples , pears , and plums . Evidence exists of lime kilns , used in the production of mortar for the construction of local churches . 
 In the Domesday Book of 1086 , Chew Stoke was listed as <unk> , and was recorded as belonging to Gilbert Fitz @-@ <unk> . He conspired with the Duke of Normandy against King William Rufus , and subsequently , all his lands were seized . The next recorded owner was Lord Beauchamp of <unk> . He became " lord of the manor " when the earls of Gloucester , with hereditary rights to Chew Stoke , surrendered them to him . According to Stephen Robinson , the author of Somerset Place Names , the village was then known as Chew <unk> , suggesting that it may have had some military potential . The name " Stoke " , from the old English <unk> , meaning a stockade , may support that idea . 
 The parish was part of the hundred of Chew .

 The Bilbie family of bell founders and clockmakers lived and worked in Chew Stoke for more than 200 years , from the late 17th century until the 19th century . They produced more than 1 @,@ 350 church bells , which were hung in churches all over the West Country . Their oldest surviving bell , cast in 1698 , is still giving good service in the local St Andrew 's Church . The earliest Bilbie clocks date from 1724 and are highly prized . They are mostly longcase clocks , the cheapest with 30 @-@ hour movements in modest oak cases , but some have high quality eight @-@ day movements with additional features , such as showing the high tide at Bristol docks . These latter clocks were fitted into quality cabinet maker cases and command high prices . 
 = = = Recent history = = = 
 In the 20th century , Chew Stoke expanded slightly with the influx of residents from the Chew Valley Lake area . These new residents were moved to Chew Stoke when the lake was created in the 1950s . In World War II , 42 children and three teachers , who had been evacuated from <unk> school in London , were accommodated in the village . On 10 July 1968 , torrential rainfall , with 175 millimetres ( 7 in ) falling in 18 hours on Chew Stoke , double the area 's average rainfall for the whole of July , led to widespread flooding in the Chew Valley , and water reached the first floor of many buildings . The damage in Chew Stoke was not as severe as in some of the surrounding villages , such as Pensford ; however , fears that the Chew Valley Lake dam would be breached caused considerable anxiety . 
 On 4 February 2001 , Princess Anne opened the Rural Housing Trust development at <unk> Close . Each year , over a weekend in September ( usually the first ) , a " Harvest Home " is held with horse and pet shows , bands , a funfair , and other entertainments . The Harvest Home was cancelled in 1997 as a mark of respect following the death of Princess Diana in the previous week . The Radford 's factory site , where refrigeration equipment was formerly manufactured , was identified as a brownfield site suitable for residential development in the 2002 Draft Local Plan of Bath and North East Somerset . That plan has generated controversy about balancing land use to meet residential , social , and employment needs . 
 During November 2012 a series of floods affected many parts of Britain . On 22 November a man died after his car was washed down a flooded brook in Chew Stoke and trapped against a small bridge . 
 = = Governance = = 
 Chew Stoke has its own nine @-@ member parish council with responsibility for local issues , including setting an annual precept ( local rate ) to cover the council 's operating costs and producing annual accounts for public scrutiny . The parish council evaluates local planning applications and works with the local police , district council officers , and neighbourhood watch groups on matters of crime , security , and traffic . The council 's role also includes initiating projects for the maintenance and repair of parish facilities , as well as consulting with the district council on the maintenance , repair , and improvement of highways , drainage , footpaths , public transport , and street cleaning . Conservation matters ( including trees and listed buildings ) and environmental issues are also the responsibility of the council . 
 The village is part of the ward of Chew Valley North in the unitary authority of Bath and North East Somerset , which has the wider responsibility for providing services such as education , refuse collection , and tourism . The ward is currently represented by Councillor Malcolm Hannay , a member of the Conservative Party . It is also part of the North East Somerset , and part of the South West England constituency of the European Parliament . 
 The police service is provided by Avon and Somerset Constabulary with two Community Support Officer and one police officer covering the wider Chew Valley area . The Avon Fire and Rescue Service have a fire station at Chew Magna . 
 = = Geography = = 
 The area of Chew Stoke is surrounded by arable land and dairy farms on the floor of the Chew Valley . It is located along the Strode Brook tributary of the River Chew , on the northwest side of the Chew Valley Lake . While much of the area has been cleared for farming , trees line the tributary and many of the roads . The village is built along the main thoroughfare , Bristol Road , which runs northeast to southwest . An older centre is located along Pilgrims Way , which loops onto Bristol Road and features an old stone packhorse bridge — now pedestrianised — and a 1950s Irish bridge , used as a ford in winter . The bridge is 7 feet 6 inches ( 2 @.@ 29 m ) wide and has 36 inches ( 910 mm ) parapets . Houses line both of these roads , with residential cul @-@ de @-@ sacs and lanes extending from them . 
 Chew Stoke is approximately 10 miles ( 16 km ) south of Bristol , 15 miles ( 24 km ) from Bath , and 9 miles ( 14 km ) from Keynsham . It is 1 @.@ 3 miles ( 2 @.@ 1 km ) south of Chew Magna on the B3130 road that joins the A37 and A38 . The A368 crosses the valley west of the lake . The " Chew Valley Explorer " bus route 672 / 674 , running from Bristol Bus Station to Cheddar , provides public transport access . This service is operated by CT coaches and <unk> and subsidised by Bath and North East Somerset council . In 2002 , a 1 @.@ 9 @-@ mile ( 3 @.@ 1 km ) cycle route , the Chew Lake West Green Route , was opened around the western part of the lake from Chew Stoke . It forms part of the Padstow to Bristol West Country Way , National Cycle Network Route 3 . It has all @-@ weather surfacing , providing a smooth off @-@ road facility for ramblers , mobility @-@ challenged visitors , and cyclists of all abilities . Funding was provided by Bath and North East Somerset Council , with the support of Sustrans and the Chew Valley Recreational Trail Association . The minor roads around the lake are also frequently used by cyclists . Bristol Airport is approximately 10 miles ( 16 km ) away , and the nearest train stations are Keynsham , Bath Spa , and Bristol Temple Meads .

 The population of Chew Stoke , according to the census of 1801 , was 517 . This number increased slowly during the 19th century to a maximum of 819 but fell to around 600 by the end of the century . The population remained fairly stable until World War II . During the latter half of the 20th century , the population of the village rose to 905 people . Data for 1801 – 1971 is available at Britain Through Time ; data for 1971 – 2001 is available from BANES The 2001 Census gives detailed information about the Chew Valley North ward , which includes both Chew Magna and Chew Stoke . The ward had 2 @,@ 307 residents , living in 911 households , with an average age of 42 @.@ 3 years . Of those , 77 % of residents described their health as ' good ' , 21 % of 16- to 74 @-@ year @-@ olds had no work qualifications , and the area had an unemployment rate of 1 @.@ 3 % . In the Index of Multiple Deprivation 2004 , the ward was ranked at 26 @,@ 243 out of 32 @,@ 482 wards in England , where 1 was the most deprived and 32 @,@ 482 the least deprived .

 St Andrews Church , a Grade II * listed building on the outskirts of Chew Stoke , was constructed in the 15th century and underwent extensive renovation in 1862 . The inside of the church is decorated with 156 angels in wood and stone , and the church includes a tower with an unusual <unk> on the staircase turret . In the tower hang bells cast by the Bilbie family . The reconstructed Moreton Cross in the churchyard was moved there when Chew Valley Lake flooded , and the base of the cross shaft , about 80 feet ( 24 m ) southwest of the tower , is thought to date from the 14th century and is itself a Grade II * listed building , as is the Webb monument in the churchyard . The churchyard gate , at the southeast entrance , bears a lamp provided by public subscription to commemorate Queen Victoria 's Jubilee of 1897 and is a Grade II listed structure . 
 In the church are bronze plaques commemorating the eleven local people who died in World War I and the six who were killed in World War II . There is also a stained glass window showing a saint with a sword standing on a snake , and crossed flags commemorating those from World War II . There is also a memorial plaque to the local Bilbie family of bell founders and clockmakers inside the church , and just inside the porch , on the left of the church door , is a stone figure holding an anchor , which was moved to the church from Walley Court with the flooding of the lake . There is an unconfirmed story that this was given to the Gilbert family , then living at the court , by Queen Elizabeth I. 
 = = = Rectory = = = 
 The Rectory , at the end of Church Lane , opposite the church hall , is believed to have been built in 1529 by Sir John Barry , rector 1524 – 46 . It has since undergone substantial renovations , including the addition of a clock tower for the Rev. W.P. Wait and further alterations <unk> for Rev. J. Ellershaw . The clock tower has since been removed . The building has an ornate south front with carvings of shields bearing the coat of arms of the St Loe family , who were once chief landowners in the area , alone or impaled with arms of <unk> , <unk> , de la <unk> , and Malet . It is Grade II * listed .

 As with many cities and towns in the United Kingdom , the age of a number of the buildings in Chew Stoke , including the church , school , and several houses , reflects the long history of the village . For example , Chew Stoke School has approximately 170 pupils between 4 and 11 years old . After the age of 11 , most pupils attend Chew Valley School . These two buildings were built in 1858 on the site of a former charity school founded in 1718 . The architect was S.B. Gabriel of Bristol . Additional classrooms were built in 1926 , and further alterations and extensions were carried out in 1970 . 
 An obelisk on Breach Hill Lane , dating from the early @-@ to @-@ mid @-@ 19th century , is said to have been built as a waterworks marker . It has a square limestone plinth about 3 feet ( 1 m ) high . The obelisk is about 32 feet ( 10 m ) high with a pyramidal top and small opening at the top on two sides . 
 The importance of farming is reflected in the age of many of the farmhouses . Manor Farm , on Scot Lane ( not to be confused with at least two other Manor Farms in the locality ) is thought to date from 1495 and , as such , is probably the oldest building in the village . Presently ( 2007 ) occupied by Mr and Mrs Slater ; the building has recently ( 2002 ) undergone a sympathetic extension to incorporate an old semi @-@ derelict barn onto the main house for use as a garage and workshop . Mr Slater , a Chartered Engineer , is interested in bringing the art of clock making back to the village . Rookery Farmhouse , in Breach Hill Lane , is dated at 1720 , with later 18th century additions to either side of the central rear wing . An attached stable , 20 feet ( 6 m ) northeast of the farmhouse , is also a Grade II listed building . School Farmhouse , in School Lane , dates from the late 17th century and has a studded oak door in the side of the house . Wallis Farmhouse , farther along School Lane , is dated at 1782 . Yew Tree Farmhouse , one of the oldest buildings in the area , is a cruck built farmhouse of which there are very few in North Somerset . It was included in the dendrochronology project carried out by the Somerset Vernacular Building Research Group 1996 – 1998 and the crucks gave a felling date of 1386 , the house has been extensively altered and added to over later centuries . North Hill Farmhouse also has 15th century origins . <unk> Farmhouse dates from the 17th century . Fairseat Farmhouse is from the 18th century and includes a plaque recording that John Wesley preached at the house on 10 September 1790 . In August of that year , Fairseat Farmhouse was " registered among the records of this County as a House set apart for the worship of God and religious exercise for Protestant Dissenters . " At that time the house belonged to Anna Maria Griffon . In the garden is a large evergreen oak ( Ilex ) which measured 98 feet ( 30 m ) across until half of it broke away in a gale in 1976 . 
 The Methodist Chapel was built in 1815 / 16 after religious services had been established at Fairseat Farm , and the chapel was rebuilt in the late 19th century with limestone walls with stone dressings and a slate hipped roof with brick eaves stacks and <unk> . 
 In the hamlet of Stoke <unk> , which is south of the main village , there is a 19th @-@ century milestone inscribed " 8 miles to Bristol " that also has listed status .

 Chew Stoke Church of England Voluntary Aided Primary School serves the village itself and surrounding villages in the Chew Valley . It is a Church of England voluntary controlled school linked with the St. Andrew 's parish church . It has about 170 pupils between 4 and 11 years old . After the age of 11 , most pupils attend Chew Valley School . 
 The school was founded as a charity in 1718 . Its original buildings were demolished in 1858 and replaced with new ones to designs by S.B. Gabriel that are now Grade II listed . The school bell was donated by the Bilbie family of bell founders based in the village . Additional classrooms were built in 1926 , and further alterations and extensions were built in 1970 . 
 = Tropical Storm Gabrielle ( 2007 ) = 
 Tropical Storm Gabrielle was a short @-@ lived tropical cyclone that passed over North Carolina before tracking out to sea . The seventh named storm of the 2007 Atlantic hurricane season , Gabrielle developed as a subtropical cyclone on September 8 about 385 miles ( 625 km ) southeast of Cape Lookout , North Carolina . Unfavorable wind shear impacted the storm for much of its duration , although a temporary decrease in the shear allowed the cyclone to become a tropical storm . On September 9 , Gabrielle made landfall at Cape Lookout National Seashore in the Outer Banks of North Carolina with winds of 60 mph ( 90 km / h ) . Turning to the northeast , the storm quickly weakened and dissipated on September 11 . 
 In advance of the storm , tropical cyclone watches and warnings were issued for coastal areas , while rescue teams and the U.S. Coast Guard were put on standby . The storm dropped heavy rainfall near its immediate landfall location but little precipitation elsewhere . Along the coast of North Carolina , high waves , rip currents , and storm surge were reported . Slight localized flooding was reported . Gusty winds also occurred , though no wind damage was reported . Along the coast of Florida , rough surf drowned one person . Overall damage was minor . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A cold front moved off the southeast coast of the United States on September 1 . Gradually decaying , the front degenerated into an area of cloudiness and showers just east of the Georgia coast on September 2 . Tracking eastward , a weak low pressure area developed the next day . It slowly became better organized as its motion became erratic , and by late on September 4 the convection had become concentrated to the east of the center . On September 5 , a Hurricane Hunters flight indicated the system had not acquired the characteristics of a tropical or subtropical cyclone . Interaction with an upper @-@ level trough resulted in moderate wind shear which suppressed further development , and by September 6 the thunderstorm activity lost much organization . Upper @-@ level winds became increasingly favorable , allowing the convection to concentrate about halfway between North Carolina and Bermuda . With a deep @-@ layer ridge to its north , the system turned to a steady west @-@ northwest track . A reconnaissance aircraft flight late on September 7 reported a very elongated center , with peak flight winds of 55 mph ( 90 km / h ) about 100 miles ( 160 km ) northeast of the center . Subsequent to the flight , the center became slightly better organized , and based on the large wind field and the presence of an upper @-@ level low to its west @-@ southwest , the National Hurricane Center classified the system as Subtropical Storm Gabrielle early on September 8 while located about 385 miles ( 625 km ) southeast of Cape Lookout , North Carolina . 
 Upon becoming a subtropical cyclone , Gabrielle was located in an area of cooler air to its north , dry air to its south and west , southerly wind shear , and cooler water temperatures along its path . Despite these unfavorable conditions , a curved convective band developed in its northern and western quadrants , and the circulation became better defined . Subsequently , the rainbands in its northeastern quadrant dissipated , leaving the well @-@ defined center far removed from the convection . By later that day , the circulation began to become more involved with the remaining convection . Based on evidence of a weak warm @-@ core , the system was re @-@ designated as Tropical Storm Gabrielle late on September 8 about 185 miles ( 300 km ) southeast of Cape Lookout , North Carolina . 
 Vertical wind shear decreased as the storm passed over the Gulf Stream , allowing a strong convective burst to develop near the center . As it approached the coast of North Carolina , the center re @-@ developed within the deep convection underneath the mid @-@ level circulation , although increased northerly wind shear displaced the center of Gabrielle to the north of the thunderstorm activity . Based on reports from Hurricane Hunters , it is estimated Gabrielle moved ashore at Cape Lookout National Seashore at 1530 UTC on September 9 with winds of 60 mph ( 95 km / h ) , though due to the shear the strongest winds remained offshore . Tracking around the ridge over the western Atlantic , the storm turned to the north and north @-@ northeast , emerging into the ocean near Kill Devil Hills , North Carolina early on September 10 as a poorly organized system with convection far to the south of the center . Gabrielle weakened to a tropical depression shortly thereafter , and maintained scattered convection despite unfavorable wind shear as it tracked along the northern portion of the Gulf Stream . By midday on September 11 , the circulation had become ill @-@ defined and elongated ; failing to meet the criteria of a tropical cyclone , the National Hurricane Center declared Gabrielle dissipating well to the south of Nova Scotia . By early the next day , the remnants of Gabrielle were absorbed by an approaching cold front . 
 = = Preparations = = 
 Upon becoming a subtropical cyclone , the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm watch from Edisto Beach , South Carolina to Oregon Inlet in North Carolina , including the Pamlico Sound . As the storm approached the coast , the watch south of Cape Fear , North Carolina was discontinued , and a tropical storm warning was issued from Surf City , North Carolina northward to the North Carolina – Virginia state border ; a watch was also issued northward to Cape Charles Light on the Delmarva Peninsula , and to New Point Comfort on the western shore of the Chesapeake Bay , which was upgraded to a warning the next day . 
 Prior to the arrival of the storm , the National Park Service closed visitor centers and campgrounds along the Outer Banks . For about 12 hours , the ferry between Hatteras and Ocracoke was closed . North Carolina Governor Mike Easley put rescue teams and the National Guard on standby . Residents and tourists were advised to secure loose objects , and to remain indoors . As the storm 's effects were expected to be minor , no evacuations were ordered . On Ocracoke Island , boats were hauled out . The threat of the storm forced the cancellation of a fishing tournament at Atlantic Beach , which resulted in effects to the local economy . 
 Initially , uncertainty in Gabrielle 's track led the National Hurricane Center 's five @-@ day track forecast cone to include the Mid @-@ Atlantic , southeastern New York , and southern New England . Forecasters predicted rough surf and rip currents , prompting the Coast Guard to perform preparations in the Northeastern United States . On Cape Cod , Massachusetts , an HU @-@ 25 Falcon jet flew along the coastline , broadcasting storm advisories to offshore vessels . A Coast Guard patrol boat was deployed offshore for search and rescue . Boaters and mariners were advised to exercise caution , and were told to " make safe decisions " . However , the storm passed well to the south with little effect . 
 = = Impact = = 
 Rough surf from Gabrielle along the coast of Florida drowned one surfer and forced the rescue of 200 swimmers . Officials at New Smyrna Beach estimated 6 to 9 feet ( 1 @.@ 8 to 2 @.@ 7 m ) seas . By early on September 9 , the outer rainbands began affecting southeastern North Carolina . Sustained winds of tropical storm force from the storm occurred along coastline , unofficially reaching 44 miles per hour ( 71 km / h ) at Frisco . Wind gusts were stronger , unofficially reaching 61 miles per hour ( 98 km / h ) at Ocracoke . Along the coast , rough surf was reported , and waves reached 10 to 12 feet ( 3 @.@ 0 to 3 @.@ 7 m ) . Rip currents caused numerous swimmers to be rescued by lifeguards . Heavy rainfall from the storm was confined to near its immediate landfall location , peaking at 9 @.@ 03 inches ( 229 mm ) at a station 7 @.@ 2 miles ( 12 km ) to the east @-@ northeast of Newport ; other areas reported 4 to 8 inches ( 0 @.@ 10 to 0 @.@ 20 m ) . Two offshore ships observed tropical storm @-@ force winds , though the reports were considered to be overestimated . 
 In some locations , the rainfall led to flooding , which prevented farmers from harvesting crops . Elsewhere throughout the state , the storm failed to relieve severe drought conditions as it was initially hoped to . The passage of the storm left a portion of North Carolina Highway 12 on Hatteras Island closed for three hours , briefly flooding part of the road . Streets in Morehead City and Beaufort were closed , and several homes and businesses suffered minor flood damage . In Carteret County , the flooding inflicted $ 5 @,@ 000 ( 2007 USD ) in property damage . Storm surge was fairly light along the coast , peaking at 3 feet ( 0 @.@ 91 m ) above normal at Hatteras Island . Overall damage in the state was minor , including minor beach erosion and some flooded streets . No fatalities were reported .

It spans 430 @.@ 80 miles ( 693 @.@ 31 km ) across the state of Washington , and is the only numbered highway to span the entire state from west to east , starting near the Pacific Ocean , and crossing the Idaho state line near Clarkston . It crosses the Cascade Range over White Pass , south of Mount Rainier National Park . Portions of it are concurrent with Interstate 5 ( I @-@ 5 ) and Interstate 82 ( I @-@ 82 ) , although the majority of the route does not parallel any Interstate Highway . 
 Although US 12 was not extended into Washington until 1967 , portions of it have been part of Washington 's state highway system since as early as 1905 . The last part of the highway to open was over White Pass in 1951 , although it was added to the state highway system by the legislature in 1931 . Most of the route ( except for the approximately 160 miles ( 260 km ) between Elma and Naches ) had been part of the U.S. Highway System since its inception in 1926 as part of U.S. Route 410 . The portion between Napavine and Grand Mound was also designated a U.S. Highway in 1926 as part of U.S. Route 99 .

 U.S. Route 12 begins in Aberdeen on a pair of one @-@ way streets , Heron Street eastbound and Wishkah Street westbound . At its western terminus , US 12 intersects US 101 , which goes west along Heron and Wishkah , and south across Grays Harbor to the south side of Aberdeen . The eastbound and westbound lanes of US 12 merge just east of the Wishkah River , near the Grays Harbor Historic Seaport . US 12 then leaves Aberdeen to the east along the Chehalis River , where it passes through the towns of Central Park and Montesano . Between Aberdeen and Elma , US 12 is four lanes wide . The majority of the highway in Washington , however , is a rural two @-@ lane road . 
 In the town of Elma , US 12 exits the highway at a diamond interchange . From there , the main highway continues east to Olympia as State Route 8 ( SR 8 ) , and US 12 heads southeast towards Oakville and Rochester . East of Oakville , US 12 runs north of the Chehalis Indian Reservation . It then continues east through the town of Rochester , and interchanges with I @-@ 5 at exit 88 in the town of Grand Mound . 
 US 12 continues south concurrent with I @-@ 5 through Chehalis and Centralia before exiting again at exit 68 south of Napavine . The highway then heads east along the Cowlitz River and passes through the town of Mossyrock , where it intersects SR 122 . East of Mossyrock , US 12 runs just north of Mossyrock Dam and Riffe Lake . In the town of Morton , it intersects SR 7 , which heads north to Tacoma . It then ascends the Cascade Range , passing south of Mount Rainier , and intersects SR 123 , which serves the Stevens Canyon entrance of Mount Rainier National Park . Twelve miles ( 19 km ) east of this intersection , US 12 crosses the Cascades over White Pass at an elevation of 4 @,@ 500 feet ( 1 @,@ 372 m ) . White Pass is the only crossing of the Cascades open year @-@ round between I @-@ 90 over Snoqualmie Pass and SR 14 through the Columbia River Gorge . 
 After it descends the mountains , US 12 intersects SR 410 ( formerly US 410 ) west of Naches , which serves Chinook Pass , Cayuse Pass , and the White River entrance of Mount Rainier National Park . East of Naches , US 12 widens once again to four lanes as it approaches the city of Yakima . There , it has an interchange with I @-@ 82 and US 97 at exit 31 . US 12 then runs concurrently with I @-@ 82 , bypassing the towns of Toppenish and Prosser and paralleling the Yakima River , until exit 102 near the Tri @-@ Cities . At exit 102 , it meets the western terminus of Interstate 182 . US 12 and I @-@ 182 then run concurrently east over Goose Gap and through the Tri @-@ Cites . In Pasco , I @-@ 182 ends , and US 12 intersects US 395 . 
 US 12 then heads south to the town of Wallula , intersecting US 730 , then east to Walla Walla , north to Dodge , and east to Clarkston before crossing the Idaho state line over the Snake River just outside Lewiston . US 12 through Walla Walla consists of a four @-@ lane bypass , also known as Inland Empire Highway . The alignment of US 12 through Walla Walla County passes by a number of historical landmarks , such as Whitman Mission and Fort Walla Walla . 
 = = History = = 
 The Washington State Legislature created the State Highway Board in 1905 and appropriated funds to construct — but not maintain — twelve highways in sparsely settled areas of the state . Main highways in more populated areas would continue to be entirely under county control , though sometimes built with 50 % state aid . Six of these highways were east @-@ west crossings of the Cascades , including one in the corridor currently served by U.S. Route 12 — State Road 5 , the Cowlitz Pass State Road , climbing east from a point near <unk> via the Cowlitz River , over Cowlitz Pass , and down towards Yakima . A 1907 amendment renamed State Road 5 the Cowlitz @-@ Natches Road , moved the Cascade crossing north to Carlton Pass , and defined the portion east of the pass to follow the <unk> River and Naches River to a point near Naches . East of the mouth of the American River , this replaced part of State Road 1 ( North Yakima and Natches State Road ) , which had been defined in 1897 to cross the Cascades north of Chinook Pass and included in the 1905 appropriations . 
 Under a 1909 law , the State Highway Board surveyed a connected network of proposed state roads . Included was a westerly extension of SR 5 via Chehalis to South Bend and Aberdeen and an easterly extension to Pullman . A route from Yakima southeast and east via the Tri @-@ Cities to Idaho was also surveyed , mostly as an extension of State Road 8 ( Columbia River Road ) . The legislature added most of these routes to the state highway system in 1913 , when they formed a two @-@ tiered system of primary and secondary roads . Primary roads were completely controlled by the state , including maintenance , and received only names , while secondary roads kept their numbers and county maintenance . The National Park Highway replaced State Road 5 west of Riffe , and extended as surveyed to and beyond South Bend , and the McClellan Pass Highway replaced State Road 1 and continued via State Road 5 to Yakima . The majority of the route from Yakima via Connell to Pullman was not added at that time ; it was finally taken over in 1937 as Secondary State Highways 11A and 11B . Only the route via the Tri @-@ Cities , forming part of the Inland Empire Highway , continued from Yakima to Idaho . East of Pomeroy , the original survey had curved south , using State Road 16 to near the Oregon state line ; this was bypassed by the 1913 designation , which instead continued directly east to Clarkston . Unlike the earlier state roads , these primary roads mostly followed existing passable county roads . The incomplete roadway between Riffe and the American River remained as part of secondary State Road 5 , and the legislature designated the surveyed route from the National Park Highway near Raymond north to Aberdeen as secondary State Road 20 in 1915 . 
 A 1923 restructuring of the system re @-@ assigned numbers to almost all the primary state highways . State Road 5 became a primary route and was greatly expanded , taking over the entire McClellan Pass Highway and the National Park Highway east of the Pacific Highway . The former secondary State Road 5 was realigned starting from near Packwood , heading north instead of east , alongside the <unk> River to the old McClellan Pass Highway at Cayuse Pass , west of the summit of the Cascades . The new State Road 5 , named the National Park Highway System , now included four roads in the vicinity of Mount Rainier National Park , but as the road across the Cascades at Chinook Pass was not yet built , these roads did not connect with each other . Also included in this numbering was the designation of the Inland Empire Highway , including Yakima to Clarkston , as State Road 3 . In 1925 , a spur was added to State Road 9 — the Olympic Highway , looping around the Olympic Peninsula — connecting Elma to the Pacific Highway at Grand Mound , and creating a shortcut between the Cowlitz River route and Aberdeen . The Olympic Highway from Elma west to Aberdeen had been added to the state highway system in 1905 west of and 1913 east of Montesano . 
 As part of the U.S. Highway system laid out in 1925 and finalized in late 1926 , U.S. Route 410 connected Aberdeen with Clarkston , following the Olympic Highway ( State Road 9 ) to Olympia , the Pacific Highway ( State Road 1 ) — concurrent with US 99 — to Tacoma , the National Park Highway System ( State Road 5 ) to Yakima , and the Inland Empire Highway ( State Road 3 ) to Clarkston . This differed from present US 12 between Elma and Naches in that it followed the route through Olympia and Tacoma rather than along the Cowlitz River . However , despite being part of the state highway system since 1897 , US 410 's crossing of the Cascades , the first between the Columbia River Gorge and Snoqualmie Pass , was not opened to traffic until 1931 . A shortcut from near Packwood east across White Pass to Naches , very close to the original plan for the east half of State Road 5 , was added to the state highway system in 1931 as another branch of the highway . The roadway between Packwood and Cayuse Pass , added to the state highway system on a different alignment in 1905 , was finally completed in 1940 , and the White Pass Highway was dedicated on August 12 , 1951 , opening a shortcut between southwest Washington and Yakima . 
 When the U.S. Highways were first established in 1926 , US 12 ended in Miles City , Montana , and most of US 12 's current routing in Washington was followed by US 410 . U.S. Route 12 was extended westward in stages ; an extension to Lewiston , Idaho , was approved on June 19 , 1962 . At various times in the early 1960s , the states of Idaho , Washington , and Oregon submitted plans for further westward extension to the American Association of State Highway Officials ( AASHO ) to either Vancouver , Washington or Boardman , Oregon — or , a plan submitted in 1963 had the highway going only as far as Pasco — but all of these plans were rejected . Washington introduced a new system of sign route numbers in 1964 . While US 410 was still signed as such , present US 12 became State Route 8 between US 410 at Elma and US 99 / I @-@ 5 at Grand Mound and State Route 14 between US 99 / I @-@ 5 at Chehalis and US 410 at Naches . The extension of US 12 to Aberdeen was finally approved on June 20 , 1967 , with US 12 taking over much of US 410 's former routing . However , where US 410 had crossed the Cascades at Chinook Pass , US 12 used the all @-@ weather White Pass , replacing SR 8 and SR 14 . Signs were changed in late December 1967 , and the bypassed segments of US 410 became a new SR 8 between Elma and Olympia , and SR 410 between Tacoma and Naches .

 " Live Like We 're Dying " is a song written by Danny O 'Donoghue , Andrew Frampton , Mark Sheehan , and Steve Kipner . It appeared as a bonus track on The Script 's self @-@ titled debut studio album , as well as a B @-@ side for some of the album 's singles . It is better known for being performed by American recording artist Kris Allen . The song serves as the lead single from his self @-@ titled major label debut album . It was released for digital download on September 21 , 2009 . 
 The song received positive reviews , peaking at eighteen in the United States , and also charting on other U.S. charts , including the top ten of the Pop Songs . It also charted abroad in Canada and New Zealand . The song 's accompanying music video , which takes place in a desert and features a countdown clock in conjunction with the song 's meaning , was also received warmly , and according to critics , was an end to the low @-@ budget , storyline @-@ centered , debut music videos from previous American Idol alumni . 
 = = Background = = 
 The song was originally recorded by Irish band the The Script as a bonus track for the Japanese release of their self @-@ titled debut album and a B @-@ side track for their debut single " We Cry " in Australia , Finland , Great Britain , Ireland , New Zealand , Sweden , and Switzerland . 
 In an interview with MTV News , Allen stated that the song had been earmarked as his album 's potential single since he won American Idol back in May 2009 . Allen stated , " [ The song ] was actually one that we had listened to really early on , and we kind of just fell in love with it . Everyone did . " When an interview for his cover story shared with , Idol runner @-@ up , Adam Lambert , Allen explained , " It 's a song that has a really good message @-@ that we only have so much time , let 's make the most of it . It 's definitely got one of the choruses where I can picture people rolling down the windows of their cars and singing along to it . " 
 After the success of the single , in an interview with Entertainment Weekly , Allen said , 
 " It took a while , but it ’ s done really incredible . It exceeded all my expectations anyway . To be honest , I was a little worried when it first came out and it wasn ’ t doing great . But I think it ’ s just about working hard and getting people to hear the song , and then everyone started believing in it a little bit more . I remember getting a text from Keith Urban saying ' I ’ m not gonna lie : The first time I heard that song I wasn ’ t crazy about it . But after a couple listens , I really , really like it . ' And I mean , I think that ’ s how everybody felt about the song . And I think that ’ s a testament to a good song . You don ’ t have to love ‘ em the first time you hear ‘ em . It grew on people .

 " Live Like We 're Dying " is described to be in a " moderate pop rock " groove , and consisting of " <unk> " guitar playing . The song has been referred to as " danceable " , and the chorus as " grooving " and " syncopated " . It is written in the key of C major and Allen 's vocals span from G3 to A4 . The song contains inspirational lyrics , as Allen gives a " muscular " and " engaged " vocal performance , and delivers the lines in a rhythmic fashion . According to Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly , the song contains new @-@ age sentiments . 
 = = Critical reception = = 
 Bill Lamb of About.com praised the song for being an excellent first single , calling it " possibly the best first post @-@ American Idol single yet by an American Idol champion " and stating that it " could appeal to a massive audience " . He also applauded the song 's " outstanding , inspirational lyrics " and Allen 's vocal performance . Entertainment Weekly ' ' s Michael Slezak called the song " a future smash hit " and described it as " downright verbose – packing in some sweet , new @-@ age @-@ y sentiments about existing in the moment , living without regret , and saying ' I love you ' early and often to the people in our lives " . He stated that rather than being cliché the song 's lyrics are " winningly inspirational thanks to the conviction in Kris ’ vocals " . Yahoo ! News described it as " impressive " and felt that Allen 's version of the song " improves on the unreleased version with a nuanced vocal and a nimble , rhythmic delivery " . Monica Herrera of Billboard said that Allen " improves " the Script 's version " with a nuanced vocal and a nimble , rhythmic delivery " . Herrera also stated that " Allen still seems " emboldened by the risks he took on Idol " and that his fans " should be feeling the same after hearing the first track from his November 17 debut . " 
 James Montgomery of MTV News said that the song seemed " tailor @-@ made " for him , playing on the strengths that led him to win American Idol . Montgomery also said , " his husky , broad voice , <unk> guitar playing and genuinely sweet disposition – and wraps them in a well @-@ worn , subtly sexy tune , full of wide @-@ eyed , dare we say inspirational sentiments . Yet , at the same time , it 's also incredibly earnest in tone . " Misha Berson of the Seattle Times described the song as " surprising , and maybe a little jarring at first , if you expected a ballad or a mellow groove with a spare arrangement , like some of Allen 's best performances on American Idol that paved the way to his Season 8 win " . In spite of Berson 's initial surprise at the song 's sound , she went on to praise the single as " very catchy , a bit inspirational " , and " energetic " . She praised the chorus and further commended the song as " a marked improvement over what some Idol winners have put out as their first post @-@ show single " .

 The music video was directed by Marco Puig and filmed in a desert near Los Angeles , California . The video premiered first on AOL 's PopEater on November 6 , 2009 . Allen told Billboard magazine , " The video looks great . It was really fun shooting it @-@ we shot it from 8 p.m. until 8 a.m. so it was an all @-@ night thing with no breaks .

 The video begins with Allen pulling up to a junkyard in a white pickup truck at night , with a watch hanging from his key chain . Then , Allen takes a power cord out of the back of the truck and carries it through the junkyard until he plugs it in and flips a switch to turn on a large countdown clock . As the clock reaches zero , Allen leaves and begins walking away from the camera as the sun rises . Throughout the video , Allen is shown playing both an acoustic guitar and a piano , as well as singing without any instruments . 
 Michael Slezak of Entertainment Weekly said that the video was " a luxe @-@ looking , moodily lit affair that finds the season 8 champ clad in a physique @-@ appropriate black henley and stalking his way through an abandoned construction site featuring a giant countdown clock , a dramatic sunrise , and copious amounts of recycled plastic sheeting . " Slezak also said that , " the folks at 19 gave Kris the proper budget to kick off his video career – at least we finally know what the company did with the savings gleaned from hiring student filmmakers to helm Blake Lewis and Diana DeGarmo ’ s tragic first clips " . James Montgomery of MTV News noted that the video looked better and more expensive that past @-@ first videos by American Idol alumni under 19 . Montgomery also compared the video 's " artfully color @-@ saturated frames and great expanses " to Snow Patrol 's " Run " clip and the Madonna , Justin Timberlake , and Timbaland 's " 4 Minutes " , doing away with the " narrative crutch most Idol champs ' debuts lean on ( see , for example , David Cook 's ' Light On ' ) , putting the focus squarely on Allen himself . " He also said that , " while Allen 's debut video isn 't as flashy @-@ <unk> as Idol compatriot Adam Lambert 's ' Time for Miracles , ' it 's just as good – mostly because , rather than rely on fiery explosions , ' Dying ' plays it straight , showcasing Allen and his talents " , and called it " bold " as Allen was never shown as the " flashy type " .

 Acrocanthosaurus ( / <unk> / ak @-@ ro @-@ KAN @-@ <unk> @-@ SAWR @-@ əs ; meaning " high @-@ spined lizard " ) is a genus of theropod dinosaur that existed in what is now North America during the Aptian and early Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous . Like most dinosaur genera , Acrocanthosaurus contains only a single species , A. atokensis . Its fossil remains are found mainly in the U.S. states of Oklahoma , Texas , and Wyoming , although teeth attributed to Acrocanthosaurus have been found as far east as Maryland . 
 Acrocanthosaurus was a bipedal predator . As the name suggests , it is best known for the high neural spines on many of its vertebrae , which most likely supported a ridge of muscle over the animal 's neck , back and hips . Acrocanthosaurus was one of the largest theropods , approaching 11 @.@ 5 m ( 38 ft ) in length , and weighing up to 6 @.@ 2 tonnes ( 6 @.@ 8 short tons ) . Large theropod footprints discovered in Texas may have been made by Acrocanthosaurus , although there is no direct association with skeletal remains . 
 Recent discoveries have elucidated many details of its anatomy , allowing for specialized studies focusing on its brain structure and forelimb function . Acrocanthosaurus was the largest theropod in its ecosystem and likely an apex predator which preyed on sauropods , ornithopods , and ankylosaurs . 
 = = Description = = 
 Acrocanthosaurus was among the largest theropods known to exist . The largest known specimen ( NCSM 14345 ) is estimated to have measured 11 @.@ 5 m ( 38 ft ) from snout to tail tip and weighed 5 @.@ 7 t ( 6 @.@ 3 short tons ) to 6 @.@ 2 t ( 6 @.@ 8 short tons ) , with an upper maximum weight of 7 @.@ 25 t ( 7 @.@ 99 short tons ) within the realm of possibility for this specimen . Its skull alone was nearly 1 @.@ 3 m ( 4 @.@ 3 ft ) in length . 
 The skull of Acrocanthosaurus , like most other allosauroids , was long , low and narrow . The weight @-@ reducing opening in front of the eye socket ( antorbital fenestra ) was quite large , more than a quarter of the length of the skull and two @-@ thirds of its height . The outside surface of the maxilla ( upper jaw bone ) and the upper surface of the nasal bone on the roof of the snout were not nearly as rough @-@ textured as those of Giganotosaurus or Carcharodontosaurus . Long , low ridges arose from the nasal bones , running along each side of the snout from the nostril back to the eye , where they continued onto the lacrimal bones . This is a characteristic feature of all allosauroids . Unlike Allosaurus , there was no prominent crest on the lacrimal bone in front of the eye . The lacrimal and postorbital bones met to form a thick brow over the eye , as seen in carcharodontosaurids and the unrelated abelisaurids . Nineteen curved , serrated teeth lined each side of the upper jaw , but a tooth count for the lower jaw has not been published . Acrocanthosaurus teeth were wider than those of Carcharodontosaurus and did not have the wrinkled texture that characterized the carcharodontosaurids . The dentary ( tooth @-@ bearing lower jaw bone ) was squared off at the front edge , as in Giganotosaurus , and shallow , while the rest of the jaw behind it became very deep . Acrocanthosaurus and Giganotosaurus shared a thick horizontal ridge on the outside surface of the surangular bone of the lower jaw , underneath the articulation with the skull . 
 The most notable feature of Acrocanthosaurus was its row of tall neural spines , located on the vertebrae of the neck , back , hips and upper tail , which could be more than 2 @.@ 5 times the height of the vertebrae from which they extended . Other dinosaurs also had high spines on the back , sometimes much higher than those of Acrocanthosaurus . For instance , the unrelated Spinosaurus had spines nearly 2 meters ( 6 @.@ 5 ft ) tall , about 11 times taller than the bodies of its vertebrae . The lower spines of Acrocanthosaurus had attachments for powerful muscles like those of modern bison , probably forming a tall , thick ridge down its back . The function of the spines remains unknown , although they may have been involved in communication , fat storage , or temperature control . All of its cervical ( neck ) and dorsal ( back ) vertebrae had prominent depressions ( pleurocoels ) on the sides , while the caudal ( tail ) vertebrae bore smaller ones . This is more similar to carcharodontosaurids than to Allosaurus . 
 Aside from its vertebrae , Acrocanthosaurus had a typical allosauroid skeleton . Acrocanthosaurus was bipedal , with a long , heavy tail counterbalancing the head and body , maintaining its center of gravity over its hips . Its forelimbs were relatively shorter and more robust than those of Allosaurus but were otherwise similar : each hand bore three clawed digits . Unlike many smaller fast @-@ running dinosaurs , its femur was longer than its tibia and metatarsals , suggesting that Acrocanthosaurus was not a fast runner . Unsurprisingly , the hind leg bones of Acrocanthosaurus were proportionally more robust than its smaller relative Allosaurus . Its feet had four digits each , although as is typical for theropods , the first was much smaller than the rest and did not make contact with the ground . 
 = = Classification and systematics = = 
 Acrocanthosaurus is classified in the superfamily <unk> within the infraorder Tetanurae . This superfamily is characterized by paired ridges on the nasal and lacrimal bones on top of the snout and tall neural spines on the neck vertebrae , among other features . It was originally placed in the family Allosauridae with Allosaurus , an arrangement also supported by studies as late as 2000 . Most studies have found it to be a member of the related family Carcharodontosauridae . 
 At the time of its discovery , Acrocanthosaurus and most other large theropods were known from only fragmentary remains , leading to highly variable classifications for this genus . J. Willis Stovall and Wann Langston Jr. first assigned it to the " <unk> " , the equivalent of Allosauridae , but it was transferred to the taxonomic wastebasket Megalosauridae by Alfred Sherwood Romer in 1956 . To other authors , the long spines on its vertebrae suggested a relationship with Spinosaurus . This interpretation of Acrocanthosaurus as a spinosaurid persisted into the 1980s , and was repeated in the semi @-@ technical dinosaur books of the time . 
 Tall spined vertebrae from the Early Cretaceous of England were once considered to be very similar to those of Acrocanthosaurus , and in 1988 Gregory S. Paul named them as a second species of the genus , A. <unk> . These bones were originally assigned to Altispinax , an English theropod otherwise known only from teeth , and this assignment led to at least one author proposing that Altispinax itself was a synonym of Acrocanthosaurus . These vertebrae were later assigned to the new genus <unk> , separate from both Acrocanthosaurus and Altispinax . 
 Most cladistic analyses including Acrocanthosaurus have found it to be a carcharodontosaurid , usually in a basal position relative to the African Carcharodontosaurus and Giganotosaurus from South America . It has often been considered the sister taxon to the equally basal <unk> , also from Africa . Neovenator , discovered in England , is often considered an even more basal carcharodontosaurid , or as a basal member of a sister group called <unk> . This suggests that the family originated in Europe and then dispersed into the southern continents ( at the time united as the supercontinent Gondwana ) . If Acrocanthosaurus was a carcharodontosaurid , then dispersal would also have occurred into North America . All known carcharodontosaurids lived during the early @-@ to @-@ middle Cretaceous Period . 
 The following cladogram after Novas et al . , 2013 , shows the placement of Acrocanthosaurus within Carcharodontosauridae . 
 = = Discovery and naming = = 
 Acrocanthosaurus is named for its tall neural spines , from the Greek <unk> / <unk> ( ' high ' ) , <unk> / <unk> ( ' thorn ' or ' spine ' ) and <unk> / sauros ( ' lizard ' ) . There is one named species ( A. atokensis ) , which is named after <unk> County in Oklahoma , where the original specimens were found . The name was coined in 1950 by American paleontologists J. Willis Stovall and Wann Langston Jr . Langston had proposed the name " <unk> <unk> " for the genus and species in his unpublished 1947 master 's thesis , but the name was changed to Acrocanthosaurus atokensis for formal publication . 
 The holotype and paratype ( OMNH 10146 and OMNH <unk> ) , discovered in the early 1940s and described at the same time in 1950 , consist of two partial skeletons and a piece of skull material from the Antlers Formation in Oklahoma . Two much more complete specimens were described in the 1990s . The first ( SMU <unk> ) is a partial skeleton , missing most of the skull , recovered from the Twin Mountains Formation of Texas and currently part of the Fort Worth Museum of Science and History collection . An even more complete skeleton ( NCSM 14345 , nicknamed " Fran " ) was recovered from the Antlers Formation of Oklahoma by <unk> Hall and Sid Love , prepared by the Black Hills Institute in South Dakota , and is now housed at the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences in Raleigh . This specimen is the largest and includes the only known complete skull and forelimb . Skeletal elements of OMNH <unk> are almost the same size as comparable bones in NCSM 14345 , indicating an animal of roughly the same size , while the holotype and SMU <unk> are significantly smaller . 
 The presence of Acrocanthosaurus in the Cloverly Formation was established in 2012 with the description of another partial skeleton , UM <unk> . This specimen , consisting of parts of two vertebrae , partial pubic bones , a femur , a partial fibula , and fragments , represents a juvenile animal . It came from a bonebed in the Bighorn Basin of north @-@ central Wyoming , and was found near the shoulder blade of a Sauroposeidon . An assortment of other fragmentary theropod remains from the formation may also belong to Acrocanthosaurus , which may be the only large theropod in the Cloverly Formation . 
 Acrocanthosaurus may be known from less complete remains outside of Oklahoma , Texas , and Wyoming . A tooth from southern Arizona has been referred to the genus , and matching tooth marks have been found in sauropod bones from the same area . Several teeth from the Arundel Formation of Maryland have been described as almost identical to those of Acrocanthosaurus and may represent an eastern representative of the genus . Many other teeth and bones from various geologic formations throughout the western United States have also been referred to Acrocanthosaurus , but most of these have been misidentified ; there is , however , some disagreement with this assessment regarding fossils from the Cloverly Formation . 
 = = Paleobiology = = 
 = = = Growth and longevity = = = 
 From the bone features of the holotype OMNH 10146 and NCSM 14345 , it is estimated that Acrocanthosaurus requires at least 12 years to fully grow . This number may be much higher because in the process of bones remodeling and the growth of the medullary cavity , some Harris lines were lost . If accounting for these lines , Acrocanthosaurus needs 18 – 24 years to be mature . 
 = = = <unk> function = = = 
 Like those of most other non @-@ avian theropods , Acrocanthosaurus forelimbs did not make contact with the ground and were not used for locomotion ; instead they served a predatory function . The discovery of a complete forelimb ( NCSM 14345 ) allowed the first analysis of the function and range of motion of the forelimb in Acrocanthosaurus . The study examined the bone surfaces which would have articulated with other bones to determine how far the joints could move without dislocating . In many of the joints , the bones did not fit together exactly , indicating the presence of a considerable amount of cartilage in the joints , as is seen in many living archosaurs . Among other findings , the study suggested that , in a resting position , the forelimbs would have hung from the shoulders with the humerus angled backwards slightly , the elbow bent , and the claws facing medially ( inwards ) . The shoulder of Acrocanthosaurus was limited in its range of motion compared to that of humans . The arm could not swing in a complete circle , but could retract ( swing backwards ) 109 ° from the vertical , so that the humerus could actually be angled slightly upwards . <unk> ( swinging forward ) was limited to only 24 ° past the vertical . The arm was unable to reach a vertical position when <unk> ( swinging downwards ) , but could abduct ( swing upwards ) to 9 ° above horizontal . Movement at the elbow was also limited compared to humans , with a total range of motion of only 57 ° . The arm could not completely extend ( straighten ) , nor could it flex ( bend ) very far , with the humerus unable even to form a right angle with the forearm . The radius and ulna ( forearm bones ) locked together so that there was no possibility of pronation or <unk> ( twisting ) as in human forearms . 
 None of the carpals ( wrist bones ) fit together precisely , suggesting the presence of a large amount of cartilage in the wrist , which would have stiffened it . All of the digits were able to <unk> ( bend backwards ) until they nearly touched the wrist . When flexed , the middle digit would converge towards the first digit , while the third digit would twist inwards . The first digit of the hand bore the largest claw , which was permanently flexed so that it curved back towards the underside of the hand . Likewise , the middle claw may have been permanently flexed , while the third claw , also the smallest , was able to both flex and extend . 
 After determining the ranges of motion in the joints of the forelimb , the study went on to hypothesize about the predatory habits of Acrocanthosaurus . The forelimbs could not swing forward very far , unable even to scratch the animal 's own neck . Therefore , they were not likely to have been used in the initial capture of prey and Acrocanthosaurus probably led with its mouth when hunting . On the other hand , the forelimbs were able to retract towards the body very strongly . Once prey had been seized in the jaws , the heavily muscled forelimbs may have retracted , holding the prey tightly against the body and preventing escape . As the prey animal attempted to pull away , it would only have been further impaled on the permanently flexed claws of the first two digits . The extreme <unk> of the digits may have been an adaptation allowing Acrocanthosaurus to hold struggling prey without fear of dislocation . Once the prey was trapped against the body , Acrocanthosaurus may have dispatched it with its jaws . Another possibility is that Acrocanthosaurus held its prey in its jaws , while repeatedly retracting its forelimbs , tearing large gashes with its claws . 
 = = = Brain and inner ear structure = = = 
 In 2005 , scientists reconstructed an endocast ( replica ) of an Acrocanthosaurus cranial cavity using computed tomography ( CT scanning ) to analyze the spaces within the holotype braincase ( OMNH 10146 ) . In life , much of this space would have been filled with the meninges and cerebrospinal fluid , in addition to the brain itself . However , the general features of the brain and cranial nerves could be determined from the endocast and compared to other theropods for which endocasts have been created . While the brain is similar to many theropods , it is most similar to that of allosauroids . It most resembles the brains of Carcharodontosaurus and Giganotosaurus rather than those of Allosaurus or Sinraptor , providing support for the hypothesis that Acrocanthosaurus was a carcharodontosaurid . 
 The brain was slightly <unk> ( S @-@ shaped ) , without much expansion of the cerebral hemispheres , more like a crocodile than a bird . This is in keeping with the overall conservatism of non @-@ coelurosaurian theropod brains . Acrocanthosaurus had large and bulbous olfactory bulbs , indicating a good sense of smell . Reconstructing the semicircular canals of the ear , which control balance , shows that the head was held at a 25 ° angle below horizontal . This was determined by orienting the endocast so that the lateral semicircular canal was parallel to the ground , as it usually is when an animal is in an alert posture . 
 = = = Possible footprints = = = 
 The Glen Rose Formation of central Texas preserves many dinosaur footprints , including large , three @-@ toed theropod prints . The most famous of these trackways was discovered along the <unk> River in Dinosaur Valley State Park , a section of which is now on exhibit in the American Museum of Natural History in New York City , although several other sites around the state have been described in the literature . It is impossible to say what animal made the prints , since no fossil bones have been associated with the trackways . However , scientists have long considered it likely that the footprints belong to Acrocanthosaurus . A 2001 study compared the Glen Rose footprints to the feet of various large theropods but could not confidently assign them to any particular genus . However , the study noted that the tracks were within the ranges of size and shape expected for Acrocanthosaurus . Because the Glen Rose Formation is close to the Antlers and Twin Mountains Formations in both geographical location and geological age , and the only large theropod known from those formations is Acrocanthosaurus , the study concluded that Acrocanthosaurus was most likely to have made the tracks . 
 The famous Glen Rose trackway on display in New York City includes theropod footprints belonging to several individuals which moved in the same direction as up to twelve sauropod dinosaurs . The theropod prints are sometimes found on top of the sauropod footprints , indicating that they were formed later . This has been put forth as evidence that a small pack of Acrocanthosaurus was stalking a herd of sauropods . While interesting and plausible , this hypothesis is difficult to prove and other explanations exist . For example , several solitary theropods may have moved through in the same direction at different times after the sauropods had passed , creating the appearance of a pack stalking its prey . The same can be said for the purported " herd " of sauropods , who also may or may not have been moving as a group . At a point where it crosses the path of one of the sauropods , one of the theropod trackways is missing a footprint , which has been cited as evidence of an attack . However , other scientists doubt the validity of this interpretation because the sauropod did not change gait , as would be expected if a large predator were hanging onto its side .

 Definite Acrocanthosaurus fossils have been found in the Twin Mountains Formation of northern Texas , the Antlers Formation of southern Oklahoma , and the Cloverly Formation of north @-@ central Wyoming and possibly even the Arundel Formation in Maryland and in Florida . These geological formations have not been dated radiometrically , but scientists have used biostratigraphy to estimate their age . Based on changes in ammonite taxa , the boundary between the Aptian and Albian stages of the Early Cretaceous has been located within the Glen Rose Formation of Texas , which may contain Acrocanthosaurus footprints and lies just above the Twin Mountains Formation . This indicates that the Twin Mountains Formation lies entirely within the Aptian stage , which lasted from 125 to 112 million years ago . The Antlers Formation contains fossils of Deinonychus and Tenontosaurus , two dinosaur genera also found in the Cloverly Formation , which has been radiometrically dated to the Aptian and Albian stages , suggesting a similar age for the Antlers . Therefore , Acrocanthosaurus most likely existed between 125 and 100 million years ago . 
 During this time , the area preserved in the Twin Mountains and Antlers formations was a large floodplain that drained into a shallow inland sea . A few million years later , this sea would expand to the north , becoming the Western Interior Seaway and dividing North America in two for nearly the entire Late Cretaceous . The Glen Rose Formation represents a coastal environment , with possible Acrocanthosaurus tracks preserved in mudflats along the ancient shoreline . As Acrocanthosaurus was a large predator , it is expected that it had an extensive home range and lived in many different environments in the area . Potential prey animals include sauropods like Astrodon or possibly even the enormous Sauroposeidon , as well as large ornithopods like Tenontosaurus . The smaller theropod Deinonychus also prowled the area but at 3 m ( 10 ft ) in length , most likely provided only minimal competition for Acrocanthosaurus . 
 = Delaware @-@ class battleship = 
 The Delaware @-@ class battleships of the United States Navy were the second class of American dreadnoughts . With this class , the 16 @,@ 000 long tons ( 16 @,@ 257 t ) limit imposed on capital ships by the United States Congress was waived , which allowed designers at the Navy 's Bureau of Construction and Repair to correct what they considered flaws in the preceding South Carolina class and produce ships not only more powerful but also more effective and rounded overall . Launched in 1909 , these ships became the first in US naval history to exceed 20 @,@ 000 long tons ( 20 @,@ 321 t ) . 
 The Delawares carried a battery of ten 12 @-@ inch ( 305 mm ) guns in five turrets , an increase of two guns over the South Carolinas . With these ships , the US Navy re @-@ adopted a full @-@ fledged medium @-@ caliber weapon for anti @-@ torpedo boat defense . While the 5 @-@ inch ( 127 mm ) gun was smaller than that used by other major navies , this would , with few exceptions , become the standard medium @-@ gun caliber for the US Navy for the better part of the 20th century . As for speed , the Delawares were capable of 21 kn ( 24 mph ; 39 km / h ) , a significant improvement over the earlier class 's 18 @.@ 5 kn ( 21 mph ; 34 km / h ) . This would become the speed for all American standard @-@ type battleships . Propulsion systems were mixed ; while North Dakota was fitted with steam turbines , Delaware retained triple @-@ expansion engines . US turbines at this point did not give great advantages in output or speed over triple @-@ expansion systems , as the engineering difficulties faced by turbine manufacturers there were still extremely great , and were much less fuel @-@ efficient , a significant concern for a Navy with Pacific responsibilities but lacking Britain 's extensive network of coaling stations . 
 These ships saw varied service during their careers . As part of Battleship Division Nine of the US Atlantic Fleet , Delaware was assigned to the British Grand Fleet after America 's entry into World War I , where she escorted convoys and participated in the blockade of the German High Seas Fleet . In contrast , North Dakota remained on the American coast throughout the war , due in part to worries about her troublesome turbine engines . Post @-@ war , they conducted training cruises with the US Atlantic Fleet . In 1924 , Delaware was broken up for scrap metal in accordance with the Washington Naval Treaty of 1922 . North Dakota survived until 1931 , when she too was scrapped , under the terms of the 1930 London Naval Treaty . 
 = = Design = = 
 Prompted by the launch of and misinformation about HMS Dreadnought , the US Navy and Congress faced what they perceived as a vastly better battleship than the two South Carolina battleships then under construction , which were designed under tonnage constraints that Congress had imposed on capital ships . Actually , the South Carolinas were inferior only in speed to Dreadnought ; they carried fewer heavy guns but , unlike Dreadnought , could bring all of them to bear on the broadside . Because of this , they could fire an equal weight of metal . Also , because greater time and care had been taken with their armor and bulkhead arrangement , they were better protected than the British ship . None of this was realized at the time . Nevertheless , the Navy 's Bureau of Construction and Repair ( C & R ) had struggled tremendously to design an adequate warship under congressional limits and had taken battleship design as far under those restrictions as it could . Seeing now that those limits had become unrealistic , Congress ended them ; any subsequent constraints would be dictated by treaty limitations . The language of the authorizing act of June 26 , 1906 was for a battleship " carrying as heavy armor and as a powerful armament as any known vessel of its class , to have the highest practicable speed and the greatest practicable radius of action . " 
 The Delaware class was the second of 11 distinct US capital ship designs begun from 1906 to 1919 ; some 29 battleships and six battlecruisers were laid down during this period , though seven of the battleships and all six of the battlecruisers were cancelled . Except for the Lexington @-@ class battlecruisers , these were all relatively slow ships , designed for no more than 23 kn ( 26 mph ; 43 km / h ) . They ranged in displacement from 16 @,@ 000 to 42 @,@ 000 long tons ( 16 @,@ 257 to 42 @,@ 674 t ) . At this time , no US dreadnought class battleship had yet hit the water as all were either at some stage of building or in design . Virtually the entire US Navy battle line was being designed by drawing on experience from pre @-@ dreadnought designs , or from observation of foreign battleship design . 
 The design for these ships was actually ready in 1905 or 1906 . Two variants were offered — a 10 @-@ gun version on 20 @,@ 500 long tons ( 20 @,@ 829 t ) and a 12 @-@ gun alternative on 24 @,@ 000 long tons ( 24 @,@ 385 t ) . The larger ship was rejected as too expensive for the firepower it offered , even after its displacement was reduced to 22 @,@ 000 long tons ( 22 @,@ 353 t ) tons . Also , because C & R was required to consider private designs , construction on the Delawares did not commence until 1907 . None of the private designs was considered remotely satisfactory by the Navy . However , Fore River later developed its version into the battleship Rivadavia , which was built for the Argentine navy . While the C & R design was considered superior , it still came under criticism , particularly for the poor placement of and lack of protection for the secondary armament . 
 = = = General characteristics = = = 
 The Delawares were significantly more powerful than their predecessors , the South Carolina @-@ class , and are mentioned by Conway 's All the World 's Fighting Ships as the first to match the standard set by the British with Dreadnought . This was due in large part to the elimination of Congressional limits on the size of new battleships ; the only restriction the Congress placed on their design was that the cost of hull and machinery could not exceed 6 million USD . The Delaware @-@ class ships were also significantly larger than the South Carolinas . They were 510 ft ( 155 m ) long at the waterline and 518 ft 9 in ( 158 m ) long overall . By comparison , the South Carolina @-@ class ships were 452 ft 9 in ( 138 m ) long overall . The Delawares had a beam of 85 ft 3 in ( 26 m ) and a draft of 27 ft 3 in ( 8 m ) ; the South Carolinas measurements were 80 ft 3 in ( 24 m ) and 24 ft 6 in ( 7 m ) , respectively . The Delaware @-@ class ships displaced 20 @,@ 380 long tons ( 20 @,@ 707 t ) at standard displacement and 22 @,@ 060 long tons ( 22 @,@ 414 t ) at full load , while the South Carolinas displaced 16 @,@ 000 long tons ( 16 @,@ 257 t ) at standard displacement and 17 @,@ 617 long tons ( 17 @,@ 900 t ) at full load . Their bows had an early example of bulbous forefeet . 
 = = = Propulsion = = = 
 For reasons including expected hostilities with Japan , requiring travel across the Pacific Ocean , long operational range was a recurrent theme in all US battleship designs . As an experiment , these ships received different powerplants . Delaware received triple @-@ expansion reciprocating engines , while North Dakota was fitted with Curtiss direct drive steam turbine engines . Both ships had 14 Babcock & Wilcox boilers , both original power plants were rated at 25 @,@ 000 shp ( 18 @,@ 642 kW ) ; and both ships were capable of reaching 21 knots . Chief Constructor Washington L. Capps predicted North Dakota would have a 25 percent shorter radius than Delaware at 16 knots and 45 percent less at 14 knots , based on tank tests and the known performance of steam turbines at that time . This estimate was proved true during the ships ' trial runs in 1909 . Also , because Delaware 's engine bearings were equipped with forced lubrication instead of a gravity @-@ fed system , she was able to steam at full speed for 24 hours without any need for engine repair . This would normally have been unthinkable as reciprocating engines were known generally to shake themselves apart if run at full power for long . However , this penchant for reliability came under question in the late 1930s as battleships with reciprocating engines performed poorly in the Pacific . By 1915 , more powerful and efficient geared turbines had been installed in North Dakota to replace her Curtiss turbines . These provided 31 @,@ 300 shp ( 23 @,@ 340 kW ) horsepower , some 6 @,@ 000 shp ( 4 @,@ 474 kW ) greater than her original engines . 
 = = = Armament = = = 
 = = = = Main guns = = = = 
 The Delaware @-@ class ships were armed with ten 12 @-@ inch / 45 caliber Mark 5 guns in five twin gun turrets ; this was an addition of two guns compared to the preceding South Carolinas . The gun housings were the Mark 7 type , and they allowed for depression to − 5 degrees and elevation to 15 degrees . The guns had a rate of fire of 2 to 3 rounds per minute . They fired 870 lb ( 395 kg ) shells , of either armor @-@ piercing ( AP ) or Common types , though the Common type was obsolete by 1915 and put out of production . The propellant charge was 310 lb ( 141 kg ) in silk bags , and provided a muzzle velocity of 2 @,@ 700 ft / s ( 823 m / s ) . The guns were expected to fire 175 rounds before the barrels would require replacement . The two ships carried 100 shells per gun , or 1 @,@ 000 rounds in total . At 15 degrees elevation , the guns could hit targets out to approximately 20 @,@ 000 yd ( 18 @,@ 288 m ) . 
 Two turrets were mounted fore in a superfiring pair , while the other three were mounted aft of the main superstructure , all on the centerline . The placement of the rear gun turrets proved problematic . Capps placed the rear superfiring turret , Number 3 , closest amidships . Since it represented the greatest weight borne by the ship 's structure due to its tall barbette , this placement would allow it support by the greatest amount of underwater volume available . The other two rear turrets , Numbers 4 and 5 , were placed level and back to back . This arrangement was detrimental in two ways . First , Number 3 could not fire astern with Number 4 trained forward , which left only the two 12 " guns of Number 5 to do so . Second , because the engine room was situated between Numbers 3 and 4 , steam lines ran from the boiler rooms amidships around the ammunition magazine for Number 3 turret to the engine room . These lines , it was later found , had the potential to heat the powder in the magazine and degrade its ballistics . This design flaw was also prevalent in several British dreadnoughts but was considered inescapable by naval designers on structural grounds . 
 Another challenge with the main armament was that its weight , 437 long tons ( 444 t ) per turret , which had to be spread over much of the hull , led to increased stress on the structure . The closer the weight of the heavy guns to the ends , the greater the stress and risk for structural failure due to metal fatigue . High speed required fine ends , which were not especially buoyant , and the amount of space needed amidships for machinery precluded moving the main turrets further inboard . Not having to worry about a displacement limit allowed Capps the option of deepening the hull , which helped to some extent . He added a forecastle to allow for better seakeeping and to make room for officers ' quarters and restored the full height of the hull aft . The problem itself , however remained . 
 = = = = Secondary guns = = = = 
 The Naval War College in its 1905 Newport Summer Conference considered the 3 @-@ inch ( 76 mm ) guns fitted to the South Carolina class too light for effective anti @-@ torpedo @-@ boat defense . A committee on this issue formed during the conference suggested that a gun with a high velocity and flat trajectory would work best — one powerful enough to smash an attacking vessel yet light enough for easy handling and rapid firing . For this purpose , the committee found 5 @-@ inch guns appeared best suited . During the Delawares ' design , C & R considered 6 @-@ inch ( 152 mm ) guns but concerns voiced by the Naval War College about the lack of heavy splinter protection for these guns and smoke uptakes led to an adaption of 5 @-@ inch / <unk> guns to balance the increase in armor weight . 
 The Delawares mounted fourteen 5 @-@ inch / 50 caliber Mark 6 guns , two forward on the main deck , 10 inch casemates on the side and two aft on the main deck abeam No. 5 turret . They had a rate of fire of 6 to 8 rounds per minute . They fired three types of rounds : a " light " AP shell that weighed 50 lb ( 23 kg ) and a " heavy " AP round that weighed 60 lb ( 27 kg ) . The third type was the Common Mark 15 shell , which also weighed 50 lb . The 50 lb shells were fired at a muzzle velocity of 3 @,@ 000 ft / s ( 914 m / s ) , while the larger 60 lb shells traveled at a slightly slower 2 @,@ 700 ft / s ( 823 m / s ) . The guns were emplaced on both Mark 9 and Mark 12 pedestal mounts ; the Mark 9 version limited elevation to 15 degrees , while the Mark 12 allowed for up to 25 degrees . The 5 @-@ inch / 50 was able to penetrate most effectively at 5 @,@ 000 yd ( 4 @,@ 572 m ) , which was the deciding factor in the decision to equip the Delaware class with them . The 5 @-@ inch guns were supplied with a total of 240 rounds per barrel . 
 While these guns were considered an improvement by the Navy over that of the South Carolinas , their placement remained problematic as even in calm water , they were extremely wet and thus difficult to man . The forward guns were moved into the superstructure after sea trials . The casemate @-@ mounted secondary armament was one deck below the main deck and provided the majority of the complaints from shipping water from the forward positions and breaking the flow of the bow wave imparting extra drag on the design .

 As with the South Carolina class , these ships were fitted with two 3 @-@ inch / 50 caliber anti @-@ aircraft ( AA ) guns in Mark 11 mounts in 1917 .

They had a trunnion height of 66 @.@ 25 in ( 168 cm ) compared to a height of 45 in ( 114 cm ) for the pedestal mountings used against surface craft . This allowed them an elevation range between − 10 and 85 degrees . Maximum range was 14 @,@ 600 yd ( 13 @,@ 350 m ) at 43 degrees and maximum ceiling 30 @,@ 400 ft ( 9 @,@ 266 m ) at 85 degrees .

 The armored belt ranged in thickness from 9 to 11 in ( 229 to 279 mm ) in the more important areas of the ship . <unk> guns mounted in the hull had between 8 and 10 in ( 203 and 254 mm ) of armor plate . The barbettes that housed the main gun turrets were armored with between 4 and 10 in ( 102 and 254 mm ) of armor ; the side portions more vulnerable to shell fire were thicker , while the front and rear sections of the barbette , which were less likely to be hit , received thinner armor to save weight . The gun turrets themselves were armored with 12 in ( 305 mm ) of armor . The conning tower was 11 @.@ 5 in ( 292 mm ) thick . As in the designs of all early dreadnoughts , the deck armor was very thin at 1 @.@ 5 in ( 38 mm ) in most areas and 2 in ( 51 mm ) over machinery and magazine spaces . These ships were expected to do most of their firing at ranges less than 10 @,@ 000 yd ( 9 @,@ 144 m ) . At such distances , deck strikes would be a rare event .

 During trials , Delaware was run at full speed for 24 hours straight to prove that her machinery could handle the stress . She was the first American battleship to achieve the feat . Late in 1910 , Delaware sailed to Europe , followed by a trip to South America early in 1911 . She made a further two voyages to Europe in 1912 and 1913 , before returning to the US Atlantic Fleet for training exercises that were conducted in the western Atlantic and Caribbean . Delaware took part in the Second battle of Vera Cruz in April – May 1914 . 
 When the United States declared war on Germany in April 1917 , Delaware was initially tasked with readiness training off the East Coast . Late in the year , she was deployed to Europe as part of the US Navy 's Battleship Division Nine , under the command of Rear Admiral Hugh Rodman . The force arrived on 7 December and was assigned to the 6th Battle Squadron of the Grand Fleet . In July 1918 , Delaware was withdrawn from overseas service and returned to the United States . 
 In 1920 , the US Navy adopted hull numbers for its ships ; Delaware was assigned the hull number BB @-@ 28 . Delaware made only two more cruises , both for midshipmen , under her new identification number : one in 1922 and the second in early 1923 . Delaware sailed to Europe on the second trip , and stopped at a number of ports , including Gibraltar . She returned to the US in August of that year , at which point her crew was reassigned to the newer battleship Colorado . She was then taken to the Boston Navy Yard , where her armaments were removed . The ship was decommissioned in November 1923 and sold to shipbreakers in February 1924 . 
 = = = USS North Dakota = = = 
 Upon commissioning , the ship was assigned to the Atlantic Fleet , alongside her sister Delaware . Her first overseas cruise came in November 1910 , when she steamed across the Atlantic to visit France and Britain . North Dakota also took part in the invasion of Vera Cruz in 1914 . Unlike her sister , North Dakota remained off the American coast for the duration of the United States ' involvement in World War I. Hugh Rodman , the commander of the American expeditionary force , specifically requested that North Dakota be kept stateside ; he felt her turbine engines were too unreliable for the ship to be deployed to a war zone . 
 From 1917 , she was employed as a training ship for gunners and engineers . Post @-@ war , North Dakota made a second trip to Europe , primarily to ports in the Mediterranean Sea . During the visit , the ship was tasked with the return of the remains of the Italian ambassador , Vincenzo Macchi di <unk> , who had died 20 October 1919 in Washington , DC . The ship participated in the aerial bombing demonstrations off the Virginia Capes in 1921 . In 1923 , a third trip to Europe , this time with midshipmen from the Naval Academy aboard . The ship stopped in Spain , Scotland , and Scandinavia . 
 Like her sister , she was relegated to the surplus naval forces that had to be dismantled under the Washington Naval Treaty . In November 1923 , North Dakota was decommissioned ; she had her armaments removed in 1924 , after which she was converted into a target ship . She was redesignated as " unclassified " , and served as a target until 1931 , when she was scrapped .

 The 1889 – 90 Currie Cup was the inaugural edition of the Currie Cup , the premier first @-@ class cricket tournament in South Africa . The 1889 – 90 competition involved just two teams , Transvaal and Kimberley . The two sides played a single , three @-@ day match , which was won by Transvaal by six wickets . 
 Both sides made low scores in their first innings ; Kimberley , who had opted to bat first , were dismissed for 98 runs , and in their reply Transvaal reached 117 , a lead of just 19 runs . In the second innings , they both fared better ; a century from Bernard Tancred helped Kimberley to a total of 235 , but Transvaal reached their total in 38 five @-@ ball overs , helped by a century from Monty Bowden . 
 = = Background = = 
 First @-@ class cricket was first played in South Africa in the previous 1888 – 89 season , when Robert Warton managed a side which toured the country , playing against representative teams from each of the provinces , and two matches against South Africa , which were later adjudged to have Test cricket status . During that tour , Donald Currie donated the Currie Cup to be awarded to the team which performed best against the touring side ; which was judged to be Kimberley . In other first @-@ class matches during the 1889 – 90 season , Kimberley faced Natal twice , winning both matches . Transvaal did not play any first @-@ class cricket prior to their Currie Cup contest with Kimberley . 
 Transvaal challenged Kimberley for the Currie Cup in 1890 , the first such challenge for the trophy . A number of the team selections were controversial : the selection committee for Transvaal chose Aubrey Smith and Monty Bowden , both of whom had remained in South Africa after touring as part of the England cricket team the previous year , and Charlie Finlason , who played the majority of his cricket for the opposition Kimberley team . Finlason , a newspaper journalist , had fallen out with Smith after writing a number of articles criticising him and the English side . When Finlason was selected for Transvaal , Smith — who was captaining the side — made him bat at number eleven .

 The match began on Saturday 5 April 1890 at the <unk> Cricket Club Ground in Kimberley . The toss was won by the Kimberley captain , Walter Woodthorpe , who opted to bat first . Bernard Tancred and Robert Snedden opened the batting , and scored 25 runs together before the first wicket fell . The Transvaal bowlers took three more wickets for the addition of just 27 runs , leaving Kimberley on 52 for 4 . The batsmen then shared a partnership of 40 runs , but upon the loss of the next wicket , Kimberley suffered a collapse , and were eventually bowled out for 98 runs . Tancred top @-@ scored for the side , accruing 42 runs , but only two other batsmen reached double figures ; Snedden and John Coghlan , both of whom scored 13 . Transvaal only used three bowlers during the innings ; Aubrey Smith and Bentley <unk> each took four wickets , while Charles Vintcent took the remaining two . 
 Transvaal began their reply strongly ; their openers , Monty Bowden and John Hickson put on 69 runs for the first wicket , the majority being scored by Bowden . Once they lost their first wicket , the team continued to lose wickets at regular intervals ; the second @-@ highest partnership of the innings was the 17 runs made for the tenth , or last , wicket . George Glover was the best of the bowlers , collecting six wickets . Glover and Albert Rose @-@ Innes bowled the majority of the overs , and took nine of the wickets between them . Bowden 's score of 63 was substantially the best by any batsman in the innings , only John Piton , Spranger Harrison and Hickson scored more than 10 runs , and none managed as many as 20 . 
 The third innings of the match gave Kimberley a second attempt at batting on the first day ; they lost wickets regularly through the afternoon , but opener Tancred remained at the crease throughout , finishing the day unbeaten on 55 , with the team on 100 for six . The match resumed on Monday 7 April 1890 , with no play scheduled for the Sunday . After the early loss of Rose @-@ Innes for 20 runs , Charles <unk> joined Tancred . The pair scored 97 runs together , taking the score up to 226 . Three quick wickets then ended the Kimberley innings ; they scored 235 runs from 83 overs , in which Tancred scored a century , hitting 106 runs before being leg before wicket to Bowden . Vintcent took the most wickets for Transvaal , claiming four for 70 . Smith claimed two wickets , and Bowden , who was designed on the scorecard as the team 's wicket @-@ keeper also claimed two wickets from the three overs that he bowled . 
 Transvaal batted rapidly in their second innings , reaching the required total to win the match inside the second day of the match , which had been scheduled for three days in total . Opening batsman Bowden batted throughout the whole innings , remaining not out on 126 when his side won the match . He was joined at the end by Vintcent , who scored 60 runs in a partnership of 126 runs between the two players . Kimberley tried six different bowlers in an effort to bowl Transvaal out , but only Rose @-@ Innes and Irvine <unk> took wickets , claiming two apiece .

 = Antlion = 
 The antlions are a group of about 2 @,@ 000 species of insect in the family Myrmeleontidae , known for the fiercely predatory habits of their larvae , which in many species dig pits to trap passing ants or other prey . The adult insects are less well known , as they mostly fly at dusk or after dark , and may be mistakenly identified as dragonflies or damselflies ; they are sometimes known as antlion lacewings , and in North America , the larvae are sometimes referred to as <unk> because of the strange marks they leave in the sand . 
 Antlions are worldwide in distribution . The greatest diversity occurs in the tropics , but a few species are found in cold @-@ temperate locations , one such being the European Euroleon <unk> . They most commonly occur in dry and sandy habitats where the larvae can easily excavate their pits , but some larvae hide under debris or ambush their prey among leaf litter . 
 Antlions are poorly represented in the fossil record . Myrmeleontiformia is generally accepted to be a monophyletic group , and within the Myrmeleontoidea , the antlions ' closest living relatives are thought to be the <unk> ( <unk> ) . The predatory actions of the larvae have attracted attention throughout history , and antlions have been mentioned in literature since classical times .

It has been thought to refer to ants forming a large percentage of the prey of the insect , the suffix " lion " merely suggesting destroyer or hunter . In any case , the term seems to go back to classical antiquity . The antlion larva is often called a " <unk> " in North America because of the odd winding , spiralling trails it leaves in the sand while relocating , which look as if someone has been doodling . 
 The scientific name of the type genus <unk> – and thus , the family as a whole – is derived from Ancient Greek <unk> ( <unk> ) " lion " + <unk> ( μύρμηξ ) " ant " , in a loan translation of the names common across Europe . In most European and Middle Eastern languages , at least the larvae are known under the local term corresponding to " antlion " . 
 = = Description = = 
 Antlions can be fairly small to very large neuropterans , with wingspans ranging from 2 to 15 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 to 5 @.@ 9 in ) . The African genus <unk> contains some of the largest examples . <unk> <unk> is the largest European species , with an 11 cm ( 4 @.@ 3 in ) wingspan , and most North American species approach this size . 
 The adult has two pairs of long , narrow , <unk> , translucent wings and a long , slender abdomen . Although they somewhat resemble dragonflies or damselflies , they belong to a different infraclass of winged insects . Antlion adults are easily distinguished from damselflies by their prominent , <unk> clubbed antennae which are about as long as the head and thorax combined . Also , the pattern of wing venation differs , and compared to damselflies , the adults are very feeble fliers and are normally found fluttering about at night in search of a mate . Adult antlions are typically nocturnal , and rarely seen by day . 
 Males of most species have a unique structure , a bristle @-@ bearing knob known as a " <unk> axillaris " , at the base of the rear wing . The abdomen in males is usually longer than in females and often has an extra lobe . The tip of the abdomen of females shows greater variation than that of males , depending perhaps on oviposition sites , and usually bears tufts of bristles for digging and a finger @-@ like extension . 
 The antlion larva is a ferocious @-@ looking animal with a robust , fusiform body , a very plump abdomen , and a thorax bearing three pairs of walking legs . The prothorax forms a slender mobile " neck " for the large , square , flattened head , which bears an enormous pair of sickle @-@ like jaws with several sharp , hollow projections . The jaws are formed by the maxillae and mandibles ; the mandibles each contain a deep groove over which the maxilla fits neatly , forming an enclosed canal for injecting venom to immobilise the victim , and enzymes to digest its soft parts . The larva is clad in forward @-@ pointing bristles which help it to anchor itself and exert greater traction , enabling it to subdue prey considerably larger than itself . Antlion larvae are unusual among insects in lacking an anus . All the metabolic waste generated during the larval stage is stored , some is used to spin the silk for the cocoon and the rest is eventually voided as meconium at the end of its pupal stage . 
 = = Distribution = = 
 There are about 2 @,@ 000 species of antlion found in most parts of the world , with the greatest diversity being in warmer areas . The best known species are those in which the larvae dig pits to trap their prey , but by no means all species do this . Antlions live in a range of usually dry habitats including open woodland floors , scrub @-@ clad dunes , hedge bases , river banks , road verges , under raised buildings and in vacant lots . 
 = = Life @-@ cycle = = 
 Apart from pit @-@ trap @-@ forming taxa , the biology of members of the family Myrmeleontidae , to which the antlions belong , has been little studied . The life @-@ cycle begins with oviposition ( egg @-@ laying ) in a suitable location . The female antlion repeatedly taps the prospective laying site with the tip of her abdomen and then inserts her ovipositor into the substrate and lays an egg . 
 Depending on the species and where it lives , the larva either conceals itself under leaves , debris or pieces of wood , hides in a crack or digs a funnel @-@ shaped pit in loose material . As ambush predators , catching prey is a risky business because food arrives unpredictably and , for the species that make one , maintaining the trap is costly ; the larvae therefore have low metabolic rates and can survive for long periods without food . They can take several years to complete their life @-@ cycle ; they mature faster with plentiful food , but can survive for many months without feeding . In cooler climates they dig their way deeper and remain inactive during the winter . 
 When the larva attains its maximum size , it pupates and undergoes metamorphosis . It makes a globular cocoon of sand stuck together with fine silk spun from a slender spinneret at the rear end of the body . The cocoon may be buried several centimetres deep in the sand . After the completion of its transformation into an adult insect in about one month , it emerges from the case , leaving the pupal integument behind , and works its way to the surface . After about twenty minutes , the adult 's wings are fully opened and it flies off in search of a mate . The adult is considerably larger than the larva and antlions exhibit the greatest disparity in size between larva and adult of any type of holometabolous insect ; this is by virtue of the fact that the exoskeleton of the adult is extremely thin and flimsy , with an exceptionally low mass per unit of volume . The adult typically lives for about 25 days , but some insects survive for as long as 45 days . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 Antlion larvae eat small arthropods – mainly ants – while the adults of some species eat pollen and nectar , and others are predators of small arthropods . In certain species of Myrmeleontidae , such as Dendroleon <unk> , the larva , although resembling that of <unk> structurally , makes no pitfall trap , but hides in detritus in a hole in a tree and seizes passing prey . In Japan , Dendroleon <unk> larvae lurk on the surface of rocks for several years while awaiting prey ; during this time they often become coated with lichen , and have been recorded at densities of up to 344 per square metre . 
 The larva is a voracious predator . Within a few minutes of seizing its prey with its jaws and injecting it with venom and enzymes , it begins to suck out the digestion products . The larva is extremely sensitive to ground vibrations , the low @-@ frequency sounds made by an insect crawling across the ground ; the larva locates the source of the vibrations by the differences in timing of the arrival of waves detected by receptors , tufts of hairs on the sides of the two hindmost thoracic segments . 
 In trap @-@ building species , an average @-@ sized larva digs a pit about 2 in ( 5 cm ) deep and 3 in ( 7 @.@ 5 cm ) wide at the edge . This behavior has also been observed in the <unk> ( Diptera ) , whose larvae dig the same sort of pit to feed on ants . Having marked out the chosen site by a circular groove , the antlion larva starts to crawl backwards , using its abdomen as a plough to shovel up the soil . By the aid of one front leg , it places consecutive heaps of loosened particles upon its head , then with a smart jerk throws each little pile clear of the scene of operations . Proceeding thus , it gradually works its way from the circumference towards the center . As it slowly moves round and round , the pit gradually gets deeper and deeper , until the slope angle reaches the critical angle of repose ( that is , the steepest angle the sand can maintain , where it is on the verge of collapse from slight disturbance ) . When the pit is completed , the larva settles down at the bottom , buried in the soil with only the jaws projecting above the surface , often in a wide @-@ opened position on either side of the very tip of the cone . The steep @-@ sloped trap that guides prey into the larva 's mouth while avoiding crater avalanches is one of the simplest and most efficient traps in the animal kingdom . Since the sides of the pit consist of loose sand at its angle of repose , they afford an insecure foothold to any small insects that inadvertently venture over the edge , such as ants . Slipping to the bottom , the prey is immediately seized by the lurking antlion ; if it attempts to scramble up the treacherous walls of the pit , it is speedily checked in its efforts and brought down by showers of loose sand which are thrown at it from below by the larva . By throwing up loose sand from the bottom of the pit , the larva also undermines the sides of the pit , causing them to collapse and bring the prey with them . Thus , it does not matter whether the larva actually strikes the prey with the sand showers . 
 Antlion larvae are capable of capturing and killing a variety of insects and other arthropods , and can even subdue small spiders . The projections in the jaws of the larva are hollow and through this , the larva sucks the fluids out of its victim . After the contents are consumed , the dry carcass is flicked out of the pit . The larva readies the pit once again by throwing out collapsed material from the center , steepening the pit walls to the angle of repose . 
 Antlion larvae require loose soil , not necessarily but often sand . The larvae prefer dry places protected from the rain . When it first hatches , the tiny larva specialises in very small insects , but as it grows larger , it constructs larger pits , and thus catches larger prey , sometimes much larger than itself . 
 Other arthropods may make use of the antlion larva 's ability to trap prey . The larva of the Australian horsefly ( <unk> <unk> ) lives in antlion pit traps and feeds on the prey caught , and the female chalcid wasp ( <unk> <unk> ) purposefully allows itself to be trapped so that it can parasitise the antlion larva by ovipositing between its head and thorax .

 The closest living relatives of antlions within the Myrmeleontoidea are the <unk> ( <unk> ) ; the <unk> are more distantly related . The extinct <unk> and <unk> are considered likely to be stem groups in the Myrmeleontiformia clade . The phylogeny of the Neuroptera has been explored using mitochondrial DNA sequences , and while issues remain for the group as a whole ( the " <unk> " being paraphyletic ) , the Myrmeleontiformia is generally agreed to be monophyletic , giving the following cladogram : 
 The subfamilies are shown below ; a few genera , mostly fossil , are of uncertain or basal position . The fossil record of antlions is very small by <unk> standards . However , some Mesozoic fossils attest to the antlions ' origin more than 150 million years ago . These were at one time separated as the <unk> , but are now usually recognized as early antlions .

 In popular folklore in the southern United States , people recite a poem or chant to make the antlion come out of its hole . Similar practices have been recorded from Africa , the Caribbean , China and Australia . 
 The <unk> was a mythical ant @-@ lion hybrid written about in the 2nd century AD Physiologus , where animal descriptions were paired with Christian morals . The ant @-@ lion as described was said to starve to death because of its dual nature – the lion nature of the father could only eat meat , but the ant half from the mother could only eat grain chaff , thus the offspring could not eat either and would starve . It was paired with the Biblical verse Matthew 5 : 37 The fictional ant @-@ lion of Physiologus is probably derived from a misreading of Job 4 : 11 . 
 The French naturalist Jean @-@ Henri Fabre wrote that " The Ant @-@ lion makes a slanting funnel in the sand . Its victim , the Ant , slides down the slant and is then stoned , from the bottom of the funnel , by the hunter , who turns his neck into a catapult . " 
 = Tet Offensive = 
 The Tet Offensive ( Vietnamese : <unk> <unk> Tết Mậu <unk> 1968 , or <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> <unk> Tết Mậu <unk> ) was one of the largest military campaigns of the Vietnam War , launched on January 30 , 1968 , by forces of the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese People 's Army of Vietnam against the forces of the South Vietnamese Army of the Republic of Vietnam , the United States , and their allies . It was a campaign of surprise attacks against military and civilian commands and control centers throughout South Vietnam . The name of the offensive comes from the Tết holiday , the Vietnamese New Year , when the first major attacks took place . 
 The North Vietnamese launched a wave of attacks in the late night hours of 30 January in the I and II Corps Tactical Zones of South Vietnam . This early attack did not lead to widespread defensive measures . When the main North Vietnamese operation began the next morning the offensive was countrywide and well coordinated , eventually more than 80 @,@ 000 North Vietnamese troops striking more than 100 towns and cities , including 36 of 44 provincial capitals , five of the six autonomous cities , 72 of 245 district towns , and the southern capital . The offensive was the largest military operation conducted by either side up to that point in the war . 
 Though initial attacks stunned both the US and South Vietnamese armies , causing them to temporarily lose control of several cities , they quickly regrouped , beat back the attacks , and inflicted heavy casualties on North Vietnamese forces . During the Battle of Huế , intense fighting lasted for a month , resulting in the destruction of the city by US forces . During their occupation , the North Vietnamese executed thousands of people in the Massacre at Huế . Around the US combat base at Khe Sanh fighting continued for two more months . Although the offensive was a military defeat for North Vietnam , it had a profound effect on the US government and shocked the US public , which had been led to believe by its political and military leaders that the North Vietnamese were being defeated and incapable of launching such an ambitious military operation . U.S. public support for the war declined and the U.S. sought negotiations to end the war . 
 The term " Tet offensive " usually refers to the January – February 1968 offensive , but it can also include the so @-@ called " Mini @-@ Tet " offensives that took place in May and August .

 During the fall of 1967 , the question of whether the U.S. strategy of attrition was working in South Vietnam weighed heavily on the minds of the American public and the administration of President Lyndon B. Johnson . General William C. Westmoreland , the commander of the Military Assistance Command , Vietnam ( MACV ) believed that if a " crossover point " could be reached by which the number of communist troops killed or captured during military operations exceeded those recruited or replaced , the Americans would win the war . There was a discrepancy , however , between MACV and the Central Intelligence Agency 's ( CIA ) order of battle estimates concerning the strength of Viet Cong guerrilla forces within South Vietnam . In September , members of the MACV intelligence services and the CIA met to prepare a Special National Intelligence Estimate that would be used by the administration as a gauge of U.S. success in the conflict . 
 Provided with an enemy intelligence windfall accrued during Operations Cedar Falls and Junction City , the CIA members of the group believed that the number of Viet Cong guerrillas , irregulars , and cadre within the South could be as high as 430 @,@ 000 . The MACV Combined Intelligence Center , on the other hand , maintained that the number could be no more than 300 @,@ 000 . Westmoreland was deeply concerned about the possible perceptions of the American public to such an increased estimate , since communist troop strength was routinely provided to reporters during press briefings . According to MACV 's chief of intelligence , General Joseph A. <unk> , the new figures " would create a political bombshell " , since they were positive proof that the North Vietnamese " had the capability and the will to continue a protracted war of attrition . " 
 In May , MACV attempted to obtain a compromise from the CIA by maintaining that Viet Cong militias did not constitute a fighting force but were essentially low level fifth columnists used for information collection . The agency responded that such a notion was ridiculous , since the militias were directly responsible for half of the casualties inflicted on U.S. forces . With the groups deadlocked , George Carver , CIA deputy director for Vietnamese affairs , was asked to mediate the dispute . In September , Carver devised a compromise : The CIA would drop its insistence on including the irregulars in the final tally of forces and add a prose addendum to the estimate that would explain the agency 's position . George Allen , Carver 's deputy , laid responsibility for the agency 's capitulation at the feet of Richard Helms , the director of the CIA . He believed that " it was a political problem ... [ Helms ] didn 't want the agency ... contravening the policy interest of the administration . " 
 During the second half of 1967 the administration had become alarmed by criticism , both inside and outside the government , and by reports of declining public support for its Vietnam policies . According to public opinion polls , the percentage of Americans who believed that the U.S. had made a mistake by sending troops to Vietnam had risen from 25 percent in 1965 to 45 percent by December 1967 . This trend was fueled not by a belief that the struggle was not worthwhile , but by mounting casualty figures , rising taxes , and the feeling that there was no end to the war in sight . A poll taken in November indicated that 55 percent wanted a tougher war policy , exemplified by the public belief that " it was an error for us to have gotten involved in Vietnam in the first place . But now that we 're there , let 's win – or get out . " This prompted the administration to launch a so @-@ called " Success Offensive " , a concerted effort to alter the widespread public perception that the war had reached a stalemate and to convince the American people that the administration 's policies were succeeding . Under the leadership of National Security Advisor Walt W. Rostow , the news media then was inundated by a wave of effusive optimism . 
 Every statistical indicator of progress , from " kill ratios " and " body counts " to village pacification , was fed to the press and to the Congress . " We are beginning to win this struggle " asserted Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey on NBC 's Today show in mid @-@ November . " We are on the offensive . Territory is being gained . We are making steady progress . " At the end of November , the campaign reached its climax when Johnson summoned Westmoreland and the new U.S. Ambassador , Ellsworth Bunker , to Washington , D.C. , for what was billed as a " high level policy review " . Upon their arrival , the two men bolstered the administration 's claims of success . From Saigon , pacification chief Robert <unk> asserted that the <unk> pacification program in the countryside was succeeding , and that sixty @-@ eight percent of the South Vietnamese population was under the control of Saigon while only seventeen percent was under the control of the Viet Cong . General Bruce Palmer , Jr . , one of Westmoreland 's three Field Force commanders , claimed that " the Viet Cong has been defeated " and that " He can 't get food and he can 't recruit . He has been forced to change his strategy from trying to control the people on the coast to trying to survive in the mountains . " 
 Westmoreland was even more emphatic in his assertions . At an address at the National Press Club on 21 November he reported that , as of the end of 1967 , the communists were " unable to mount a major offensive ... I am absolutely certain that whereas in 1965 the enemy was winning , today he is certainly losing ... We have reached an important point when the end begins to come into view . " By the end of the year the administration 's approval rating had indeed crept up by eight percent , but an early January Gallup poll indicated that forty @-@ seven percent of the American public still disapproved of the President 's handling of the war . The American public , " more confused than convinced , more doubtful than despairing ... adopted a ' wait and see ' attitude . " During a discussion with an interviewer from Time magazine , Westmoreland defied the communists to launch an attack : " I hope they try something , because we are looking for a fight . "

 Planning in Hanoi for a winter @-@ spring offensive during 1968 had begun in early 1967 and continued until early the following year . According to American sources , there has been an extreme reluctance among Vietnamese historians to discuss the decision @-@ making process that led to the General Offensive General Uprising , even decades after the event . In official Vietnamese literature , the decision to launch the Tet Offensive was usually presented as the result of a perceived U.S. failure to win the war quickly , the failure of the American bombing campaign against North Vietnam , and the anti @-@ war sentiment that pervaded the population of the U.S. The decision to launch the general offensive , however , was much more complicated . 
 The decision signaled the end of a bitter , decade @-@ long debate within the North Vietnamese Government between first two , and then three factions . The moderates believed that the economic viability of North Vietnam should come before support of a massive and conventional southern war and they generally followed the Soviet line of peaceful coexistence by reunifying Vietnam through political means . Heading this faction were party theoretician Trường Chinh and Minister of Defense Võ Nguyên Giáp . The militant faction , on the other hand , tended to follow the foreign policy line of the People 's Republic of China and called for the reunification of the nation by military means and that no negotiations should be undertaken with the Americans . This group was led by Communist Party First Secretary Lê Duẩn and Lê Đức Thọ ( no relation ) . From the early @-@ to @-@ mid @-@ 1960s , the militants had dictated the direction of the war in South Vietnam . 
 General Nguyễn Chí Thanh the head of Central Office for South Vietnam ( COSVN ) , headquarters for the South , was another prominent militant . The followers of the Chinese line centered their strategy against the US and its allies on large @-@ scale , main force actions rather than the protracted guerrilla war espoused by Mao Zedong . 
 By 1966 – 1967 , however , after suffering massive casualties , stalemate on the battlefield , and destruction of the northern economy by U.S. aerial bombing , there was a dawning realization that , if current trends continued , Hanoi would eventually lack the resources necessary to affect the military situation in the South . As a result , there were more strident calls by the moderates for negotiations and a revision of strategy . They felt that a return to guerrilla tactics was more appropriate since the U.S. could not be defeated conventionally . They also complained that the policy of rejecting negotiations was in error . The Americans could only be worn down in a war of wills during a period of " fighting while talking . " During 1967 things had become so bad on the battlefield that Lê Duẩn ordered Thanh to incorporate aspects of protracted guerrilla warfare into his strategy . 
 During the same period , a counter @-@ attack was launched by a new , third grouping ( the centrists ) led by President Hồ Chí Minh , Lê Đức Thọ , and Foreign Minister Nguyễn Duy Trinh , who called for negotiations . From October 1966 through April 1967 , a very public debate over military strategy took place in print and via radio between Thanh and his rival for military power , Giáp . Giáp had advocated a defensive , primarily guerrilla strategy against the U.S. and South Vietnam . Thanh 's position was that Giáp and his adherents were centered on their experiences during the First Indochina War and that they were too " conservative and captive to old methods and past experience ... mechanically repeating the past . " 
 The arguments over domestic and military strategy also carried a foreign policy element as well , because North Vietnam , as the South Vietnamese forces , was largely dependent on outside military and economic aid . The vast majority of North Vietnam military equipment was provided by either the Soviet Union or China . Beijing advocated that North Vietnam conduct a protracted war on the Maoist model , fearing that a conventional conflict might draw them in as it had in the Korean War . They also resisted the idea of negotiating with the allies . Moscow , on the other hand , advocated negotiations , but simultaneously armed Hanoi 's forces to conduct a conventional war on the Soviet model . North Vietnamese foreign policy , therefore consisted of maintaining a critical balance between war policy , internal and external policies , domestic adversaries , and foreign allies with " self @-@ serving agendas . " 
 To " break the will of their domestic opponents and reaffirm their autonomy vis @-@ à @-@ vis their foreign allies " hundreds of pro @-@ Soviet , party moderates , military officers , and intelligentsia were arrested on 27 July 1967 , during what came to be called the Revisionist Anti @-@ Party Affair . All of the arrests were based on the individual 's stance on the Politburo 's choice of tactics and strategy for the proposed General Offensive . This move cemented the position of the militants as Hanoi 's strategy : The rejection of negotiations , the abandonment of protracted warfare , and the focus on the offensive in the towns and cities of South Vietnam . More arrests followed in November and December . 
 = = = = General Offensive and Uprising = = = = 
 The operational plan for the General Offensive and Uprising had its origin as the " COSVN proposal " at Thanh 's southern headquarters in April 1967 and had then been relayed to Hanoi the following month . The general was then ordered to the capital to explain his concept in person to the Military Central Commission . At a meeting in July , Thanh briefed the plan to the Politburo . On the evening of 6 July , after receiving permission to begin preparations for the offensive , Thanh attended a party and died of a heart attack after drinking too much . 
 After cementing their position during the Party crackdown , the militants sped up planning for a major conventional offensive to break the military deadlock . They concluded that the Saigon government and the U.S. presence were so unpopular with the population of the South that a broad @-@ based attack would spark a spontaneous uprising of the population , which , if the offensive was successful , would enable the North Vietnamese to sweep to a quick , decisive victory . Their basis for this conclusion included : a belief that the South Vietnamese military was no longer combat @-@ effective ; the results of the September 1967 South Vietnamese presidential election ( in which the Nguyễn Văn Thiệu / Nguyễn Cao Kỳ ticket had only received 24 percent of the popular vote ) ; the Buddhist crises of 1963 and 1966 ; well @-@ publicized anti @-@ war demonstrations in Saigon ; and continuous criticism of the Thiệu government in the southern press . Launching such an offensive would also finally put an end to what have been described as " <unk> calls for talks , criticism of military strategy , Chinese diatribes of Soviet perfidy , and Soviet pressure to negotiate — all of which needed to be silenced . " 
 In October , the Politburo decided on the Tet holiday as the launch date and met again in December to reaffirm its decision and formalize it at the 14th Plenary session of the Party Central Committee in January 1968 . The resultant Resolution 14 was a major blow to domestic opposition and " foreign obstruction . " Concessions had been made to the center group , however , by agreeing that negotiations were possible , but the document essentially centered on the creation of " a spontaneous uprising in order to win a decisive victory in the shortest time possible . " 
 Contrary to Western belief , General Giáp did not plan or command the offensive himself . Thanh 's original plan was elaborated on by a party committee headed by Thanh 's deputy , Phạm Hùng , and then modified by Giáp . The Defense Minister may have been convinced to toe the line by the arrest and imprisonment of most of the members of his staff during the Revisionist Anti @-@ Communist Party Affair . Although Giáp went to work " reluctantly , under duress " , he may have found the task easier due to the fact that he was faced with a fait accompli . Since the Politburo had already approved the offensive , all he had to do was make it work . He combined guerrilla operations into what was basically a conventional military offensive and shifted the burden of sparking the popular uprising to the Viet Cong . If it worked , all would be well and good . If it failed , it would be a failure only for the Communist Party militants . For the moderates and centrists , it offered the prospect of negotiations and a possible end to the American bombing of the North . Only in the eyes of the militants , therefore , did the offensive become a " go for broke " effort . Others in the Politburo were willing to settle for a much less ambitious " victory . " 
 The operation would involve a preliminary phase , during which diversionary attacks would be launched in the border areas of South Vietnam to draw American attention and forces away from the cities . The General Offensive , General Uprising would then commence with simultaneous actions on major allied bases and most urban areas , and with particular emphasis on the cities of Saigon and Huế . Concurrently , a substantial threat would have to be made against the U.S. combat base at Khe Sanh . The Khe Sanh actions would draw North Vietnamese forces away from the offensive into the cities , but Giáp considered them necessary in order to protect his supply lines and divert American attention . Attacks on other U.S. forces were of secondary , or even tertiary importance , since Giáp considered his main objective to be weakening or destroying the South Vietnamese military and government through popular revolt . The offensive , therefore was aimed at influencing the South Vietnamese public , not that of the U.S. There is conflicting evidence as to whether , or to what extent , the offensive was intended to influence either the March primaries or the November presidential election in the U.S. 
 According to General Trần Văn Trà , the new military head of COSVN , the offensive was to have three distinct phases : Phase I , scheduled to begin on 30 January , would be a countrywide assault on the cities , conducted primarily by Viet Cong forces . Concurrently , a propaganda offensive to induce ARVN troops to desert and the South Vietnamese population to rise up against the government would be launched . If outright victory was not achieved , the battle might still lead to the creation of a coalition government and the withdrawal of the Americans . If the general offensive failed to achieve these purposes , follow @-@ up operations would be conducted to wear down the enemy and lead to a negotiated settlement ; Phase II was scheduled to begin on 5 May , and Phase III on 17 August . 
 Preparations for the offensive were already underway . The logistical build @-@ up began in mid @-@ year , and by January 1968 , 81 @,@ 000 tons of supplies and 200 @,@ 000 troops , including seven complete infantry regiments and 20 independent battalions made the trip south on the Ho Chi Minh Trail . This logistical effort also involved re @-@ arming the Viet Cong with new AK @-@ 47 assault rifles and B @-@ 40 rocket @-@ propelled grenade launchers , which granted them superior firepower over their less well @-@ armed ARVN opponents . To pave the way and to confuse the allies as to its intentions , Hanoi launched a diplomatic offensive . Foreign Minister Trinh announced on 30 December that Hanoi would rather than could open negotiations if the U.S. unconditionally ended Operation Rolling Thunder , the bombing campaign against North Vietnam . This announcement provoked a flurry of diplomatic activity ( which amounted to nothing ) during the last weeks of the year . 
 South Vietnamese and U.S. military intelligence estimated that North Vietnamese and Viet Cong forces in South Vietnam during January 1968 totaled 323 @,@ 000 men , including 130 @,@ 000 North Vietnamese regulars , 160 @,@ 000 Viet Cong and members of the infrastructure , and 33 @,@ 000 service and support troops . They were organized into nine divisions composed of 35 infantry and 20 artillery or anti @-@ aircraft artillery regiments , which were , in turn , composed of 230 infantry and six sapper battalions .

 Signs of impending communist action did not go unnoticed among the allied intelligence collection apparatus in Saigon . During the late summer and fall of 1967 both South Vietnamese and U.S. intelligence agencies collected clues that indicated a significant shift in communist strategic planning . By mid @-@ December , mounting evidence convinced many in Washington and Saigon that something big was underway . During the last three months of the year intelligence agencies had observed signs of a major North Vietnamese military buildup . In addition to captured documents ( a copy of Resolution 13 , for example , was captured by early October ) , observations of enemy logistical operations were also quite clear : in October , the number of trucks observed heading south through Laos on the Hồ Chí Minh Trail jumped from the previous monthly average of 480 to 1 @,@ 116 . By November this total reached 3 @,@ 823 and , in December , 6 @,@ 315 . On 20 December , Westmoreland cabled Washington that he expected the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese " to undertake an intensified countrywide effort , perhaps a maximum effort , over a relatively short period of time . " 
 Despite all the warning signs , however , the allies were still surprised by the scale and scope of the offensive . According to ARVN Colonel Hoang Ngoc Lung the answer lay with the allied intelligence methodology itself , which tended to estimate the enemy 's probable course of action based upon their capabilities , not their intentions . Since , in the allied estimation , the communists hardly had the capability to launch such an ambitious enterprise : " There was little possibility that the enemy could initiate a general offensive , regardless of his intentions . " The answer could also be partially explained by the lack of coordination and cooperation between competing intelligence branches , both South Vietnamese and American . The situation from the U.S. perspective was best summed up by an MACV intelligence analyst : " If we 'd gotten the whole battle plan , it wouldn 't have been believed . It wouldn 't have been credible to us . " 
 From spring through the fall of 1967 , the U.S. Command in Saigon was perplexed by a series of actions initiated by the North Vietnamese and the Viet Cong in the border regions . On 24 April a U.S. Marine Corps patrol prematurely triggered a North Vietnamese offensive aimed at taking the airstrip and combat base at Khe Sanh , the western anchor of the Marines ' defensive positions in Quảng Trị Province . By the time the action there had ended in May , 940 North Vietnamese troops and 155 Marines had been killed . For 49 days during early September and lasting into October , the North Vietnamese began shelling the U.S. Marine outpost of Con Thien , just south of the Demilitarized Zone or DMZ . The intense shelling ( 100 – 150 rounds per day ) prompted Westmoreland to launch Operation <unk> , an intense aerial bombardment campaign of 4 @,@ 000 sorties into and just north of the demarcation line . 
 On 27 October , an ARVN battalion at Sông Bé , the capital of Phước Long Province , came under attack by an entire North Vietnamese regiment . Two days later , another North Vietnamese Regiment attacked a U.S. Special Forces border outpost at Lộc Ninh , in Bình Long Province . This attack sparked a ten @-@ day battle that drew in elements of the U.S. 1st Infantry Division and the ARVN 18th Division and left 800 North Vietnamese troops dead at its conclusion . 
 The most severe of what came to be known as " the Border Battles " erupted during October and November around Dak To , another border outpost in Kon Tum Province . The clashes there between the four regiments of the 1st North Vietnamese Division , the U.S. 4th Infantry Division , the U.S. 173rd Airborne Brigade , and ARVN infantry and Airborne elements , lasted for 22 days . By the time the fighting was over , between 1 @,@ 200 and 1 @,@ 600 North Vietnamese and 262 U.S. troops had lost their lives . MACV intelligence was confused by the possible motives of the North Vietnamese in prompting such large @-@ scale actions in remote regions where U.S. artillery and aerial firepower could be applied indiscriminately , which meant that tactically and strategically , these operations made no sense . What the North Vietnamese had done was carry out the first stage of their plan : to fix the attention of the U.S. Command on the borders and draw the bulk of U.S. forces away from the heavily populated coastal lowlands and cities . 
 Westmoreland was more concerned with the situation at Khe Sanh , where , on 21 January , a force estimated at 20 @,@ 000 – 40 @,@ 000 North Vietnamese troops had besieged the U.S. Marine garrison . MACV was convinced that the North Vietnamese planned to stage an attack and overrun the base as a prelude to an all @-@ out effort to seize the two northernmost provinces of South Vietnam . To deter any such possibility , he deployed 250 @,@ 000 men , including half of MACV 's U.S. maneuver battalions , to the I Corps Tactical Zone . 
 This course of events disturbed Lieutenant General Frederick Weyand , commander of U.S. forces in III Corps , which included the Capital Military District . Weyand , a former intelligence officer , was suspicious of the pattern of communist activities in his area of responsibility and notified Westmoreland of his concerns on 10 January . Westmoreland agreed with his estimate and ordered 15 U.S. battalions to redeploy from positions near the Cambodian border back to the outskirts of Saigon . When the offensive did begin , a total of 27 allied maneuver battalions defended the city and the surrounding area . This redeployment may have been one of the most critical tactical decisions of the war . 
 = = = = Before the offensive = = = = 
 By the beginning of January 1968 , the U.S had deployed 331 @,@ 098 Army personnel and 78 @,@ 013 Marines in nine divisions , an armoured cavalry regiment , and two separate brigades to South Vietnam . They were joined there by the 1st Australian Task Force , a Royal Thai Army regiment , two South Korean infantry divisions , and a Republic of Korea Marine Corps brigade . South Vietnamese strength totaled 350 @,@ 000 regulars in the Army , Air Force , Navy , and Marine Corps . They were in turn supported by the 151 @,@ 000 @-@ man South Vietnamese Regional Forces and 149 @,@ 000 @-@ man South Vietnamese Popular Forces , which were the equivalent of regional and local militias . 
 In the days immediately preceding the offensive , the preparedness of allied forces was relatively relaxed . Hanoi had announced in October that it would observe a seven @-@ day truce from 27 January to 3 February for the Tet holiday , and the South Vietnamese military made plans to allow recreational leave for approximately half of its forces . General Westmoreland , who had already cancelled the truce in I Corps , requested that its ally cancel the upcoming cease @-@ fire , but President Thiệu ( who had already reduced the cease @-@ fire to 36 hours ) , refused to do so , claiming that it would damage troop morale and only benefit communist propagandists . 
 On 28 January , eleven Viet Cong cadres were captured in the city of Qui Nhơn while in possession of two pre @-@ recorded audio tapes whose message appealed to the populace in " already occupied Saigon , Huế , and Da Nang . " The following afternoon , General Cao Văn Viên , chief of the Vietnamese Joint General Staff , ordered his four corps commanders to place their troops on alert . Yet , there was still a lack of a sense of urgency on the part of the allies . If Westmoreland had a grasp of the potential for danger , he did not communicate it very well to others . On the evening of 30 January , 200 U.S. officers — all of whom served on the MACV intelligence staff — attended a pool party at their quarters in Saigon . According to James Meecham , an analyst at the Combined Intelligence Center who attended the party : " I had no conception Tet was coming , absolutely zero ... Of the 200 @-@ odd officers present , not one I talked to knew Tet was coming , without exception . " 
 The general also failed to communicate his concerns adequately to Washington . Although he had warned the President between 25 and 30 January that " widespread " communist attacks were in the offing , his admonitions had tended to be so oblique or so hedged with official optimism that even the administration was unprepared . No one – in either Washington or Vietnam – was expecting what happened . 
 = = Offensive = = 
 " Crack the Sky , Shake the Earth " 
 Whether by accident or design , the first wave of attacks began shortly after midnight on 30 January as all five provincial capitals in II Corps and Da Nang , in I Corps , were attacked . Nha Trang , headquarters of the U.S. I Field Force , was the first to be hit , followed shortly by Ban <unk> Thuột , Kon Tum , Hội An , Tuy Hòa , Da Nang , Qui Nhơn , and Pleiku . During all of these operations , the Viet Cong and North Vietnamese followed a similar pattern : mortar or rocket attacks were closely followed by massed ground assaults conducted by battalion @-@ strength elements of the Viet Cong , sometimes supported by North Vietnamese regulars . These forces would join with local cadres who served as guides to lead the regulars to the most senior South Vietnamese headquarters and the radio station . The operations , however , were not well coordinated at the local level . By daylight , almost all communist forces had been driven from their objectives . General Phillip B. Davidson , the new MACV chief of intelligence , notified Westmoreland that " This is going to happen in the rest of the country tonight and tomorrow morning . " All U.S. forces were placed on maximum alert and similar orders were issued to all ARVN units . The allies , however , still responded without any real sense of urgency . Orders cancelling leaves either came too late or were disregarded . 
 At 03 : 00 on 31 January North Vietnamese forces assailed Saigon , Cholon , and Gia Định in the Capital Military District ; Quảng Trị ( again ) , Huế , Quảng Tín , Tam Kỳ , and Quảng Ngãi as well as U.S. bases at Phú <unk> and Chu Lai in I Corps ; Phan Thiết , Tuy Hòa , and U.S. installations at Bong Son and An Khê in II Corps ; and Cần Thơ and Vĩnh Long in IV Corps . The following day , Biên Hòa , Long Thanh , Bình Dương in III Corps and Kien Hoa , Dinh Tuong , Gò Công , Kiên Giang , Vĩnh Bình , Bến Tre , and Kien Tuong in IV Corps were assaulted . The last attack of the initial operation was launched against <unk> <unk> in IV Corps on 10 February . A total of approximately 84 @,@ 000 Viet Cong and North Vietnamese troops participated in the attacks while thousands of others stood by to act as reinforcements or as blocking forces . Viet Cong and North Vietnamese forces also mortared or rocketed every major allied airfield and attacked 64 district capitals and scores of smaller towns . 
 In most cases , the defense against the communists was a South Vietnamese affair . Local militia or ARVN forces , supported by the National Police , usually drove the attackers out within two or three days , sometimes within hours ; but heavy fighting continued several days longer in Kon Tum , <unk> Ma Thuột , Phan Thiết , Cần Thơ , and Bến Tre . The outcome in each instance was usually dictated by the ability of local commanders — some were outstanding , others were cowardly or incompetent . During this crucial crisis , however , no South Vietnamese unit broke or defected to the communists . 
 According to Westmoreland , he responded to the news of the attacks with optimism , both in media presentations and in his reports to Washington . According to closer observers , however , the general was " stunned that the communists had been able to coordinate so many attacks in such secrecy " and he was " dispirited and deeply shaken . " According to Clark Clifford , at the time of the initial attacks , the reaction of the U.S. military leadership " approached panic " . Although Westmoreland 's appraisal of the military situation was correct , he made himself look foolish by continuously maintaining his belief that Khe Sanh was the real objective of the North Vietnamese and that 155 attacks by 84 @,@ 000 troops was a diversion ( a position he maintained until at least 12 February ) . Washington Post reporter Peter <unk> summed up the feelings of his colleagues by asking " How could any effort against Saigon , especially downtown Saigon , be a diversion ? " 
 = = = Saigon = = = 
 Although Saigon was the focal point of the offensive , the communists did not seek a total takeover of the city . Rather , they had six primary targets to strike in the downtown area : the headquarters of the ARVN General Staff at Tan Son Nhut Air Base ; the Independence Palace , the US Embassy , Saigon , the Republic of Vietnam Navy Headquarters , and the National Radio Station . These objectives were all assaulted by a small number of militants of the local C @-@ 10 Sapper Battalion . Elsewhere in the city or its outskirts , ten Viet Cong Local Force Battalions attacked the central police station and the Artillery Command and the Armored Command headquarters ( both at Gò <unk> ) . The plan called for all these initial forces to capture and hold their positions for 48 hours , by which time reinforcements were to have arrived to relieve them . 
 The defense of the Capital Military Zone was primarily a South Vietnamese responsibility and it was initially defended by eight ARVN infantry battalions and the local police force . By 3 February they had been reinforced by five ARVN Ranger Battalions , five Marine Corps , and five ARVN Airborne Battalions . U.S. Army units participating in the defense included the 716th Military Police Battalion , seven infantry battalions ( one mechanized ) , and six artillery battalions . 
 At the Armored Command and Artillery Command headquarters on the northern edge of the city the North Vietnamese planned to use captured tanks and artillery pieces but the tanks had been moved to another base two months earlier and that the breech blocks of the artillery pieces had been removed , rendering them useless . 
 One of the most important Viet Cong targets , from a symbolic and propagandistic point of view , was the National Radio Station . Its troops had brought along a tape recording of Hồ Chi Minh announcing the liberation of Saigon and calling for a " General Uprising " against the Thiệu government . They seized the building , held it for six hours and , when running out of ammunition , the last eight attackers destroyed it and sacrificed themselves using explosive charges , but they were unable to broadcast due to the cutting off of the audio lines from the main studio to the tower as soon as the station was seized . 
 The US Embassy , Saigon , a massive six @-@ floor building situated within a four @-@ acre compound , had only been completed in September . At 02 : 45 it was attacked by a 19 @-@ man sapper team that blew a hole in the 8 @-@ foot @-@ high ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) surrounding wall and charged through . With their officers killed in the initial attack and their attempt to gain access to the building having failed , the sappers simply occupied the chancery grounds until they were all killed or captured by US reinforcements that were landed on the roof of the building six hours later . By 09 : 20 the embassy and grounds were secured , with the loss of five US personnel . 
 At 03 : 00 on 31 January , twelve Vietcong sappers approached the Vietnamese Navy Headquarters in two civilian cars , killing two guards at a barricade at Me Linh Square and then advanced towards the base gate . The sound of gunfire alerted base sentries who secured the gate and sounded the alarm . A .30 @-@ caliber machine gun on the second floor of the headquarters disabled both cars and killed or wounded several sappers while the Navy security force organized a counterattack . Simultaneously a U.S. Navy advisor contacted the U.S. military police who soon attacked the Vietcong from adjoining streets , the resulting crossfire ended the attack , killing eight sappers with two captured . 
 Small squads of Viet Cong fanned out across the city to attack various officers and enlisted men 's billets , homes of ARVN officers , and district police stations . Provided with " blacklists " of military officers and civil servants , they began to round up and execute any that could be found . 
 On 1 February General Nguyễn Ngọc Loan , chief of the National Police , publicly executed Viet Cong officer Nguyễn Văn <unk> captured in civilian clothing in front of photographer Edward T. Adams and a film cameraman . That photography , with the title of Saigon Execution won the 1969 Pulitzer Prize for Spot News Photography and it 's widely seen as a defining moment in the Vietnam War for its influence on public opinion in the United States about the war , even being called " the picture that lost the war " . 
 Outside the city proper two Viet Cong battalions attacked the U.S. logistical and headquarters complex at Long Binh . Biên Hòa Air Base was struck by a battalion , while the adjacent ARVN III Corps headquarters was the objective of another . Tan Son Nhut Air Base , in the northwestern part of the city , was attacked by three battalions . A combat @-@ ready battalion of ARVN paratroopers , awaiting transport to Da Nang , went instead directly into action and halted the attack . A total of 35 communist battalions , many of whose troops were undercover cadres who had lived and worked within the capital or its environs for years , had been committed to the Saigon objectives . By dawn most of the attacks within the city center had been eliminated , but severe fighting between Viet Cong and allied forces erupted in the Chinese neighborhood of Cholon around the Phú Thọ racetrack , southwest of the city center , which was being used as a staging area and command and control center by the North Vietnamese . Bitter and destructive house @-@ to @-@ house fighting erupted in the area . On 4 February , the residents were ordered to leave their homes and the area was declared a free fire zone . Fighting in the city came to a close only after a fierce battle between the ARVN Rangers and PAVN forces on 7 March . 
 Except at Huế and mopping @-@ up operations in and around Saigon , the first surge of the offensive was over by the second week of February . The U.S. estimated that during the first phase ( 30 January – 8 April ) approximately 45 @,@ 000 PAVN soldiers were killed and an unknown number were wounded . For years this figure has been held as excessively optimistic , as it represented more than half the forces involved in this battle . Stanley Karnow claims he confirmed this figure in Hanoi in 1981 . Westmoreland himself claimed a smaller number of enemies disabled , estimating that during the same period 32 @,@ 000 PAVN troops were killed and another 5 @,@ 800 captured . The South Vietnamese suffered 2 @,@ 788 killed , 8 @,@ 299 wounded , and 587 missing in action . U.S. and other allied forces suffered 1 @,@ 536 killed , 7 @,@ 764 wounded , and 11 missing . 
 = = = Huế = = = 
 At 03 : 40 on the foggy morning of 31 January , allied defensive positions north of the Perfume River in the city of Huế were mortared and rocketed and then attacked by two battalions of the 6th PAVN Regiment . Their target was the ARVN 1st Division headquarters located in the Citadel , a three @-@ square mile complex of palaces , parks , and residences , which were surrounded by a moat and a massive earth and masonry fortress built at the beginning of the 19th century by Emperor Gia Long . The undermanned ARVN defenders , led by General Ngô Quang Trưởng , managed to hold their position , but the majority of the Citadel fell to the PAVN . On the south bank of the river , the 4th PAVN Regiment attempted to seize the local MACV headquarters , but was held at bay by a makeshift force of approximately 200 Americans . The rest of the city was overrun by PAVN forces which initially totaled approximately 7 @,@ 500 men . Both sides then rushed to reinforce and resupply their forces . Lasting 25 days , the battle of Huế became one of the longest and bloodiest single battles of the Vietnam War . 
 During the first days of the North Vietnamese occupation , U.S. intelligence vastly underestimated the number of PAVN troops and little appreciated the effort that was going to be necessary to evict them . General Westmoreland informed the Joint Chiefs that " the enemy has approximately three companies in the Huế Citadel and the marines have sent a battalion into the area to clear them out . " Since there were no U.S. formations stationed in Huế , relief forces had to move up from Phu Bai , eight kilometers to the southeast . In a misty drizzle , U.S. Marines of the 1st Marine Division and soldiers of the 1st ARVN Division and Marine Corps cleared the city street by street and house by house , a deadly and destructive form of urban combat that the U.S. military had not engaged in since the Battle of Seoul during the Korean War , and for which neither side were trained . Because of the historical and cultural significance of the city , American forces did not immediately apply air and artillery strikes as widely as they had in other cities . 
 Outside Huế , elements of the U.S. 1st Air Cavalry Division and the 101st Airborne Division fought to seal PAVN access and cut off their lines of supply and reinforcement . By this point in the battle 16 to 18 PAVN battalions ( 8 @,@ 000 @-@ 11 @,@ 000 men ) were taking part in the fighting for the city itself or the approaches to the former imperial capital . Two of the North Vietnamese regiments had made a forced march from the vicinity of Khe Sanh to Huế in order to participate . During most of February , the allies gradually fought their way towards the Citadel , which was only taken after four days of intense struggle . The city was not declared recaptured by U.S. and ARVN forces until 24 February , when members of the 2nd Battalion , 3rd Regiment , 1st ARVN Division raised the South Vietnamese flag over the Palace of Perfect Peace . 
 During the intense action , the allies estimated that North Vietnamese forces had between 1 @,@ 042 and 5 @,@ 000 killed and 89 captured in the city and in the surrounding area . 216 U.S. Marines and soldiers had been killed during the fighting and 1 @,@ 609 were wounded . 421 ARVN troops were killed , another 2 @,@ 123 were wounded , and 31 were missing . More than 5 @,@ 800 civilians had lost their lives during the battle and 116 @,@ 000 were left homeless out of an original population of 140 @,@ 000 . 40 @-@ 50 % of Huế was destroyed by the end of the battle . 
 In the aftermath of the recapture of the city , the discovery of several mass graves ( the last of which were uncovered in 1970 ) of South Vietnamese citizens of Huế sparked a controversy that has not diminished with time . The victims had either been clubbed or shot to death or simply buried alive . The official allied explanation was that during their initial occupation of the city , the PAVN had quickly begun to systematically round up ( under the guise of re @-@ education ) and then execute as many as 2 @,@ 800 South Vietnamese civilians that they believed to be potentially hostile to communist control . Those taken into custody included South Vietnamese military personnel , present and former government officials , local civil servants , teachers , policemen , and religious figures . Historian Gunther Lewy claimed that a captured Viet Cong document stated that the communists had " eliminated 1 @,@ 892 administrative personnel , 38 policemen , 790 tyrants . " The North Vietnamese officer , Bùi Tín , later further muddied the waters by stating that their forces had indeed rounded up " reactionary " captives for transport to the North , but that local commanders , under battlefield exigencies , had executed them for expediency 's sake . 
 General Ngô Quang Trưởng , commander of the 1st ARVN Division , believed that the captives had been executed by the communists in order to protect the identities of members of the local Viet Cong infrastructure , whose covers had been blown . The exact circumstances leading to the deaths of those citizens of Huế discovered in the mass graves may never be known exactly , but most of the victims were killed as a result of PAVN and NLF executions , considering evidence from captured documents and witness testimonies among other things . 
 = = = Khe Sanh = = = 
 The attack on Khe Sanh , which began on 21 January before the other offensives , may have been intended to serve two purposes — as a real attempt to seize the position or as a diversion to draw American attention and forces away from the population centers in the lowlands , a deception that was " both plausible and easy to orchestrate . " In General Westmoreland 's view , the purpose of the Combat Base was to provoke the North Vietnamese into a focused and prolonged confrontation in a confined geographic area , one which would allow the application of massive U.S. artillery and air strikes that would inflict heavy casualties in a relatively unpopulated region . By the end of 1967 , MACV had moved nearly half of its maneuver battalions to I Corps in anticipation of just such a battle . 
 Westmoreland — and the American media , which covered the action extensively — often made inevitable comparisons between the actions at Khe Sanh and the Battle of Điện Biên Phủ , where a French base had been besieged and ultimately overrun by Viet Minh forces under the command of General Giáp during the First Indochina War . Westmoreland , who knew of Nguyen Chi Thanh 's penchant for large @-@ scale operations — but not of his death — believed that this was going to be an attempt to replicate that victory . He intended to stage his own " Dien Bien Phu in reverse . " 
 Khe Sanh and its 6 @,@ 000 U.S. Marine Corps , Army , and ARVN defenders was surrounded by two to three North Vietnamese divisions , totaling approximately 20 @,@ 000 men . Throughout the siege , which lasted until 8 April , the allies were subjected to heavy mortar , rocket , and artillery bombardment , combined with sporadic small @-@ scale infantry attacks on outlying positions . With the exception of the overrunning of the U.S. Special Forces camp at Lang Vei , however , there was never a major ground assault on the base and the battle became largely a duel between American and North Vietnamese artillerists , combined with massive air strikes conducted by U.S. aircraft . By the end of the siege , U.S Air Force , Marine Corps , and Navy aircraft had dropped 39 @,@ 179 tons of ordnance in the defense of the base . 
 The overland supply route to the base had been cut off , and airborne resupply by cargo aircraft became extremely dangerous due to heavy North Vietnamese antiaircraft fire . Thanks to innovative high @-@ speed " Super <unk> " , which utilized fighter @-@ bombers in combination with large numbers of supply helicopters , and the Air Force 's utilization of C @-@ 130 Hercules cargo aircraft employing the innovative <unk> delivery method , aerial resupply was never halted . 
 When the Tet Offensive began , feelings ran high at MACV that the base was in for a serious attack . In I Corps , the Tet Truce had been cancelled in apprehension of a communist assault that never happened . The offensive passed Khe Sanh by and the intermittent battle continued . Westmoreland 's fixation upon the base continued even as the battle raged around him in Saigon . On 1 February , as the offensive reached its height , he wrote a memo for his staff — which was never delivered — claiming that " The enemy is attempting to confuse the issue ... I suspect he is also trying to draw everyone 's attention from the area of greatest threat , the northern part of I Corps . Let me caution everyone not to be confused . " 
 In the end , a major allied relief expedition ( Operation Pegasus ) launched by all three brigades of the First Cavalry Division reached Khe Sanh on 8 April , but North Vietnamese forces were already withdrawing from the area . Both sides claimed that the battle had served its intended purpose . The MACV estimated that 5 @,@ 500 North Vietnamese troops had been killed and considerably more wounded . During Operation Pegasus , 730 American lives lost and another 2 @,@ 642 wounded . 
 = = = Phases II and III = = = 
 To further enhance their political posture at the Paris talks , which opened on 13 May , the North Vietnamese opened the second phase of the General Offensive in late April . U.S. intelligence sources estimated between February and May the North Vietnamese dispatched 50 @,@ 000 men down the Ho Chi Minh Trail to replace losses incurred during the earlier fighting . Some of the most prolonged and vicious combat of the war opened on 29 April and lasted until 30 May when the 8 @,@ 000 men of the 320th PAVN Division , backed by artillery from across the DMZ , threatened the U.S. logistical base at Đông Hà , in northwestern Quảng Trị Province . In what became known as the Battle of Dai Do , the North Vietnamese clashed savagely with U.S. Marine , Army , and ARVN forces before withdrawing . The North Vietnamese lost an estimated 2 @,@ 100 men after inflicting casualties on the allies of 290 killed and 946 wounded . 
 During the early morning hours of 4 May , communist units initiated the second phase of the offensive ( known by the South Vietnamese and Americans as " Mini @-@ Tet " ) by striking 119 targets throughout South Vietnam , including Saigon . This time , however , allied intelligence was better prepared , stripping away the element of surprise . Most of the communist forces were intercepted by allied screening elements before they reached their targets . 13 Viet Cong battalions , however , managed to slip through the cordon and once again plunged the capital into chaos . Severe fighting occurred at Phu Lam , ( where it took two days to root out the 267th Viet Cong Local Force Battalion ) , around the Y @-@ Bridge , and at Tan Son Nhut . By 12 May , however , it was all over . Viet Cong forces withdrew from the area leaving behind over 3 @,@ 000 dead . 
 The fighting had no sooner died down around Saigon than U.S. forces in Quảng Tín Province suffered what was , without doubt , the most serious American defeat of the war . On 10 May , two regiments of the 2nd PAVN Division attacked Kham Duc , the last Special Forces border surveillance camp in I Corps . 1 @,@ 800 U.S. and South Vietnamese troops were isolated and under intense attack when MACV made the decision to avoid a situation reminiscent of that at Khe Sanh . Kham Duc was evacuated by air while under fire , and abandoned to the North Vietnamese . 
 The communists returned to Saigon on 25 May and launched a second wave of attacks on the city . The fighting during this phase differed from Tet Mau Than and " Mini @-@ Tet " in that no U.S. installations were attacked . During this series of actions , Viet Cong forces occupied six Buddhist pagodas in the mistaken belief that they would be immune from artillery and air attack . The fiercest fighting once again took place in Cholon . One notable event occurred on 18 June when 152 members of the Viet Cong 's Quyet Thang Regiment surrendered to ARVN forces , the largest communist surrender of the war . The actions also brought more death and suffering to the city 's inhabitants . A further 87 @,@ 000 were made homeless while more than 500 were killed and another 4 @,@ 500 were wounded . During the second phase ( 5 May – 30 May ) U.S. casualties amounted to 1 @,@ 161 killed and 3 @,@ 954 wounded , while 143 South Vietnamese servicemen were killed and another 643 were wounded . 
 Phase III of the offensive began on 17 August and involved attacks in I , II , and III Corps . Significantly , during this series of actions only North Vietnamese forces participated . The main offensive was preceded by attacks on the border towns of Tây Ninh , An Lộc , and Loc Ninh , which were initiated in order to draw defensive forces from the cities . A thrust against Da Nang was preempted by the U.S. Marines on 16 August . Continuing their border @-@ clearing operations , three North Vietnamese regiments asserted heavy pressure on the U.S. Special Forces camp at Bu Prang , in Quang Duc Province , five kilometers from the Cambodian border . The fighting lasted for two days before the North Vietnamese broke it off ; the combat resulted in the deaths of 776 North Vietnamese , 114 South Vietnamese , and two Americans . 
 Saigon was struck again during this phase , but the attacks were less sustained and once again easily repulsed . As far as MACV was concerned , the August offensive " was a dismal failure . " In five weeks of fighting and after the loss of 20 @,@ 000 troops , not a single objective had been attained during this " final and decisive phase . " Yet , as historian Ronald Spector has pointed out " the communist failures were not final or decisive either . " During the same period 700 U.S. troops were killed in action . 
 The horrendous casualties and suffering endured by communist units during these sustained operations were beginning to tell . The fact that there were no apparent military gains made that could possibly justify all the blood and effort just exacerbated the situation . During the first half of 1969 , more than 20 @,@ 000 communist troops rallied to allied forces , a threefold increase over the 1968 figure . On 5 April 1969 , COSVN issued Directive 55 to all of its subordinate units : " Never again and under no circumstances are we going to risk our entire military force for just such an offensive . On the contrary , we should endeavor to preserve our military potential for future campaigns . " 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 = = = North Vietnam = = = 
 The leadership in Hanoi was despondent at the outcome of their offensive . Their first and most ambitious goal , producing a general uprising , had ended in a dismal failure . In total , approximately 85 @,@ 000 – 100 @,@ 000 communist troops had participated in the initial onslaught and in the follow @-@ up phases . Overall , during the " Border Battles " of 1967 and the nine @-@ month winter @-@ spring campaign , 45 @,@ 267 communist troops had been killed in action . 
 The keys to the failure of Tet are not difficult to discern . Hanoi had underestimated the strategic mobility of the allied forces , which allowed them to redeploy at will to threatened areas ; their battle plan was too complex and difficult to coordinate , which was amply demonstrated by the 30 January attacks ; their violation of the principle of mass , attacking everywhere instead of concentrating their forces on a few specific targets , allowed their forces to be defeated piecemeal ; the launching of massed attacks headlong into the teeth of vastly superior firepower ; and last , but not least , the incorrect assumptions upon which the entire campaign was based . According to General Tran Van Tra : " We did not correctly evaluate the specific balance of forces between ourselves and the enemy , did not fully realize that the enemy still had considerable capabilities , and that our capabilities were limited , and set requirements that were beyond our actual strength . 
 The communist effort to regain control of the countryside was somewhat more successful . According to the U.S. State Department the Viet Cong " made pacification virtually inoperative . In the Mekong Delta the Viet Cong was stronger now than ever and in other regions the countryside belongs to the VC . " General Wheeler reported that the offensive had brought counterinsurgency programs to a halt and " that to a large extent , the V.C. now controlled the countryside . " Unfortunately for the Viet Cong , this state of affairs did not last . Heavy casualties and the backlash of the South Vietnamese and Americans resulted in more territorial losses and heavy casualties . 
 The horrendous losses inflicted on Viet Cong units struck into the heart of the irreplaceable infrastructure that had been built up for over a decade . MACV estimated that 181 @,@ 149 Viet Cong and North Vietnamese troops had been killed during 1968 . From this point forward , Hanoi was forced to fill one @-@ third of the Viet Cong 's ranks with North Vietnamese regulars . However , this change had little effect on the war , since North Vietnam had little difficulty making up the casualties inflicted by the offensive . Some Western historians have come to believe that one insidious ulterior motive for the campaign was the elimination of competing southern members of the Party , thereby allowing the northerners more control once the war was won . 
 It was not until after the conclusion of the first phase of the offensive that Hanoi realized that its sacrifices might not have been in vain . General Tran Do , North Vietnamese commander at the battle of Huế , gave some insight into how defeat was translated into victory : 
 " In all honesty , we didn 't achieve our main objective , which was to spur uprisings throughout the South . Still , we inflicted heavy casualties on the Americans and their puppets , and this was a big gain for us . As for making an impact in the United States , it had not been our intention — but it turned out to be a fortunate result " . 
 On 5 May Trường Chinh rose to address a congress of Party members and proceeded to castigate the Party militants and their bid for quick victory . His " faction @-@ bashing " tirade sparked a serious debate within the party leadership which lasted for four months . As the leader of the " main force war " and " quick victory " faction , Lê Duẩn also came under severe criticism . In August , Chinh 's report on the situation was accepted in toto , published , and broadcast via Radio Hanoi . He had single @-@ handedly shifted the nation 's war strategy and restored himself to prominence as the Party 's ideological conscience . Meanwhile , the Viet Cong proclaimed itself the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam , and took part in future peace negotiations under this title . It would be a long seven years until victory . 
 = = = South Vietnam = = = 
 South Vietnam was a nation in turmoil both during and in the aftermath of the offensive . Tragedy had compounded tragedy as the conflict reached into the nation 's cities for the first time . As government troops pulled back to defend the urban areas , the Viet Cong moved in to fill the vacuum in the countryside . The violence and destruction witnessed during the offensive left a deep psychological scar on the South Vietnamese civilian population . Confidence in the government was shaken , since the offensive seemed to reveal that even with massive American support , the government could not protect its citizens . 
 The human and material cost to South Vietnam was staggering . The number of civilian dead was estimated by the government at 14 @,@ 300 with an additional 24 @,@ 000 wounded . 630 @,@ 000 new refugees had been generated , joining the nearly 800 @,@ 000 others already displaced by the war . By the end of 1968 , one of every twelve South Vietnamese was living in a refugee camp . More than 70 @,@ 000 homes had been destroyed in the fighting and perhaps 30 @,@ 000 more were heavily damaged and the nation 's infrastructure had been virtually destroyed . The South Vietnamese military , although it had performed better than the Americans had expected , suffered from lowered morale , with desertion rates rising from 10 @.@ 5 per thousand before Tet to 16 @.@ 5 per thousand by July . 1968 became the deadliest year of the war to date for the ARVN with 27 @,@ 915 men killed . 
 Moreover , in addition to the heavy civilian casualties inflicted in the battle by U.S. forces to retake the cities from the NLF and NVA , the presence of NLF fighters in the villages exposed their rural bases to attack . Writes Marilyn B. Young : 
 In Long An province , for example , local guerrillas taking part in the May — June offensive had been divided into several sections . Only 775 out of 2 @,@ 018 in one section survived ; another lost all but 640 out of 1 @,@ 430 . The province itself was subjected to what one historian has called a " My Lai from the Sky " – non @-@ stop B @-@ 52 bombing . 
 In the wake of the offensive , however , fresh determination was exhibited by the Thiệu government . On 1 February Thiệu declared a state of martial law and , on 15 June , the National Assembly passed his request for a general mobilization of the population and the induction of 200 @,@ 000 draftees into the armed forces by the end of the year ( a decree that had failed to pass only five months previously due to strong political opposition ) . This increase would bring South Vietnam 's troop strength to more than 900 @,@ 000 men . Military mobilization , anti @-@ corruption campaigns , demonstrations of political unity , and administrative reforms were quickly carried out . Thiệu also established a National Recovery Committee to oversee food distribution , resettlement , and housing construction for the new refugees . Both the government and the Americans were encouraged by a new determination that was exhibited among the ordinary citizens of the Republic . Many urban dwellers were indignant that the communists had launched their attacks during Tet and it drove many who had been previously apathetic into active support of the government . Journalists , political figures , and religious leaders alike — even the militant Buddhists — professed confidence in the government 's plans . 
 Thiệu saw an opportunity to consolidate his personal power and he took it . His only real political rival was Vice President Kỳ , the former Air Force commander , who had been outmaneuvered by Thiệu in the presidential election of 1967 . In the aftermath of Tet , Kỳ supporters in the military and the administration were quickly removed from power , arrested , or exiled . A crack @-@ down on the South Vietnamese press also ensued and there was a worrisome return of former President Ngô Đình Diệm 's Cần Lao Party members to high positions in the government and military . By the summer of 1968 , the President had earned a less exalted sobriquet among the South Vietnamese population , who had begun to call him " the little dictator . " 
 Thiệu had also become very suspicious of his American allies , unwilling to believe ( as did many South Vietnamese ) that the U.S. had been caught by surprise by the offensive . " Now that it 's all over " , he queried a visiting Washington official , " you really knew it was coming didn 't you ? " Lyndon Johnson 's unilateral decision on 31 March to curtail the bombing of North Vietnam only confirmed what Thiệu already feared , that the Americans were going to abandon South Vietnam to the communists . For Thiệu , the bombing halt and the beginning of negotiations with the North brought not the hope of an end to the war , but " an abiding fear of peace . " He was only mollified after an 18 July meeting with Johnson in Honolulu , where the American president affirmed that Saigon would be a full partner in all negotiations and that the U.S. would not " support the imposition of a coalition government , or any other form of government , on the people of South Vietnam . "

 The Tet Offensive created a crisis within the Johnson administration , which became increasingly unable to convince the American public that it had been a major defeat for the communists . The optimistic assessments made prior to the offensive by the administration and the Pentagon came under heavy criticism and ridicule as the " credibility gap " that had opened in 1967 widened into a chasm . 
 The shocks that reverberated from the battlefield continued to widen : On 18 February 1968 MACV posted the highest U.S. casualty figures for a single week during the entire war : 543 killed and 2 @,@ 547 wounded . As a result of the heavy fighting , 1968 went on to become the deadliest year of the war for the US forces with 16 @,@ 592 soldiers killed . On 23 February the U.S. Selective Service System announced a new draft call for 48 @,@ 000 men , the second highest of the war . On 28 February Robert S. McNamara , the Secretary of Defense who had overseen the escalation of the war in 1964 – 1965 , but who had eventually turned against it , stepped down from office . 
 = = = = Troop request = = = = 
 During the first two weeks of February , Generals Westmoreland and Wheeler communicated as to the necessity for reinforcements or troop increases in Vietnam . Westmoreland insisted that he only needed those forces either in @-@ country or already scheduled for deployment and he was puzzled by the sense of unwarranted urgency in Wheeler 's queries . Westmoreland was tempted , however , when Wheeler emphasized that the White House might loosen restraints and allow operations in Laos , Cambodia , or possibly even North Vietnam itself . On 8 February , Westmoreland responded that he could use another division " if operations in Laos are authorized " . Wheeler responded by challenging Westmoreland 's assessment of the situation , pointing out dangers that his on @-@ the @-@ spot commander did not consider palpable , concluding : " In summary , if you need more troops , ask for them . " 
 Wheeler 's bizarre promptings were influenced by the severe strain imposed upon the U.S. military by the Vietnam commitment , one which had been undertaken without the mobilization of its reserve forces . The Joint Chiefs had repeatedly requested national mobilization , not only to prepare for a possible intensification of the war , but also to ensure that the nation 's strategic reserve did not become depleted . By obliquely ordering Westmoreland to demand more forces , Wheeler was attempting to solve two pressing problems . In comparison with MACV 's previous communications , which had been full of confidence , optimism , and resolve , Westmoreland 's 12 February request for 10 @,@ 500 troops was much more urgent : " which I desperately need ... time is of the essence . " On 13 February , 10 @,@ 500 previously authorized U.S. airborne troops and marines were dispatched to South Vietnam . The Joint Chiefs then played their hand , advising President Johnson to turn down MACV 's requested division @-@ sized reinforcement unless he called up some 1 @,@ 234 @,@ 001 marine and army reservists . 
 Johnson dispatched Wheeler to Saigon on 20 February to determine military requirements in response to the offensive . Both Wheeler and Westmoreland were elated that in only eight days McNamara would be replaced by the hawkish Clark Clifford and that the military might finally obtain permission to widen the war . Wheeler 's written report of the trip , however , contained no mention of any new contingencies , strategies , or the building up the strategic reserve . It was couched in grave language that suggested that the 206 @,@ 756 @-@ man request it proposed was a matter of vital military necessity . Westmoreland wrote in his memoir that Wheeler had deliberately concealed the truth of the matter in order to force the issue of the strategic reserve upon the President . 
 On 27 February , Johnson and McNamara discussed the proposed troop increase . To fulfill it would require an increase in overall military strength of about 400 @,@ 000 men and the expenditure of an additional $ 10 billion during fiscal 1969 and another $ 15 billion in 1970 . These monetary concerns were pressing . Throughout the fall of 1967 and the spring of 1968 , the U.S. was struggling with " one of the most severe monetary crises " of the period . Without a new tax bill and budgetary cuts , the nation would face even higher inflation " and the possible collapse of the monetary system " . Johnson 's friend Clifford was concerned about what the American public would think of the escalation : " How do we avoid creating the feeling that we are pounding troops down a <unk> ? " 
 According to the Pentagon Papers , " A fork in the road had been reached and the alternatives stood out in stark reality . " To meet Wheeler 's request would mean a total U.S. military commitment to South Vietnam . " To deny it , or to attempt to cut it to a size which could be sustained by the thinly stretched active forces , would just as surely signify that an upper limit to the U.S. military commitment in South Vietnam had been reached . " 
 = = = = Reassessment = = = = 
 To evaluate Westmoreland 's request and its possible impact on domestic politics , Johnson convened the " Clifford Group " on 28 February and tasked its members with a complete policy reassessment . Some of the members argued that the offensive represented an opportunity to defeat the North Vietnamese on American terms while others pointed out that neither side could win militarily , that North Vietnam could match any troop increase , that the bombing of the North be halted , and that a change in strategy was required that would seek not victory , but the staying power required to reach a negotiated settlement . This would require a less aggressive strategy that was designed to protect the population of South Vietnam . The divided group 's final report , issued on 4 March , " failed to seize the opportunity to change directions ... and seemed to recommend that we continue rather haltingly down the same road . " 
 On 1 March , Clifford had succeeded McNamara as Secretary of Defense . During the month , Clifford , who had entered office as a staunch supporter of the Vietnam commitment and who had opposed McNamara 's de @-@ <unk> views , turned against the war . According to Clifford : " The simple truth was that the military failed to sustain a respectable argument for their position . " Between the results of Tet and the meetings of the group that bore his name , he became convinced that <unk> was the only solution for the United States . He believed that the troop increase would lead only to a more violent stalemate and sought out others in the administration to assist him in convincing the President to reverse the escalation , to cap force levels at 550 @,@ 000 men , to seek negotiations with Hanoi , and turn responsibility for the fighting over to the South Vietnamese . Clifford quietly sought allies and was assisted in his effort by the so @-@ called " 8 : 30 Group " – Nitze , Warnke , Phil G. Goulding ( Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs ) , George Elsey , and Air Force Colonel Robert E. <unk> . 
 On 27 February , Secretary of State Dean Rusk had proposed that a partial bombing halt be implemented in North Vietnam and that an offer to negotiate be extended to Hanoi . On 4 March , Rusk reiterated the proposal , explaining that , during the rainy season in the North , bombing was less effective and that no military sacrifice would thus occur . This was purely a political ploy , however , since the North Vietnamese would probably again refuse to negotiate , casting the onus on them and " thus freeing our hand after a short period ... putting the monkey firmly upon Hanoi 's back for what was to follow . " 
 While this was being deliberated , the troop request was leaked to the press and published in The New York Times on 10 March . The article also revealed that the request had begun a serious debate within the administration . According to it , many high @-@ level officials believed that the U.S. troop increase would be matched by the communists and would simply maintain a stalemate at a higher level of violence . It went on to state that officials were saying in private that " widespread and deep changes in attitudes , a sense that a watershed has been reached . " 
 A great deal has been said by historians concerning how the news media made Tet the " turning point " in the public 's perception of the war . Popular CBS anchor Walter Cronkite stated during a news broadcast on February 27 , " We have been too often disappointed by the optimism of the American leaders , both in Vietnam and Washington , to have faith any longer in the silver linings they find in the darkest clouds " and added that , " we are mired in a stalemate that could only be ended by negotiation , not victory . " Far from suffering a loss of morale , however , the majority of Americans had rallied to the side of the president . A Gallup poll in January 1968 revealed that 56 percent polled considered themselves hawks on the war and 27 percent doves , with 17 percent offering no opinion . By early February , at the height of the first phase of the offensive , 61 percent declared themselves hawks , 23 percent doves , and 16 percent held no opinion . Johnson , however , made few comments to the press during or immediately after the offensive , leaving an impression of indecision on the public . It was this lack of communication that caused a rising disapproval rating for his conduct of the war . By the end of February , his approval rating had fallen from 63 percent to 47 percent . By the end of March the percentage of Americans that expressed confidence in U.S. military policies in Southeast Asia had fallen from 74 to 54 percent . 
 By 22 March , President Johnson had informed Wheeler to " forget the 100 @,@ 000 " men . The President and his staff were refining a lesser version of the troop increase – a planned call @-@ up of 62 @,@ 000 reservists , 13 @,@ 000 of whom would be sent to Vietnam . Three days later , at Clifford 's suggestion , Johnson called a conclave of the " Wise Men " . With few exceptions , all of the members of the group had formerly been accounted as hawks on the war . The group was joined by Rusk , Wheeler , Bundy , Rostow , and Clifford . The final assessment of the majority stupefied the group . According to Clifford , " few of them were thinking solely of Vietnam anymore " . All but four members called for disengagement from the war , leaving the President " deeply shaken . " According to the Pentagon Papers , the advice of the group was decisive in convincing Johnson to reduce the bombing of North Vietnam . 
 Lyndon Johnson was depressed and despondent at the course of recent events . The New York Times article had been released just two days before the Democratic Party ( United States ) ' s New Hampshire primary , where the President suffered an unexpected setback in the election , finishing barely ahead of Senator Eugene McCarthy . Soon afterward , Senator Robert F. Kennedy announced he would join the contest for the Democratic nomination , further emphasizing the plummeting support for Johnson 's administration in the wake of Tet . 
 The President was to make a televised address to the nation on Vietnam policy on 31 March and was deliberating on both the troop request and his response to the military situation . By 28 March Clifford was working hard to convince him to tone down his hard @-@ line speech , maintaining force levels at their present size , and instituting Rusk 's bombing / negotiating proposal . To Clifford 's surprise , both Rusk and Rostow ( both of whom had previously been opposed to any form of <unk> ) offered no opposition to Clifford 's suggestions . On 31 March , President Johnson announced the unilateral ( although still partial ) bombing halt during his television address . He then stunned the nation by declining to run for a second term in office . To Washington 's surprise , on 3 April Hanoi announced that it would conduct negotiations , which were scheduled to begin on 13 May in Paris . 
 On 9 June , President Johnson replaced Westmoreland as commander of MACV with General Creighton W. Abrams . Although the decision had been made in December 1967 and Westmoreland was made Army Chief of Staff , many saw his relief as punishment for the entire Tet debacle . Abrams ' new strategy was quickly demonstrated by the closure of the " strategic " Khe Sanh base and the ending of multi @-@ division " search and destroy " operations . Also gone were discussions of victory over North Vietnam . Abrams ' new " One War " policy centered the American effort on the takeover of the fighting by the South Vietnamese ( through Vietnamization ) , the pacification of the countryside , and the destruction of communist logistics . The new administration of President Richard M. Nixon would oversee the withdrawal of U.S. forces and the continuation of negotiations .

 Afterburn is a steel inverted roller coaster located at Carowinds amusement park . After more than two years of planning and construction , the roller coaster opened on March 20 , 1999 . The ride previously operated as Top Gun : The Jet Coaster , before it was renamed Afterburn following Cedar Fair 's purchase of the park in 2006 . 
 Designed by Bolliger & Mabillard , Afterburn stands 113 feet ( 34 m ) tall and reaches speeds of 62 miles per hour ( 100 km / h ) . It features a 2 @,@ 956 @-@ foot @-@ long ( 901 m ) track and a nearly three @-@ minute @-@ long ride time . Afterburn has generally been well received , having been featured several times as a top 50 roller coaster in Amusement Today 's Golden Ticket Awards . 
 = = History = = 
 In early 1997 , Paramount 's Carowinds began consultations with roller coaster manufacturer Bolliger & Mabillard about adding a new ride to their park . During 18 months of discussions , several designs and themes for the ride were developed , including theming it to the Godzilla franchise . In July 1998 , the park announced the addition of Top Gun : The Jet Coaster for the 1999 season . At a cost of $ 10 @.@ 5 million , it would be the single biggest investment in the park 's history . The announcement followed Paramount Parks adding Top Gun @-@ themed inverted and suspended roller coasters to several of their parks throughout the 1990s , including Paramount 's Great America , Paramount Canada 's Wonderland , and Paramount 's Kings Island . To construct the attraction at Carowinds , the park 's Bayern Kurve ride , Wild Bull , had to be removed . The park intended to keep the ride in storage for a potential relocation elsewhere within the park . The removal of Wild Bull shortened construction time because no trees or buildings had to be removed . Construction began in late July 1998 , with the first track arriving in August . Testing was completed in January 1999 . 
 Top Gun : The Jet Coaster soft opened to guests and media on March 16 , 1999 . Riders of the first cycle included NASCAR drivers Stanton Barrett , Tony Stewart , Jerry Nadeau , and Kenny Wallace . The ride officially opened to the public on March 20 , 1999 . On July 1 , 2006 , the Cedar Fair Entertainment Company announced their acquisition of all of the Paramount Parks , including Carowinds . The aforementioned Top Gun roller coasters at other parks were all renamed to Flight Deck by the 2008 season , with Carowinds ' installation being renamed to Afterburn . For the 2014 season , the ride 's 15th season , Afterburn will receive a new coat of paint .

 As the train leaves the station , a recorded message , " Clear for Takeoff , " is played . Afterburn then climbs its chain lift hill , reaching a peak height of 113 feet ( 34 m ) . After a small pre @-@ drop , the roller coaster train then drops to the right before entering its first inversion , a vertical loop . Riders then travel through an underground trench and enter an Immelmann loop which sends the train in the opposite direction . The train then drops towards the ground , climbs back up , and spins through a zero @-@ g roll , an inverting element where riders experience the feeling of weightlessness . Afterwards , the train dives back towards the ground and enters the two @-@ inversion batwing element which crosses through a tunnel underneath the park 's rear entrance . 
 As Afterburn exits the batwing , it climbs through a camelback hill over the station before entering its final inversion , a corkscrew to the right . The train then begins a 270 @-@ degree climbing helix to the left , after which it reaches the ride 's brake run and returns to the station .

 Afterburn has been well received . Arthur Levine of About.com stated the ride " is among the best inverted coasters " he 's ridden , giving the ride a 4 out of 5 rating . Levine praises the ride for the lack of headbanging that results from over @-@ the @-@ shoulder @-@ restraints ( <unk> ) on many roller coasters . The Coaster Critic describes the " pacing and order of inversions [ as ] near perfect " , giving the ride an " excellent " rating of 9 out of 10 . 
 Afterburn has appeared in Amusement Today 's annual Golden Ticket Awards several times . It debuted at position 18 in 1999 , before disappearing from the poll for the three years to follow . The ride returned to the poll , before hitting a low of 45 in 2012 . 
 In Mitch Hawker 's worldwide Best Roller Coaster Poll , Afterburn entered at position 12 in 1999 , before slowly declining to a low of 41 in 2012 . The ride 's ranking in subsequent polls is shown in the table below . 
 = 1966 Syrian coup d 'état = 
 The 1966 Syrian coup d 'état refers to events between 21 and 23 February in which the government of the Syrian Arab Republic was overthrown and replaced . The ruling National Command of the Arab Socialist Ba 'ath Party were removed from power by a union of the party 's Military Committee and the Regional Command , under the leadership of Salah Jadid . 
 The coup was precipitated by a heightening in the power struggle between the party 's old guard , represented by Michel Aflaq , Salah al @-@ Din al @-@ Bitar , and Munif al @-@ Razzaz , and the younger factions adhering to a Neo @-@ Ba 'athist position . On 21 February , supporters of the old guard in the army ordered the transfer of their rivals . Two days later , the Military Committee , backing the younger factions , launched a coup that involved violent fighting in Aleppo , Damascus , Deir ez @-@ Zor , and Latakia . As a result of the coup , the party 's historical founders fled the country and spent the rest of their lives in exile . 
 Jadid 's government was the most radical administration in Syria 's history . The coup created a permanent schism between the Syrian and Iraqi regional branches of the Ba 'ath Party and their respective National Commands , with many senior Syrian Ba 'athists defecting to Iraq . As a legacy of the coup , during Jadid 's rule , Syria initiated a propaganda campaign against the Iraqi Ba 'athists . Jadid 's government would be overthrown in the Corrective Movement of 1970 , which brought Hafez al @-@ Assad to power .

 = = = Consolidation of power = = = 
 After taking power in the 1963 Syrian coup d 'état , officially the 8th of March Revolution , a power struggle broke erupted between the Nasserites in the National Council for the Revolutionary Command and the Ba 'ath Party . The Nasserites sought to reestablish the United Arab Republic , the former federation encompassing Egypt and Syria from 1958 to 1961 , on Gamal Abdel Nasser 's terms , the Ba 'athists were skeptical of a new union with Nasser , and wanted a loose federation where the Ba 'ath Party could rule Syria alone without interference . The Nasserites mobilised large street demonstrations in favour of a union . It took time before the Ba 'ath Party knew how to respond to the issue , since the majority of Syrian Arab Nationalists were not adherents to Ba 'athism , but of Nasserism and Nasser in general . 
 Instead of trying to win the support of the populace , the Ba 'athists moved to consolidate their control over the Syrian military . Several hundred Nasserites and conservatives were purged from the military , and Ba 'athists were recruited to fill senior positions . Most of the newly recruited Ba 'athist officers came from the countryside or from a low social class . These Ba 'athist officers replaced the chiefly " urban Sunni upper @-@ middle and middle class " officer corps , and replaced it with an officer corps with a rural background who more often the " kinsmen of the leading minority officer " . These changes led to the decimation of Sunni control over the military establishment . 
 The cost of clamping down on the protests was a loss of legitimacy , and the emergence of Amin al @-@ Hafiz as the first Ba 'athist military strongman . The traditional elite , consisting of the upper classes , who had been overthrown from political power by the Ba 'athists , felt threatened by the Ba 'ath Party 's socialist policies . The Muslim Brotherhood in Syria was a historical rival of the Syrian Regional Branch , and it felt threatened by the party 's secular nature . Akram al @-@ Hawrani and his supporters and the Syrian Communist Party opposed the one @-@ party system which the Ba 'ath Party was establishing . 
 The majority of Sunni Muslims were Arab nationalists , but not Ba 'athist , making them feel alienated . The party was chiefly dominated by minority groups such as Alawites , Druzes , and Isma <unk> , and people from the countryside in general ; this created an urban – rural conflict based predominantly on ethnic differences . With its coming to power , the Ba 'ath Party was threatened by the predominantly anti @-@ Ba 'athist sentiment in urban politics — probably the only reason why the Ba 'athists managed to stay in power was the rather weakly organised and fragmented opposition it faced . 
 = = = Conflict with the Aflaqites = = = 
 Cohesive internal unity had all but collapsed within after the 1963 seizure of power ; Michel Aflaq , Salah al @-@ Din al @-@ Bitar , and their followers wanted to implement " classic " Ba 'athism in the sense that they wanted to establish a loose union with Nasser 's Egypt , implement a moderate form of socialism , and to have a one @-@ party state which respected the rights of the individual , tolerating freedom of speech and freedom of thought . However , the Aflaqites ( or <unk> ) were quickly forced into the background , and at the 6th National Ba 'ath Party Congress , the Military Committee and their supporters succeeding in creating a new form of Ba 'athism – a Ba 'athism strongly influenced by Marxism – Leninism . This new form of Ba 'athism laid emphasis on " revolution in one country " rather than to unifying the Arab world . At the same time , the 6th National Congress implemented a resolution which stressed the implementation of a socialist revolution in Syria . Under this form of socialism , the economy as a whole would adhere to state planning and the commanding heights of the economy and foreign trade were to be nationalised . They believed these policies would end exploitation of labour , that capitalism would disappear , and in agriculture they envisioned a plan were land was given " to he who works it " . However , private enterprise would still exist in retail trade , construction , tourism , and small industry in general . These changes and more would refashion the Ba 'ath Party into a Leninist party . 
 In the aftermath of the 1964 riot in Hama and other cities , the radicals were on the retreat and the Aflaqites regained control for a brief period . Bitar formed a new government which halted the nationalisation process , reaffirm respect for civil liberties and private property . However , these policy changes did not win sufficient support , and the population at large still opposed Ba 'ath Party rule . The upper classes continued to <unk> capital and smuggle capital out of the country , and the only foreseeable solution to this loss of capital was continuing with nationalisation . The party 's left @-@ wing argued that the bourgeoisie would never be won over unless they were given total control over the economy as they had before . It was this power struggle between the moderate Aflaqites who dominated the National Command of the Ba 'ath Party and the radicals who dominated the Syrian Regional Command of the Ba 'ath Party which led to the 1966 coup d 'état . 
 = = Power struggle = = 
 Before the crushing of the riots of 1964 , a power struggle started within the Military Committee between Minister of Defence Muhammad Umran , and Salah Jadid . Umran , the committee 's most senior member , wanted reconciliation with the rioters and an end to confrontation with the middle class , in contrast , Jadid believed the solution was to coerce and repress the protesters so as to save the 8th of March Revolution . This was the first open schism within the Military Committee , and would prove decisive in coming events . With Hafez al @-@ Assad 's support , the Military Committee initiated a violent counter @-@ attack on the rioters This decision led to Umran 's downfall . He responded by revealing the Military Committee 's plan of taking over the Ba 'ath Party to the party 's National Command . Aflaq , the Secretary General of the National Command , responded to the information by ordering the dissolution of the Syrian Regional Command . He was forced to withdraw his request because the party 's rank @-@ and @-@ file rose in protest . When an old guard Ba 'athist <unk> asked Aflaq " how big a role his party still played in government " , Aflaq replied " About one @-@ thousandth of one percent " . Umran 's revelations to the National Command led to his exile , and with the National Command impotent , the Military Committee , through its control of the Syrian Regional Command , initiated an attack on the bourgeoisie and initiated a nationalisation drive which extended state ownership to electricity generation , oil distribution , cotton <unk> , and to an estimated 70 percent of foreign trade . 
 After Umran 's downfall , the National Command and the Military Committee continued their respective struggle for control of the Ba 'ath Party . While the National Command invoked party rules and regulations against the Military Committee , it was clear from the beginning that the initiative lay with the Military Committee . The reason for the Military Committee 's success was its alliance with the Regionalists , a group of branches which had not adhered to Aflaq 's 1958 orders to dissolve the Syrian Regional Branch . The Regionalists disliked Aflaq and opposed his leadership . Assad called the Regionalists the " true cells of the party " . 
 The power contest between the allied Military Committee and the Regionalists against the National Command was fought out within the party structure . However , the Military Committee and the Regionalists managed to turn the party structure on its head . At the 2nd Regional Congress ( held in March 1965 ) , it was decided to endorse the principle that the Regional Secretary of the Regional Command would be the ex officio head of state , and the Regional Command acquired the power to appoint the prime minister , the cabinet , the chief of staff , and the top military commanders . This change curtailed the powers of the National Command , who thenceforth had very little say in Syrian internal affairs . In response , at the 8th National Congress ( April 1965 ) Aflaq had originally planned to launch an attack on the Military Committee and the Regionalists , but was persuaded not to by fellow National Command members – most notably by a Lebanese member , <unk> Majdalani , and a Saudi member , Ali Ghannam – because it could lead to the removal of the party 's civilian leadership , as had occurred in the Iraqi Regional Branch . Because of this decision , Aflaq was voted from office as Secretary General , to be succeeded by fellow National Command member Munif al @-@ Razzaz . Razzaz was a Syrian @-@ born Jordanian who was not rooted enough in party politics to solve the crisis , even if under his command several joint meetings of the National and Regional Commands took place . Not longer after Aflaq 's loss of office , Hafiz , the Secretary of the Regional Command , changed his allegiance to support the National Command . While Hafiz was the de jure leader of Syria ( he held the offices of Regional Command secretary , Chairman of the Presidential Council , prime minister and commander @-@ in @-@ chief ) , it was Jadid , the Assistant Secretary General of the Regional Command , who was the de facto leader of Syria . 
 = = The coup = = 
 In November 1965 , the National Command issued a resolution which stated it was forbidden for the Regional Command to transfer or dismiss military officers without the consent of the National Command . After hearing of the resolution , Jadid rebelled immediately , and ordered Colonel Mustafa <unk> to arrest the commanders of the Homs garrison and his deputy , both supporters of National Command . In response , Razzaz called for an emergency session of the National Command which decreed the Regional Command dissolved , and made Bitar Prime Minister . Hafiz was made Chairman of a new Presidential Council and <unk> al @-@ <unk> his deputy . Umran was recalled from exile and reappointed to the office of Minister of Defence and commander @-@ in @-@ chief , and Mansur al @-@ Atrash was appointed Chairman of a new and expanded National Revolutionary Council . Jadid and his supporters responded by making war on the National Command . Assad , who neither liked nor had sympathy for the Aflaqites , did not support a showdown through the use of force . In response to the coming coup , Assad , along with Naji Jamil , Husayn <unk> and Yusuf Sayigh , left for London . 
 The coup began on 21 February 1966 when Umran tested his authority as Minister of Defence by ordering the transfer of three key Jadid supporters ; Major @-@ General Ahmad Suwaydani , Colonel Izzad Jadid and Major Salim Hatum . The Military Committee would respond the next day , but before that it staged a ruse which threw the National Command off balance . The ruse was that Abd al @-@ Ghani Ibrahim , the Alawi commander of the front facing Israel , reported to headquarters that a quarrel had broken out among front @-@ line officers , and that guns had been used . Umran , al @-@ Hafiz and the Chief of Staff left for the Golan Heights in a hurry for a lengthy discussion with the officer corps there ; when they returned at 3 am on 23 February they were exhausted . Two hours later , at 5 am , Jadid launched his coup . Not long after , the attack on al @-@ Hafiz 's private residence began , led by Salim Hatum and Rifaat al @-@ Assad , and supported by a squadron of tank units led by Izzad Jadid . Despite a spirited defence , Hafiz 's forces surrendered after all their ammunition was spent – Hafiz 's daughter lost an eye in the attacks . The commander of al @-@ Hafiz 's bodyguard , Mahmud Musa , was nearly killed by Izzad Jadid , but was saved and smuggled out of Syria by Hatum . There was resistance outside Damascus . In Hama , Tlass was forced to send forces from Homs to quell the uprising , while in Aleppo Aflaq loyalists briefly controlled the radio station and some resistance was reported in Latakia and Deir ez @-@ Zor . After their military defeats , resistance all but collapsed – Razzaz was the only National Command member to put up any organised resistance after the military defeats , issuing statements against the government from his different hiding places .

 = = = The new government = = = 
 Immediately after the coup , officers loyal to Umran and the Aflaqites were purged from the armed forces , being imprisoned alongside Umran at <unk> prison . One of the first acts of Jadid 's government was to appoint Assad Minister of Defence . Assad however , did not support the coup , and told Mansur al @-@ Atrash , <unk> Majdalani , and other Aflaqites that he did not support Jadid 's actions . Later , in an interview with Le Monde , Assad claimed that the military 's intervention was regrettable because the Ba 'ath Party was democratic , and that the disputes should have been resolved in a democratic manner . However , Assad did view the actions as necessary , as it put an end , in his view , to the dictatorship of the National Command . 
 Jadid 's government has been referred to as Syria 's most radical government in history . He initiated rash and radical policies internally and externally , and tried to overturn Syrian society from the top to the bottom . While Assad and Jadid agreed ideologically , they did not agree on how to implement these beliefs in practice . The Military Committee , which had been the officers ' key decision @-@ making process during 1963 – 66 , lost its central institutional authority under Jadid because the fight against the Aflaqites was over – the key reason for the committee 's existence in the first place . While Jadid never acquired , or took the offices of Prime Minister or President , instead opting to rule through the office of Assistant Secretary of the Regional Command , he was the undisputed ruler of Syria from 1966 to 1970 . Before the 1966 coup , Jadid had controlled the Syrian armed forces through his post as Head of the Bureau of Officers ' Affairs , but from 1966 onwards Jadid became absorbed with running the country , and in his place , Assad was given the task of controlling the armed forces . This would later prove to be a mistake , and lead to Jadid 's downfall in the 1970 Corrective Revolution . 
 Jadid appointed <unk> al @-@ Atassi as President , Regional Secretary of the Regional Command and Secretary General of the National Command , Yusuf Zu <unk> became Prime Minister again , and Ibrahim <unk> was appointed Minister of Foreign Affairs . Other personalities were former Head of Military Intelligence Ahmad al @-@ Suwaydani , who was appointed Chief of Staff , Colonel Muhammad Rabah al @-@ Tawil was appointed Minister of Labour and Head of the newly established Popular Resistance Forces , and Colonel Abd al @-@ Karim al @-@ <unk> , a founding member of the Military Committee , was appointed Minister of Agrarian Reform and later , Minister of Interior . 
 = = = Neo @-@ Ba 'athism = = = 
 Some believe , Avraham Ben @-@ Tzur being the most prominent writer on the subject , that the Ba 'athist ideology preached in Syria after the coup should be referred to as neo @-@ Ba 'athism since it has nothing to do with the ideology 's classic form espoused by Aflaq , Bitar and the Aflaqites in general . Munif al @-@ Razzaz agreed with the theory , stating that from 1961 onwards , there existed two Ba 'ath parties – " the military Ba 'ath Party and the Ba 'ath Party , and real power lay with the former . " He further noted that the military Ba 'ath ( as " paraphrased by Martin Seymour " ) " was and remains Ba 'athist only in name ; that it was and remains little more than a military clique with civilian hangers @-@ on ; and that from the initial founding of the Military Committee by disgruntled Syrian officers exiled in Cairo in 1959 , the chain of events and the total corruption of Ba 'athism proceeded with intolerable logic . " Bitar agreed , stating that the 1966 coup " marked the end of Ba 'athist politics in Syria . " Aflaq shared the sentiment , and stated ; " I no longer recognise my party ! " . 
 = = = The split = = = 
 The ousting of Aflaq , Bitar , and the National Command is the deepest schism in the Ba 'ath movement 's history . While there had been many schisms and splits in the Ba 'ath Party , Aflaq and Bitar always emerged as the victors , and remained party leaders , but the 1966 coup brought a new generation of leaders to power who had different aims to their predecessors . While Aflaq and Bitar still had supporters in Syria and in non @-@ Syrian Regional Branches , they were hampered by the lack of financial means – the Syrian Regional Branch had funded them since 1963 . Jadid and his supporters now had the Syrian state at their disposal , and were theoretically able to establish new party organisations or coerce pro @-@ Aflaq opinion , this failed to work since most of the regional branches changed their allegiance to Baghdad . Later in 1966 , the first post @-@ <unk> National Congress , officially designated the 9th , was held , and a new National Command was elected . Another change was to the ideological orientation of the Syrian Regional Branch and the new National Command ; while the Aflaqites believed in an all @-@ Arab Ba 'ath Party and the unification of the Arab world , the Syria 's new leaders saw this as impractical . Following the coup , the National Command became subservient in all but name to the Syrian Regional Command , and ceased to have an effective role in Arab or Syrian politics . 
 Following the exile of the National Command , some of its members , including Hafiz , convened the 9th Ba 'ath National Congress ( to differentiate it from the Syrian " 9th National Congress " ) and elected a new National Command , with Aflaq , who did not attend the congress , as the National Command 's Secretary General . For those like Bitar and Razzaz , the exile from Syria was too hard , and they left the party . Aflaq moved to Brazil , remaining there till 1968 . 
 = = = = Party @-@ to @-@ party relations = = = = 
 When the National Command was toppled in 1966 , the Iraqi Regional Branch remained , at least verbally , supportive of the " legitimate leadership " of Aflaq . When the Iraqi Regional Branch regained power in 1968 in the 17 July Revolution no attempts were made at a merger , to achieve their supposed goal of Arab unity , or reconciliation with the Syrian Ba 'ath . After the establishment of Ba 'ath rule in Iraq , many members of the Syrian @-@ dominated Ba 'ath movement defected to its Iraqi @-@ counterpart , few if any Iraqi @-@ loyal Ba 'athists attempted to change its allegiance to Damascus . The reason for this was that those defecting from Damascus were loyal to the old , <unk> National Command . Several older members such as Bitar , Hafiz , <unk> al @-@ <unk> and Elias Farah , either visited Iraq or sent a congratulatory message to Ahmed Hassan al @-@ Bakr , the Regional Secretary of the Iraqi Regional Command . Aflaq did not visit Iraq until 1969 , but from late @-@ 1970 , he would become a leading Iraqi Ba 'ath official , although he never acquired any decision @-@ making power . 
 From the beginning the Damascus government began an overwhelmingly anti @-@ Iraqi Ba 'athist propaganda campaign , to which their counterparts in Baghdad responded . However , the Iraqi Ba 'athists helped Assad , who at the 4th Regional Congress of the Syrian Regional Branch called for the reunification of the Ba 'ath Party , in his attempt to seize power from Jadid . It was reported that Assad promised the Iraqis to recognize Aflaq 's historical leadership . Iraq 's foreign minister Abd al @-@ Karim al @-@ <unk> even had his own personal office in the Syrian Ministry of Defence , which Assad headed . However , this should not be misconstrued , the Iraqi Regional Branch was Arab nationalist in name only , and was in fact Iraqi nationalist . 
 The Syrian Regional Branch began denouncing Aflaq as a " thief " . They claimed that he had stolen the Ba 'athist ideology from Zaki al @-@ Arsuzi and proclaimed it as his own , with Assad hailing Arsuzi as the principal founder of Ba 'athist thought . The Iraqi Regional Branch , however , still proclaimed Aflaq as the founder of Ba 'athism . Assad has referred to Arsuzi as the " greatest Syrian of his day " and claimed him to be the " first to conceive of the Ba 'ath as a political movement . " Aflaq was condemned to death in absentia in 1971 by Assad 's government . The Syrian Regional Branch erected a statue in Arsuzi 's honour not long after the 1966 coup . Nevertheless , the majority of Ba 'ath followers outside Syria still view Aflaq , not Arsuzi , as the principal founder of Ba 'athism . 
 When the Iraqi Regional Branch seized power , the Syrian Regional Branch responded by not mentioning in the press release that a Ba 'ath organisation had taken power in Iraq . For instance , it mentioned that Bakr had been appointed president , but did not mention his party 's affiliation , and instead referred to the incident as a military coup . While the Syrian Ba 'ath denied giving any legitimacy to Iraqi Ba 'ath , the Iraqi Ba 'ath were more conciliatory . For instance , Bakr stated " They are Ba 'athists , we are Ba 'athists " shortly after the Iraqi Regional Branch seized power . Foreign Minister <unk> stated shortly after that " there is nothing preventing co @-@ operation between us [ meaning Iraq and Syria ] " . The anti @-@ Iraq propaganda reached new heights within Syria at the same time that Assad was strengthening his position within the party and state . When Jadid was toppled by Assad during the Corrective Movement in 1970 , it did not signal a change in attitudes , and the first joint communique of the Syrian @-@ dominated National Command and the Syrian Regional Command referred to the Iraqi Ba 'ath as a " rightist clique " . 
 = Trustee Act 2000 = 
 The Trustee Act 2000 ( c 29 ) is an Act of the Parliament of the United Kingdom that regulates the duties of trustees in English trust law . Reform in these areas had been advised as early as 1982 , and finally came about through the Trustee Bill 2000 , based on the Law Commission 's 1999 report " Trustees ' Powers and Duties " , which was introduced to the House of Lords in January 2000 . The bill received the Royal Assent on 23 November 2000 and came into force on 1 February 2001 through the Trustee Act 2000 ( Commencement ) Order 2001 , a Statutory Instrument , with the Act having effect over England and Wales . 
 The Act covers five areas of trust law : the duty of care imposed upon trustees , trustees ' power of investment , the power to appoint nominees and agents , the power to acquire land , and the power to receive remuneration for work done as a trustee . It sets a new duty of care , both objective and standard , massively extends the trustees ' power of investment and limits the trustees ' liability for the actions of agents , also providing for their remuneration for work done in the course of the trust . 
 = = Background = = 
 Lawyers and academics had been pushing for reform of this area of law since at least 1982 , when the Law Commission published a report advising reform of the rules over trustees delegating their powers to other people . Other trusts reform came about through the Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 , but this did not cover most of trusts law . Although there were some other small changes ( such as a 1996 Statutory Instrument that extended the rights of trustees under the Trustee Investments Act 1961 ) little else was done . Further papers were published on similar areas in 1997 and 1999 , and finally the Trustee Bill 2000 was introduced to the House of Lords in January 2000 , implementing the proposals laid out in the Law Commission 's 1999 report " Trustees ' Powers and Duties " . The Act was given the Royal Assent on 23 November 2000 , and most of it came into effect on 1 February 2001 through the Trustee Act 2000 ( Commencement ) Order 2001 . 
 = = Act = = 
 The Act is divided into six parts , forty @-@ three sections and four schedules , and focuses upon five specific areas of law . These are the duty of care imposed upon trustees , trustees ' power of investment , the power to appoint nominees and agents , the power to acquire land , and the power to receive remuneration for work done as a trustee . 
 = = = Duty of care = = = 
 Part I of the Act sets out a general duty of care , which trustees have towards beneficiaries . Section 1 defines this duty , which is that a trustee , 
 This test has both an objective and subjective element . There is an objective baseline of care that every trustee , depending on the size and responsibility of their office , to exercise " such care and skill as is reasonable in the circumstances " . This codifies the common law and reflects company and insolvency law . It indicates that a professional trustee would be held to a higher standard than a family trustee . The subjective element requires a court to exercise greater scrutiny if a trustee had any special skills , which takes the trustee 's ability above the objective baseline . So if a trustee had a special accountancy qualification that trustee would be expected to exercise a greater than normal degree of care over the trust 's accounts . 
 According to Schedule 1 , the duty of care may be excluded by the trust instrument , but if it is not , it must be exercised when , 
 investing trust capital ; 
 acquiring or managing land ; 
 appointing or reviewing agents ; 
 insuring trust properties ; 
 exercising powers to compound liabilities ; 
 dealing with audits and valuations of trust property . 
 Commentators have agreed that this is largely a reiteration of the previous common law rule on the duty of care . In Speight v Gaunt , Lord Blackburn said that " as a general rule a trustee sufficiently discharges his duty if he takes in managing trust affairs all those precautions which an ordinary prudent man of business would take in managing similar affairs of his own " , similar to an objective test . It has been pointed out that the new duty of care creates problems , because it sets a fixed , objective point . It is not known where this point is , however - a professional trustee obviously cannot be held to the standards of a lay trustee , but it has been seen as equally unfair that a lay trustee would be held to the standards of a professional one . This duty , unlike the previous common law duty , at no point requires the trustee to act . The duty of care has been seen to be advantageous to charities compared to the old one , because it allows those charities forced to employ lay trustees to use professional agents to exercise some duties . 
 = = = Investment powers = = = 
 Investment powers and limits on those powers are set out in Part II of the Act . Section 3 ( 1 ) states that " subject to the provisions of this part , a trustee may make any kind of investment that he could make if he was absolutely entitled to the assets of the trust " . This is far looser than the previous provisions , which were contained in the Trustee Investments Act 1961 . The 1961 Act was repeatedly criticised for its " very conservative investment policy for trustees " . The powers of investment trustees were given were restrictive and narrow , and at the same time the trustees were expected to go through expensive and complicated procedures to exercise them . This new power of investment is treated as a default provision - it is overridden if the trust instrument itself restricts the ways trust money can be invested . If the trust instrument was created prior to 3 August 1961 , however , its provisions regarding investments are treated as void . The new provisions apply retrospectively , i.e. to trusts created before the passage of the Act . They do not , however , apply to trusts governed by the Charities Act 1993 , Authorised Unit Trusts or occupational pension schemes . 
 Section 4 of the Act requires trustees to look at the " standard investment criteria " when investing . These criteria are defined in Section 4 ( 3 ) as the need to check the suitability of investments for the trust , and the importance of diversification . Section 4 ( 2 ) requires that , having exercised their power of investment , trustees must regularly refer back to the standard investment criteria to check that they are being fulfilled . This does little more than restate what is given in the Trustee Investments Act 1961 , however , and this provision has been criticised for not defining " suitable " . In Cowan v Scargill [ 1985 ] Ch 270 Megarry VC suggested that trustees have an overriding duty to invest solely in the financial interests of beneficiaries , unless the trust instrument laid down otherwise . So even though the National Union of Mineworkers ' leader , Arthur Scargill , wanted the mineworkers ' pensions to be reinvested in the British Coal industry and keep jobs , the court held that because this would make less money than other investments it would be a breach of trust . Subsequent case law has qualified this controversial principle , such as Harries v The Church Commissioners for England [ 1992 ] 1 WLR 1241 , and it is a point of ongoing debate . It is assumed by academics that , if a trust suffered a loss as a result of a trustee investing in unsuitable areas , the trustee would be liable for breach of trust . 
 Under Section 5 , trustees are required to obtain " proper advice " before investing , unless the circumstances mean that it is inappropriate or unnecessary to do so . " Proper advice " is defined in Section 5 ( 4 ) as " advice of a person who is reasonably believed by the trustee to be qualified to give it by his ability in and practical experience of financial and other matters relating to the proposed investment " . This is an objective test , and as with much of Section 4 , is almost identical to the test laid out in the 1961 Act . The advice must be sought before the exercise of any investment power , and is also required if the trustee wishes to change where and how the trust is invested . 
 = = = Acquisition of land = = = 
 Rules on the acquisition of land are covered in Part III of the Act . Until the passage of the Act , trustees had no right to purchase land with trust money , with two exceptions ; first , if the trust instrument authorised or required the trustee to purchase land and second , Section 6 ( 4 ) of the Trusts of Land and Appointment of Trustees Act 1996 , which allowed trustees to buy land either as an investment or for habitation by the beneficiaries . 
 Under Section 8 of the Act , trustees can purchase land " as an investment , for occupation by the beneficiaries or for any other reason " . Once this land has been purchased they are free to do with it what they could if they were the absolute owner ; they can sell it , lease it or mortgage it . This is a default provision , and can be made irrelevant if the trust instrument contains other rules and requirements . This land may only be bought in Britain ; if trustees wish to purchase land outside Britain , they must either invest in companies which own land or alter the trust instrument to allow it . 
 = = = Agents and delegation = = = 
 Part IV of the act covers the delegation of powers to agents , and the trustees liability for their acts . This is an area that has long been criticised by practitioners and academics , particularly the provisions of the Trustee Act 1925 . The Act allowed the trustees to appoint an agent in good faith , and gave them no liability for the agent 's acts . In Re Vickery it was confirmed that a trustee may escape liability for an agent 's acts if he acted in good faith , which was simply a test of honesty rather than reasonableness . 
 Sections 11 – 20 of the 2000 Act cover the appointment of agents . Section 11 ( 1 ) allows for trustees " [ to ] authorise any person to exercise any or all of their <unk> functions as their agent " , with Section 11 ( 2 ) defining " <unk> functions " as any function other than the powers to distribute or dispose of trust assets , allocating fees or other payments , appointing a trustee or further delegating duties . Section 15 requires that , where an administrative function is delegated , special conditions must be satisfied . Section 15 ( 1 ) makes it mandatory to write and sign a policy agreement , which lays out guidance on how a function should be undertaken . 
 Sections 21 – 23 cover the review of agents and the liability of trustees for agents actions . Section 21 identifies that review and liability occurs when the trustees appoints agents , nominees and custodians under the Act or under similar provisions in the trust instrument . Section 22 provides a duty on trustees who delegate their powers , with the duty consisting of three elements . Firstly , trustees are required to make sure that agent is suitable for the job he is employed to do . Secondly , they are required to consider whether or not to intervene in the appointment if circumstances demand it . Thirdly , trustees are required to intervene after appointment if the circumstances demand it . Section 23 establishes trustees ' liability for the actions of agents ; a trustee is liable for negligence if he violates the general duty of care set out in Section 1 , but not otherwise . 
 = = = Remuneration = = = 
 Part V of the Act , sections 28 to 33 , deals with trustees ' remuneration . Section 28 states the default position is that trustees are entitled to remuneration if it says so in the trust instrument or if a trustee acts in a " professional capacity " . A trust can differ from this default , but the Act confirms the recent developments in the common law from the old default position that trustees were entitled to nothing unless it was explicitly stated that they were . Section 29 goes on to say that non @-@ charitable professional trustees are entitled to " reasonable remuneration " which will be a sum that the court thinks is <unk> to the work done , along the principles of quantum <unk> . This is automatic if the trustee is a corporation , but will require consent of all other trustees if the trustees are natural persons . Section 30 stipulates that rules on charitable trustee remuneration are to be found in a statutory instrument drawn up by the Secretary of State . Trustees will be reimbursed from the trust fund itself , as will be authorised agents , nominees and custodians who are properly appointed by the trustees all so long as the expenses and payable remuneration are incurred while conducting the affairs of the trust .

 " The Girl in the Fireplace " is the fourth episode of series two of the British science fiction television series Doctor Who . It was first broadcast on 6 May 2006 on the British Broadcasting Corporation ( BBC ) , was directed by Euros Lyn and is the only episode in the 2006 series written by Steven Moffat . Sophia Myles guest @-@ starred as the historical figure Madame de Pompadour . The episode is inspired by Audrey Niffenegger 's novel The Time @-@ Traveler 's Wife . 
 In the episode , the Doctor — an alien time @-@ traveller played by David Tennant — and his companion Rose Tyler ( Billie Piper ) and Mickey Smith ( Noel Clarke ) find time windows on a 51st @-@ century spaceship leading to 18th @-@ century France and a group of clockwork androids using them to stalk Madame de Pompadour throughout her life . 
 The programme 's executive producer Russell T Davies , who conceived the idea while researching for Casanova , described the episode as a love story for the Doctor . The episode was filmed in England and Wales . It was well received by most critics , was nominated for a Nebula Award and won the 2007 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation , Short Form . 
 = = Plot = = 
 The TARDIS materialises on a seemingly derelict spaceship drifting in space . The Doctor , Rose , and Mickey explore the ship and are puzzled to find an eighteenth @-@ century French fireplace . When he looks through the fireplace , the Doctor sees a young girl and asks who she is . She replies that her name is Reinette and that she lives in Paris in 1727 . The Doctor deduces that the fireplace is a time window , a device that allows direct access to another time and place . The Doctor steps through the time window and arrives in Reinette 's bedroom only to find that months have passed there . He discovers a ticking humanoid wearing eighteenth century clothing and a jester 's mask hiding under Reinette 's bed . After it threatens him with a saw @-@ like device that slides out of its arm , the Doctor tricks the creature into returning through the time window to the spacecraft , where he and his companions learn that it is actually an intricate clockwork android . The android teleports away , and the Doctor warns Mickey and Rose not to go looking for it . The Doctor returns to Reinette 's bedroom while Mickey and Rose arm themselves and go looking for the android . Returning to Reinette 's bedroom , the Doctor discovers that she is now a young woman . She flirts with the Doctor and they kiss , before she leaves to join her mother . The Doctor then realises that she is Madame de Pompadour , the mistress of King Louis XV . 
 Back on the ship , the Doctor and his companions find several additional time windows and learn that each leads to a different moment in Madame de Pompadour 's life . In one of them , the Doctor sees another clockwork creature menacing her and steps through the window to defend her . The Doctor tells Reinette to give the android orders , and it obeys her . It tells her that it is a repair android and that their spaceship was damaged in an ion storm . The androids did not have the parts necessary to repair the ship and killed the crew to use their organs for parts . The androids need one last part ; Reinette 's brain . Confused , the Doctor creates a telepathic link with Reinette , but is startled to find that she can also see into his mind . The androids capture Rose and Mickey and are about to harvest them for parts when the Doctor rescues them . The Doctor discovers that the androids plan to open a time window to Reinette 's life at the age of 37 , believing that her brain at that age will be compatible with the ship 's systems . The clockwork androids appear at a costume ball and take Reinette and her guests hostage . At one end of the room is an enormous mirror , which is actually a time window . The Doctor and his companions can see through it , but they cannot enter without smashing the window and breaking the connection as the androids locked it after the Doctor 's previous interruptions . 
 The androids threaten to decapitate Reinette , but the Doctor on horseback crashes through the mirror to save her . The androids give up and shut down when the Doctor tells them that they now cannot return to their ship to finish the repairs . Reinette tells the Doctor that she had her fireplace moved to Versailles in the hope that he would return . The Doctor finds that the fireplace is still an operating time window and uses it to return to the spaceship . He tells Reinette to pack a bag and prepare to leave . The Doctor returns to the fireplace seconds later but discovers that seven years have passed in Reinette 's time . King Louis XV finds the Doctor , tells him that Reinette has died and gives him a letter in which Reinette expresses her hopes for the Doctor 's quick return and confesses her love for him . The Doctor returns to the TARDIS and watches the time windows close before leaving the ship . The TARDIS crew muse about the reasons the androids wanted Madame de Pompadour 's brain to complete their repairs , and the Doctor conjectures that the ship 's memory banks were damaged by the ion storm . When the TARDIS <unk> , a portrait can be seen stating the birth and death date of Madame de Pompadour . As the episode ends , the lifeless ship drifts through space ; its name is SS Madame de Pompadour . 
 = = = Continuity = = = 
 While the episode appears to follow immediately from the previous episode " School Reunion " , Moffat says in the DVD audio commentary that when he wrote " Girl in the Fireplace " he had not yet read the end of " School Reunion " , hence the lack of Rose 's continuing animosity shown towards Mickey after he joins the TARDIS crew . After reading the Doctor 's mind , Reinette says " Doctor who ? " , a reference both to the series ' title and to the long @-@ running mystery about the Doctor 's actual name . She also says that it is " more than just a secret " , but does not elaborate further . Moffat said that he added the dialogue because he believes that because the Doctor does not tell even his closest companions his name , there must be a " dreadful secret " about it . Moffat also says that he did not include the word " Torchwood " ( an " arc word " in the second series ) in the script because Davies did not ask him to do so .

 In 2004 , Russell T Davies — Doctor Who 's executive producer — was responsible for Casanova , a serial set in the 18th century . During his research , Davies become fascinated by Madame de Pompadour and wanted to include her in a story which also involved The Turk — a clockwork man who played chess around the same period and which was later revealed to be a hoax . In early 2005 , Moffat — who had written " The Empty Child " and " The Doctor Dances " for the series — was assigned to write the story . Euros Lyn was later assigned to direct it . Sophia Myles stated in an interview on Doctor Who Confidential that she did not have to audition for the role of Madame de Pompadour , she was offered it . 
 In an interview with The Independent , Russell T Davies said the episode is " practically a love story for the Doctor ... It 's very understated , very beautifully done , but it 's nonetheless a Time Lord falling in love and Rose 's reaction to him falling in love with someone else . " Moffat was inspired by Audrey Niffenegger 's novel The Time @-@ Traveler 's Wife , though the episode 's structure is different from that of the novel . During the production , Moffat considered " Madame de Pompadour " , " Every Tick of My Heart " , " Reinette and the Lonely Angel " and " Loose Connection " for the episode 's title . " The Girl in the Fireplace " was planned as the second episode of the 2006 series , however when Davies realised how experimental it had become in Moffat 's hands , he decided to move it to fourth in the running order between " School Reunion " and " Rise Of The Cybermen " . 
 While Moffat was creating the clockwork automata he first decided to hide their faces with wigs , but when producer Phil Collinson told him this would severely limit camera angles , and that it could appear comical , the androids were given carnival masks to wear . Neill Gorton of Millennium Effects designed the androids and they were constructed by Richard Darwen and Gustav <unk> . 
 = = = Filming = = = 
 Filming for the episode took place between 12 and 27 October 2005 . The scenes set in Versailles were filmed elsewhere ; the first scenes filmed in which Reinette 's body is taken away from city were filmed at Culverhouse Cross in Cardiff , Madame de Pompadour 's sitting room and bedroom scenes were filmed at Tredegar House — a 17th @-@ century mansion in Newport , Dyffryn Gardens in the Vale of Glamorgan was used as the set for the palace gardens , and <unk> Hall near Alcester was used for the ballroom scenes . The scenes on the spaceship , which were shot by the second unit , were also filmed in Newport . 
 Two horses were used in the episode ; one was used for the scenes in close quarters on the spaceship , and another for jumps . According to Doctor Who Confidential , the horse was not allowed into the ballroom for the climactic scene . Thus , the elements of the Doctor riding through the mirror , the horse , the mirror breaking and the reactions of the extras in the ballroom had to be filmed separately and then composited together with chroma key . Tennant 's head was superimposed upon that of the stunt rider in post @-@ production . Initially , the programme 's staff considered the use of special effects but realised this would be very expensive and rejected the idea .

 " The Girl in the Fireplace " was first broadcast in the United Kingdom on BBC One on 6 May 2006 . The final rating for the episode was 7 @.@ 90 million , making it the thirteenth most watched programme on British television that week . It received an Appreciation Index of 84 , considered " excellent " . The episode 's script was nominated for the 2006 Nebula Award , and " The Girl in the Fireplace " won the 2007 Hugo Award for Best Dramatic Presentation , Short Form . 
 Writing for IGN , Ahsan Haque praised Tennant and Myles ' acting , the episode 's pacing and the " extremely touching " story . He wrote that " with a little more attention to temporal details , this episode would have been considered as one of the series ' greatest moments " . In particular , Haque wrote that the episode would have worked better had the writers explained more precisely why the Doctor could not use the TARDIS to visit Madame Pompadour before she died . Metro said the clockwork androids were one of the " most memorable villains " while The Guardian 's Daniel Martin said , " The Girl in the Fireplace " is " one of the most acclaimed episodes from the Davies era " . 
 Ross Ruediger from Slant Magazine wrote that the episode " may be the crowning achievement " of Doctor Who 's second series . Ruediger called it an episode " for the new millennium " as he thought it " could never exist under the banner of the old series . " He called it a " thought @-@ provoking piece " , and wrote that episodes like this could not be broadcast every week since it " would be too taxing on the average viewer 's brain " .

 = Hastings Line = 
 The Hastings Line is a secondary railway line in Kent and East Sussex , England , linking Hastings with the main town of Tunbridge Wells , and from there into London via Tonbridge and Sevenoaks . Although primarily carrying passengers , the railway serves a gypsum mine which is a source of freight traffic . Southeastern operates passenger trains on the line . 
 The railway was constructed by the South Eastern Railway in the early 1850s across the difficult terrain of the High Weald . Supervision of the building of the line was lax , enabling contractors to skimp on the lining of the tunnels . These deficiencies showed up after the railway had opened . <unk> led to a restricted loading gauge along the line , requiring the use of dedicated rolling stock . 
 Served by steam locomotives from opening until the late 1950s , passenger services were then taken over by a fleet of diesel @-@ electric multiple units built to the line 's loading gauge . Diesel locomotives handled freight , also built to fit the loading gauge . The diesel @-@ electric multiple units served on the line until 1986 , when the line was electrified and the most severely affected tunnels were reduced from double track to single .

 The South Eastern Railway ( SER ) completed its main line from London to Dover , Kent in 1844 , branching off the rival London , Brighton and South Coast Railway 's ( LBSC ) line at Redhill . Construction of a single line branch from Tunbridge ( modern spelling " Tonbridge " [ Note 2 ] ) to Tunbridge Wells , a fashionable town where a chalybeate spring had been discovered in 1606 , began in July 1844 . At the time , Parliament had not given assent for the railway . The Act of Parliament enabling the construction of the line had its first reading in the House of Commons on 28 April 1845 . The bill completed its passage through the House of Commons and the House of Lords on 28 July , following which Royal Assent was granted on 31 July by Queen Victoria . 
 The engineer in charge of the construction was Peter W. Barlow and the contractors were Messrs. Hoof & Son . In April 1845 the SER decided that the branch would be double track . A 410 @-@ yard @-@ long ( 370 m ) tunnel was required 44 chains ( 890 m ) after leaving Tunbridge . This was named " Somerhill Tunnel " after the nearby mansion . A mile and 54 chains ( 2 @.@ 70 km ) after leaving Somerhill Tunnel , a 270 @-@ yard @-@ long ( 250 m ) viaduct was required . Southborough Viaduct stands 40 feet ( 12 m ) high and has 26 arches . A temporary station was built at Tunbridge Wells as the 823 yd ( 753 m ) Wells Tunnel was still under construction . It was 4 miles 7 chains ( 6 @.@ 58 km ) from Tunbridge . The temporary station subsequently became a goods station . The first train , comprising four locomotives and 26 carriages , arrived at Tunbridge Wells on 19 September . Trains from Tunbridge had to reverse before starting the climb to Somerhill Tunnel , as there was no facing junction at Tunbridge . This situation was to remain until 1857 , when a direct link was built at a cost of £ 5 @,@ 700 . The old link remained in use until c . 1913 . 
 The SER was granted permission to build a line from Ashford in Kent to St Leonards , East Sussex in 1845 . The LBSC reached St Leonards from Lewes the following year . This gave the LBSC a shorter route to Hastings than the SERs route , then still under construction . The SER sought permission to extend their branch from Tunbridge Wells across the High Weald to reach Hastings . Authorisation for the construction of a 25 @-@ mile @-@ 60 @-@ chain ( 41 @.@ 44 km ) line to Hastings was obtained on 18 June 1846 , Parliament deemed the line between Ashford and St Leonards to be of military strategic importance . Therefore , they stipulated that this line was to be completed before any extension was built from Tunbridge Wells . The extension into Tunbridge Wells opened on 25 November 1846 without any public ceremony . In 1847 , the SER unsuccessfully challenged the condition that the line between Ashford and St Leonards be completed first . That line was opened in 1851 , passing through Hastings and making an end @-@ on junction with the LBSC line from Lewes . 
 = = Construction = = 
 The Hastings Line is built over the difficult , forested , and hilly terrain across the High Weald and sandstone Hastings Beds , necessitating the construction of eight tunnels between Tonbridge and the south coast seaside resort of Hastings . The SER was anxious to construct the line as economically as possible , since it was in competition with the LBSC to obtain entry into Hastings and was not in a strong financial position in the mid 1840s . 
 The construction of the line between Tunbridge Wells and Robertsbridge was contracted to Messrs. Hoof & <unk> , subcontracted to Messrs. H. Warden . By March 1851 , the trackbed had been constructed as far as Whatlington , East Sussex , a distance of 19 miles ( 30 @.@ 58 km ) . All tunnels had been completed and a single line of railway had been laid for a distance of 10 miles 40 chains ( 16 @.@ 90 km ) from Tunbridge Wells . When the 15 @-@ mile @-@ 40 @-@ chain ( 24 @.@ 94 km ) section from Tunbridge Wells to Robertsbridge opened on 1 September , a single line of track extended a further 4 miles ( 6 @.@ 44 km ) to Whatlington . On the 6 @-@ mile ( 9 @.@ 66 km ) section between Whatlington and St Leonards , 750 @,@ 000 cubic yards ( 570 @,@ 000 m3 ) out of 827 @,@ 000 cubic yards ( 632 @,@ 000 m3 ) had been excavated . Construction of the line between Tunbridge Wells and Bopeep Junction cost in excess of £ 500 @,@ 000 . 
 = = = Deficiencies in the construction of the tunnels = = = 
 Supervision of the construction was lax , which enabled the contractors to skimp on the lining of the tunnels . This manifested itself in March 1855 when part of the brickwork of Mountfield Tunnel collapsed . An inspection of Grove Hill , Strawberry Hill and Wells tunnels revealed that they too had been constructed with too few layers of bricks . Grove Hill Tunnel had been built with just a single ring of bricks and no filling above the crown of the brickwork . The SER took the contractors to court and were awarded £ 3 @,@ 500 in damages . However , rectifying the situation cost the company £ 4 @,@ 700 . Although the contractors had charged for six rings of bricks , they had only used four . Due to the cost of <unk> the tunnels , this had to be rectified by the addition of a further two rings of brickwork , reducing the width of the tunnels by 18 inches ( 460 mm ) . The result of this was that the loading gauge on the line was restricted , and special rolling stock had to be built , later becoming known as Restriction 0 rolling stock . This problem would affect the line until 1986 . 
 Wadhurst Tunnel collapsed in 1862 and it was discovered by the SER that the same situation existed there too . Rectification cost £ 10 @,@ 231 . By 1877 , only one train was permitted in Bopeep Tunnel at a time . The tunnel was partly widened in 1934 – 35 . In November 1949 , serious defects were discovered in the tunnel . Single @-@ line working was put in place on 19 November , but the tunnel had to be closed completely a week later . The tunnel was partially relined with cast iron segments . It reopened to traffic on 5 June 1950 . Mountfield Tunnel was underpinned in 1938 – 39 , remaining open with single @-@ line working in operation . It partially collapsed on 17 November 1974 , resulting in single @-@ line working until 31 January 1975 . The line was then closed until 17 March whilst the track was singled through the tunnel . 
 = = = Openings = = = 
 The line was opened by the SER in three main stages : From Tunbridge – Tunbridge Wells , Tunbridge Wells – Robertsbridge and Robertsbridge – Bopeep Junction . A temporary station was opened at Tunbridge Wells on 19 September 1845 while Wells Tunnel was completed . The temporary station later became the goods depot . Tunbridge Wells ( later Tunbridge Wells Central ) station opened on 25 November 1846 . The Tunbridge Wells – Robertsbridge section opened on 1 September 1851 , with the Robertsbridge – Battle section opening on 1 January 1852 . The Battle – Bopeep Junction section opened on 1 February 1852 .

 The line climbs steeply out of the Medway Valley at gradients of between 1 in 47 [ Note 3 ] and 1 in 300 to a summit south of Tunbridge Wells , the line undulates as far as Wadhurst at gradients between 1 in 80 and 1 in 155 before descending into the Rother Valley , which it follows as far as Robertsbridge at gradients between 1 in 48 and 1 in 485 . The line then climbs at gradients between 1 in 86 and 1 in 170 before a dip where it crosses the River Brede . This is followed by a climb to Battle with gradients between 1 in 100 and 1 in 227 before the line falls to Hastings at gradients of between 1 in 100 and 1 in 945 . 
 Bopeep Junction is the junction of the Hastings Line with the East Coastway Line . It lies east of Bopeep Tunnel . There is a pub in <unk> called The Bo Peep . The name was a nickname for Customs and Excise men .

 = = = Stations = = = 
 The original stations on the Tunbridge Wells to Hastings section of the line are mostly in the Gothic or Italianate styles . These were designed by William Tress . Frant , Wadhurst , Witherenden , Etchingham and Robertsbridge stations opened on 1 September 1851 . Other station openings are detailed below . Stations are listed under their original names . 
 Tunbridge 
 Tunbridge station had opened in May 1842 . Following the opening of the branch to Tunbridge Wells in 1845 , it was renamed Tunbridge Junction in January 1852 . The original station stood to the east of the road bridge , whereas the current station , opened in 1864 , stands to the west . Trains leaving Tunbridge had to reverse to reach Tunbridge Wells . This arrangement lasted until 1857 , when a new section of line was constructed enabling trains to reach the Hastings Line without reversal . The station is 29 miles 42 chains ( 47 @.@ 52 km ) from Charing Cross via Orpington . 
 Southborough 
 Southborough station opened on 1 March 1893 . It was renamed High Brooms on 21 September 1925 to avoid confusion with Southborough station on the Chatham Main Line , which had already been renamed Bickley . The station is 32 miles 70 chains ( 52 @.@ 91 km ) from Charing Cross . 
 Tunbridge Wells 
 The first station at Tunbridge Wells was temporary and was situated north of Wells Tunnel . It opened on 19 September 1845 and was replaced by the present Tunbridge Wells Station on 25 November 1846 . It subsequently became Tunbridge Wells Goods station , later renamed Tunbridge Wells Central Goods station . The goods station closed in 1980 , with a siding retained for engineers use . The original station was 44 miles 23 chains ( 71 @.@ 27 km ) from London Bridge via Redhill . [ Note 4 ] 
 The building on the up side of the station was built in the Italianate style . A new building by A. H. Blomfield was constructed on the down side in 1911 . The station was renamed Tunbridge Wells Central on 9 July 1923 with the ex @-@ LBSC station being renamed Tunbridge Wells West . Following the closure of the Tunbridge Wells – Eridge railway on 6 July 1985 , the name reverted to Tunbridge Wells . The station is 34 miles 32 chains ( 55 @.@ 36 km ) from Charing Cross . 
 Frant 
 Frant station is 36 miles 53 chains ( 59 @.@ 00 km ) from Charing Cross . The station building is on the down side . 
 Wadhurst 
 Wadhurst station is 39 miles 23 chains ( 63 @.@ 23 km ) from Charing Cross . The station building is in the Italianate style , with a later one @-@ bay extension . The 1893 @-@ built signal box , decommissioned on 20 April 1986 , was purchased by the Kent and East Sussex Railway . 
 Witherenden 
 Witherenden station is 43 miles 66 chains ( 70 @.@ 53 km ) from Charing Cross . It was renamed Ticehurst Road in December 1851 , and Stonegate on 16 June 1947 . 
 Etchingham 
 Etchingham station is 47 miles 34 chains ( 76 @.@ 32 km ) from Charing Cross . The building is on the up side . 
 Robertsbridge 
 Robertsbridge station is 49 miles 37 chains ( 79 @.@ 60 km ) from Charing Cross . On 26 March 1900 , it became a junction with the opening of the Rother Valley Railway to freight . The line opened to passengers on 2 April 1900 , and was renamed the Kent and East Sussex Railway in 1904 . The Kent and East Sussex Railway closed to passengers on 2 January 1954 and to freight on 12 June 1962 , except for a short section serving a mill at Robertsbridge which closed on 1 January 1970 . 
 Mountfield Halt 
 Mountfield Halt opened in 1923 . It closed on 6 October 1969 . The platforms were built of sleepers and were demolished in the early 1970s . The station was 53 miles 37 chains ( 86 @.@ 04 km ) from Charing Cross . 
 Battle 
 Battle station opened on 1 September 1851 . The buildings are in the Gothic style and stand on the up side . The station is 55 miles 46 chains ( 89 @.@ 44 km ) from Charing Cross . 
 Crowhurst 
 A siding had existed at Crowhurst from 1877 . The station opened on 1 June 1902 and was located at the junction for the Bexhill West Branch Line , which also opened the same day . Despite the line 's closure on 14 June 1964 , Crowhurst station remains open . The station is 57 miles 45 chains ( 92 @.@ 64 km ) from Charing Cross . 
 West St Leonards 
 West St Leonards station opened on 1 October 1887 . The buildings are wood framed and covered with weatherboards . The station is 60 miles 59 chains ( 97 @.@ 75 km ) from Charing Cross . 
 St Leonards Warrior Square 
 St Leonards Warrior Square station opened on 13 February 1851 along with a new section of line between Hastings and the LBSCs Hastings & St Leonards station . This gave the LBSC better access to Hastings . It lies between Bopeep Tunnel and Hastings Tunnel . The station is 61 miles 55 chains ( 99 @.@ 28 km ) from Charing Cross . 
 Hastings 
 Hastings station opened on 13 February 1851 along with the SER branch from Ashford . The station was rebuilt and enlarged by the SER in 1880 as it was then inadequate for the increasing seasonal traffic . In 1930 the station was rebuilt by the Southern Railway . This entailed closure of the engine sheds at Hastings , with locomotives being transferred to St Leonards . The original station building , by Tress , was demolished and a new Neo @-@ Georgian station building by J. R. Scott was erected . The rebuilt station was completed on 5 July 1931 . The station was rebuilt in 2003 by Railtrack . The 1931 @-@ built building was demolished and a new structure erected in its place . The station is 62 miles 33 chains ( 100 @.@ 44 km ) from Charing Cross via Orpington .

 In the late 1860s , a single track link was built between the SERs Tunbridge Wells station and the LBSCs Tunbridge Wells station , which had opened in 1866 . It was 1875 before powers were granted to run a passenger service over this section of line . The junction with the main line was Grove Junction . It was removed on 7 July 1985 , following closure of the Tunbridge Wells Central – Eridge line the previous day . 
 In 1900 , the Rother Valley Railway opened from Robertsbridge to Tenterden . It was extended in stages to Tenterden Town and Headcorn , which was reached in 1905 . The line closed to passengers on 2 January 1954 and freight on 12 June 1961 , except for access to Hodson 's Mill closed in 1970 . The Rother Valley Railway heritage railway are rebuilding the line between Robertsbridge and Junction Road , with completion scheduled by 2018 . In 1902 , a branch line was built to Bexhill West , with a new station at the junction with the main line at Crowhurst . This line closed on 14 June 1964 .

 In 1903 , a railway was authorised to be built from Robertsbridge to Pevensey , East Sussex . The line was authorised under the Light Railways Act 1896 , but was not constructed . 
 = = = = Proposed = = = = 
 In 1856 , it was proposed to build a 6 @-@ mile ( 9 @.@ 66 km ) long branch from Witherenden to Mayfield , East Sussex . [ Note 5 ] In 1882 , an 18 @-@ mile @-@ 40 @-@ chain ( 29 @.@ 77 km ) long railway was proposed from Ticehurst Road to Langney , East Sussex , giving access to Eastbourne . Stations were proposed at Burwash , Dallington , Bodle Street Green , Boreham Street , Pevensey and Langney . 
 = = = Planned electrification = = = 
 Electrification of the Hastings Line was first considered by the SER as early as 1903 . Lack of finance meant that no decision had been made by the time World War I broke out in 1914 . It was stated in 1921 that electrification was a long term aim . In the mid @-@ 1930s , the Southern Railway , which had been formed from the SER , LBSC , London and South Western Railway ( LSWR ) and London , Chatham and Dover Railway ( LCDR ) in 1923 under the Railways Act 1921 , electrified a number of lines . The East Coastway Line was electrified in 1935 , with a depot being built at Ore , East Sussex . In 1937 , it was proposed to electrify the line between Sevenoaks and St Leonards Warrior Square at a cost of £ 1 @,@ 500 @,@ 000 . The scheme was deferred , with another proposal in 1937 costing £ 1 @,@ 300 @,@ 000 also failing to gain favour before World War II broke out . One of the main reasons that electrification was not given the go @-@ ahead was the fact that non @-@ standard rolling stock would be required . The Southern Railway had provided the line with 104 new carriages and six Pullman Cars between 1929 and 1934 . Two electric locomotives were ordered in 1937 . They were built to the Hastings Line loading gauge . 
 In October 1946 , the Southern Railway announced a programme to electrify all lines in Kent and East Sussex in three stages . The Hastings Line between Tonbridge and Bopeep Junction was to be part of the third stage . Track would have been slewed within the affected tunnels with only one train normally allowed in the tunnel . In an emergency , two trains would be allowed in the tunnel at the same time , but restricted to 25 miles per hour ( 40 km / h ) . Standard 9 feet 0 inches ( 2 @.@ 74 m ) wide stock would be used . Following the nationalisation of railways in the United Kingdom under the Transport Act 1947 , the Southern Region of British Railways shelved new electrification schemes , concentrating on the construction of new steam locomotives . In 1952 , the possibility of operating standard rolling stock on the line had been examined . The Operating Department objected to the use of single line sections through the various tunnels . The 1930s stock was refurbished with the aim of extending its service by a further ten years . The first two phases of the Southern Railways ' electrification scheme were revived in 1955 . This did not include the Hastings Line and it was announced in 1956 that a fleet of diesel @-@ electric trains would be constructed to operate the service until the line was electrified . At that time , the rolling stock built in the 1930s was overdue for replacement . The modernisation to the Hastings Line and the introduction of the diesel @-@ electric trains cost £ 797 @,@ 000 , of which £ 595 @,@ 000 was the cost of the first seven trains . A further thirteen trains cost £ 1 @,@ 178 @,@ 840 . 
 Electrification was finally carried out in the 1980s , as detailed below . 
 = = Operators = = 
 From 1845 , the line was operated by the SER . In 1899 , the SER and LCDR entered into a joint working partnership , the South Eastern and Chatham Railway ( SECR ) . On 1 January 1923 , the Railways Act 1921 came into force , resulting in the Grouping . The SECR became part of the Southern Railway ( SR ) . On 1 January 1948 , the Transport Act 1947 came into force , and the SR became part of British Railways , with the former SR lines becoming the Southern Region . British Railways was rebranded British Rail on 1 January 1965 . On 10 June 1986 , Network <unk> branded trains began operating . On 1 January 1994 , the Railways Act 1993 came into force , privatising British Rail . Passenger services were taken over by Connex South Eastern on 13 October 1996 . On 27 June 2003 , Connex lost the franchise due to poor financial management . The Strategic Rail Authority took over the running of passenger trains from 9 November 2003 , using their South Eastern Trains train operating company . On 1 April 2006 , Southeastern took over the operation of passenger trains on the route .

 From the opening of the line , passenger stock consisted of 4 @-@ wheel carriages . In 1845 , there were eight passenger trains a day from Tunbridge Wells to London , with half that number on Sundays . On 23 June 1849 , the Royal Train took Queen Victoria and Prince Albert to Tunbridge Wells to visit Queen Adelaide , the Queen Dowager . The train , consisting of the Royal Saloon , two first class carriages and a brake van made the journey from Bricklayers Arms to Tunbridge Wells in 75 minutes . It was driven by James Cudworth , the Locomotive Superintendent of the SER . The return journey took 70 minutes . The Royal Train visited the line again on 18 December 1849 conveying Queen Victoria and Princess Alice from Windsor , Berkshire to Tunbridge Wells on a visit to Princess Louise . The journey via Waterloo took 100 minutes . The train was driven by William <unk> , Resident Engineer of the LSWR , and Edgar <unk> , Superintendent of the LSWR . At Waterloo , driving of the train was taken over by John Shaw , General Manager of the SER and Mr. Cockburn , Superintendent of the SER . The return journey took 105 minutes . 
 With the opening of the extension to Robertsbridge , there were three trains a day , with two on Sundays . These were augmented by an additional train daily when the extension to Bopeep Junction opened . In 1860 , there were seven up trains and six down trains daily ; Hastings to London via Redhill taking two hours . From 1861 , Cudworth 2 @-@ 2 @-@ 2 " Little Mail " class locomotives were introduced . In 1876 , the Sub @-@ Wealden Gypsum Co built a 1 mile ( 1 @.@ 6 km ) long line from a junction south of Mountfield Tunnel to a gypsum mine located in Great Wood , Mountfield . This line was still in operation as of 2007 . Bogie carriages entered service on the line in 1880 . In 1890 , the winter service was eleven trains each way , of which five were fast . [ Note 6 ] An additional two trains daily operated between Tunbridge Wells and Wadhurst . By 1910 , this had increased to twenty trains each way , of which twelve were fast , plus the extra two Wadhurst services . Four trains ran on Sundays . The service was reduced during World War I , but Sunday services had increased to seven by 1922 . 
 By the 1930s the line was worked by L and L1 class 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 0 locomotives . The Schools class 4 @-@ 4 @-@ 0s were introduced in 1930 ; the width of these was 8 feet 4 inches ( 2 @.@ 54 m ) measured across the cab , and 8 feet 6 1 ⁄ 2 inches ( 2 @.@ 604 m ) measured across the cylinders . The service was again reduced during World War II , with fourteen trains daily in 1942 , of which four were fast ; there were seven trains on Sundays . As built , it was envisaged that the West Country and Battle of Britain class locomotives would be able to work the line . Forty @-@ eight locomotives of the West Country and 22 of the Battle of Britain class were built with cabs that were 8 feet 6 inches ( 2 @.@ 59 m ) wide and paired with tenders of the same width . It was subsequently decided not to work these locomotives over the line . Locomotives from these two classes that were rebuilt gained a 9 @-@ foot @-@ 0 @-@ inch @-@ wide ( 2 @.@ 74 m ) cab . Unrebuilt locomotives retained their narrow cab . 
 By 1948 , the service was sixteen trains , of which seven were fast . An additional three trains ran as far as Wadhurst . In 1957 , the service was eighteen trains daily , of which nine were fast . There were nine trains on Sundays . The Schools Class locomotives worked the line until 1957 when steam was withdrawn on the Hastings Line . Diesel @-@ electric multiple units of what became British Rail Class 201 , 202 and 203 ( the " Hastings Diesels " ) took over working the route . 
 Under British Railways , classes D1 , E1 , H , N1 , M7 , Q , Q1 , Std 3 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 2T , Std 4 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 0 Std 4 2 @-@ 6 @-@ 4T and U1 were permitted to work between Tonbridge and Grove junction . Freight trains from Tonbridge West Yard were not permitted to depart until the line was clear as far as Southborough Viaduct . Other classes of locomotive known to have worked over this section of line include C , and E4 . 
 = = = Diesel @-@ electric era ( 1957 – 86 ) = = = 
 Special narrow bodied diesel electric multiple units were introduced in 1957 – 58 to replace steam traction . British Rail Class 201 ( 6S ) , 202 ( 6L ) and 203 ( 6B ) ( the " Hastings Diesels " ) took over working the route . These units were constructed of narrow rolling stock . They were delivered in six @-@ car formations ( the 6Bs including a buffet car ) and two units were often operated in multiple to form twelve @-@ car trains . In latter years some of the units were reduced to five , and later still , to four cars . 
 The 6S units were intended to be introduced into service in June 1957 . On 5 April a fire at Cannon Street signal box disabled all signalling equipment there . As a result , locomotive @-@ hauled trains were banned from the station . A temporary signal box was commissioned on 5 May and the 6S units were introduced on peak services the next day . Two units coupled together formed the 06 : 58 and 07 : 26 Hastings – Cannon Street services in the morning , and the 17 : 18 and 18 : 03 Cannon Street – Hastings services in the evening . From 17 June the 6S and 6L units were working services throughout the day . The 6B units entered service between May and August 1958 . 
 The Hastings Diesels had almost completely replaced steam by June 1958 . With the introduction of the Hastings Diesels , an hourly service was provided . This split at Tunbridge Wells , with the front portion running fast to Crowhurst and the rear portion stopping at all stations . The service ran every two hours on Sundays . The Hastings Diesels also worked services on the Bexhill West Branch Line until closure on 14 June 1964 . On 22 December 1958 , 6L unit 1017 collided with 6B unit 1035 at Tunbridge Wells Central . 
 In 1962 , twelve Class 33 / 2 diesel locomotives , were also built with narrow bodies for the Hastings line . These enabled the last steam workings , overnight newspaper trains , to be withdrawn from the Hastings Line . Nineteen British Rail Class 207 ( 3D ) diesel electric multiple units were built in 1962 . They operated over the Tonbridge – Grove Junction section of the line as part of a Tonbridge – Eastbourne ( later Tonbridge – Eridge ) service . In 1963 , Frant , Stonegate , Wadhurst and Mountfield Halt were proposed to be closed under the Beeching Axe . One special working took place on 3 April 1966 when one of the ex @-@ Great Western Railway diesel railcars , <unk> , was worked between Tonbridge and Robertsbridge as an out of gauge load . The railcar had been purchased by the Kent and East Sussex Railway for £ 415 including delivery to Robertsbridge . After trying to " wriggle out " of the deal , British Rail eventually found a solution . The vehicle was ballasted so that it leant away from the tunnel walls by some 3 inches ( 80 mm ) and was worked to Robertsbridge at a maximum of 20 miles per hour ( 32 km / h ) . From 1977 , there were two trains an hour , one fast and one slow . In May 1980 , the buffet cars were withdrawn from the 6B units , which were recoded as 5L , but retaining the Class 203 designation . The fast trains were withdrawn in January 1981 , with trains now stopping at all stations . 
 = = = Electric era ( since 1986 ) = = = 
 On 28 October 1983 , it was announced that the Hastings Line was to be electrified . Reasons that decided the issue included a commitment by British Rail to eliminate asbestos from all stock in service by 1988 and the increasing cost of maintaining the then ageing Hastings Diesels . The scheme was to cost £ 23 @,@ 925 @,@ 000 . Electrification was finally completed in 1986 , the line was electrified using 750 V DC third rail using standard rolling stock , and the expedient of singling the track through the narrow tunnels . The tunnels either side of Tunbridge Wells Central station were not singled because the fact that the south portal of Wells Tunnel and north portal of Grove Hill Tunnel were at the ends of the platforms meant it was impossible to install pointwork without reducing the length of platform available . A speed restriction was imposed through Wells Tunnel . Parliamentary powers were sought in 1979 to bore a second Grove Hill Tunnel , but there was much opposition from local residents . This , and the high cost , caused the proposal to be abandoned . The track in Grove Hill Tunnel was relaid on a concrete base , allowing alignment to be precisely controlled . 
 The line was declared to conform to the standard C1 loading gauge on 14 March . The first passenger carrying train comprising C1 stock to use the line was a railtour on 15 March hauled by 50 025 Invincible . It was organised by the Southern Electric Group and ran from Paddington to Folkestone Harbour . A preview service of electric trains ran on 27 April 1986 and the full timetabled service commenced on 12 May 1986 . The next day , a wrong @-@ side failure occurred involving three signals between Tonbridge and Hastings . Contractors had made errors in the wiring of the signal heads . With the inauguration of electric services , a half @-@ hourly service was operated , with trains departing from Charing Cross at 15 and 45 minutes past the hour . Those departing at xx : 15 called at Waterloo East , Sevenoaks , Tonbridge , High Brooms , Tunbridge Wells , Wadhurst , Battle , St Leonards Warrior Square and Hastings , taking 84 minutes . Those departing at xx : 45 called at Waterloo East , London Bridge , Orpington , Sevenoaks , <unk> , Tonbridge and then all stations to Hastings , taking 99 minutes . The Royal Train visited the line on 6 May , conveying Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother . It was stabled at Wadhurst whilst she ate lunch . The train was hauled by a Class 73 diesel @-@ electric locomotive . Upon electrification , services were operated by <unk> , <unk> and <unk> electric multiple units . Class 508 electric multiple units also operated services on the line . When these units were withdrawn in the mid @-@ 2000s , they were replaced by Class 375 Electrostar , Class 465 Networker and Class 466 Networker units . 
 Train services on the line are provided by Southeastern , and are mostly operated by Class 375 Electrostar , or occasionally Class 465 / 466 Networker units . The line still sees a freight service to and from British Gypsum 's sidings at Mountfield . 
 = = Accidents and incidents = = 
 A number of accidents have occurred on the Hastings Line , none of which have involved the death of a passenger . 
 On 4 October 1852 , a passenger train was derailed between Ticehurst Road and Etchingham when the formation was flooded and washed away . Both engine crew members were injured . 
 On 21 June 1856 , a passenger train derailed between Tunbridge Wells and Tunbridge Junction , killing the driver and injuring the fireman and a passenger . 
 On 30 September 1866 , the slip portion of a train , which was to be worked forwards to Hastings , failed to stop at Tunbridge due to an error by the slip guard . It crashed into a rake of empty carriages 262 yards ( 240 m ) east of the station . Eleven of the 40 passengers were injured . 
 On 22 February 1892 , a SER locomotive was run into by a LBSC passenger train at Hastings . The passenger train had overrun a danger signal . Both locomotives were damaged . 
 On 29 August 1896 , the locomotive of a Charing Cross to Hastings train was derailed near Etchingham when it collided with a traction engine and threshing machine using an occupation crossing . 
 On 29 April 1912 , SECR F1 class locomotive No. 216 was working an empty stock train when it suffered the failure of the firebox crown near Tunbridge Wells due to a lack of water in the boiler . Both engine crew were severely injured by escaping steam and jumping from the moving locomotive . 
 On 6 January 1930 , the rear carriages of a passenger train from Hastings to London were partially buried by a landslip near Wadhurst tunnel . The train was divided and the front part continued on to Tunbridge Wells , where it arrived 100 minutes late . 
 On 23 December 1958 , 6L unit 1017 collided with 6B unit 1035 at Tunbridge Wells Central . Eighteen people were injured , with three of them admitted to hospital . 
 On 8 November 2010 , a passenger train operated by Class 375 unit 375 711 failed to stop at Stonegate station due to maintenance errors in respect of the train 's sanding apparatus . The train overran the station by 2 miles 36 chains ( 3 @.@ 94 km ) . Following the incident , Southeastern reduced the interval that the sand hoppers were to be refilled from seven days to five days . The company was fined £ 65 @,@ 000 and ordered to pay £ 22 @,@ 589 in costs . 
 On 23 December 2013 , a landslip at Wadhurst was the first in a series of landslips up to February 2014 which led the line between Wadhurst and St. Leonards Warrior Square being closed and reopened three times , with speed restrictions in place following repairs . The train service was replaced by buses during closures . Southeastern was criticised by Hastings and Rye MP Amber Rudd over poor customer service during this period . By 12 March , the section between Wadhurst and Robertsbridge had reopened , with full service being restored on 31 March . 
 = Consolatio ( Cicero ) = 
 Consolatio or " Consolation " is a lost work written by Marcus Tullius Cicero in the year 45 BC . The work had been written to soothe his grief after the death of his daughter , Tullia , which had occurred in February of the same year . Not much is known about the work , although it seems to have been inspired by the Greek philosopher Crantor 's ancient work De <unk> ( " On Grief " ) , and its structure was probably similar to a series of letter correspondences between Servius Sulpicius Rufus and Cicero . 
 Fragments of the work survive , having been quoted by Lactantius , and Jerome makes note of the work in a consolatory letter to Heliodorus of Altino . A popular piece of writing until its loss , the Consolatio is widely accepted as the distinct work that transmitted the earlier <unk> literary tradition to the Romans of the late Republic . In 1583 , Italian scholar Carlo Sigonio claimed to have discovered a non @-@ fragmentary version of the Consolatio , although most scholars now agree that this work was either a fraud or a hoax , with modern stylometric methods seeming to back this up . 
 = = Background = = 
 Marcus Tullius Cicero ( January 3 , 106 BC – December 7 , 43 BC ) was an Ancient Roman philosopher and politician , famous for his oratory skills . He came from a wealthy municipal family of the Roman equestrian order , and is widely considered one of Rome 's greatest orators , and one of the premier prose stylists during the Golden Age of Latin . Tullia <unk> ( August 5 , 79 BC or 78 BC – February 45 BC ) , Cicero 's daughter , died in the winter of 45 BC after giving birth to her second son ; this caused Cicero to go into a period of deep mourning . 
 Cicero decided to stay with his friend Titus Pomponius Atticus for a time , during which he perused Atticus 's library , reading any and all books that dealt with overcoming grief . Unsatisfied with what he found , he relocated to his villa at Astura , where he composed the Consolatio . It was during this time that he also wrote the famed — and now lost — dialogue Hortensius . Cicero later opined that the Consolatio was written in an attempt not only to heal himself emotionally , but also to benefit others who are mourning or experiencing sadness . 
 = = Composition = = 
 A reference to the Consolatio made by the Christian theologian Jerome in a consolation letter to Heliodorus of Altino concerning the death of St. <unk> suggests that the work was heavily based on the Greek philosopher Crantor 's ancient work De <unk> ( " On Grief " ) . Paul MacKendrick argues that the general outline for the Consolatio can be deduced based both on the structure used by Servius Sulpicius Rufus in a consolation letter sent to Cicero following Tullia 's death , as well as the structure of Cicero 's reply . From what little remains of the work , it would appear that the piece was addressed to Cicero himself . A novel part of the Consolatio seems to be Cicero 's idea that Tullia deserves to be deified into a god . Cicero notes that , in order for his plan to work , her assent must both be recognized by the gods , as well as the Roman public . In order to win over the public , he concludes that he will build Tullia a shrine . 
 The only extant pieces of the Consolatio are fragments , of which seven were preserved by the early Christian author Lactantius in his work <unk> <unk> ( The Divine Institutes ) . In the work , Lactantius used the excerpt from the Consolatio both to point out the futility of paganism , as well as to argue that pagans actually accept some tenets of Christianity , without them even realizing it . Lactantius criticized what Cicero wrote , but also applauded Cicero for paralleling — albeit coincidentally — what the Bible says at times . However , the quotes preserved by Lactantius have been criticized due to their lack of context . MacKendrick notes that Lactantius was using partial quotations in order to frame what Cicero wrote so that Lactantius could more easily refute his ideas . Other excerpts from the Consolatio were preserved by Cicero himself , of which two sections were quoted by him in his <unk> <unk> . 
 Another important reference to the work can be found in the aforementioned letter by Jerome addressed to Heliodorus ; Jerome noted that the Consolatio contained references to " men who showed equal fortitude in sorrow and war , and whose <unk> [ Cicero ] has set forth in his book " . 
 = = Legacy = = 
 The work was of major importance , and today the Consolatio is widely accepted as the distinct work that transmitted the earlier <unk> literary tradition to the Romans of the late Republic . The work supposedly survived well into the 15th century ; St. Ambrose <unk> claimed to have discovered a copy of the text at Perugia , Italy in 1432 AD . 
 = = = <unk> = = = 
 In 1583 , Italian scholar Carlo Sigonio claimed to have discovered a non @-@ fragmentary version of the Consolatio . While this news was met with excitement at first , scholars — after reading the work — began to argue that the manuscript was a fraud , with humanist Antonio <unk> being among the most vocal . However , Sigonio continued to defend the work until his death , even mentioning in two different orations his belief in the truthfulness of the text . The scholar Latino Latini , however , later claimed in a letter that Sigonio had admitted to the forgery on his deathbed . By and large , the academic community concluded that the version of the Consolatio discovered was not genuine , and the document later earned the name the Pseudo @-@ Ciceronian Consolatio . 
 Despite the gradual condemnation of the work and the accusation that Sigonio had created it himself , there were some holdouts . Robinson Ellis , in 1893 , argued that the Pseudo @-@ Ciceronian Consolatio , while probably not a genuine work of Cicero 's , was not a forgery by Sigonio . He reasoned that , because St. Ambrose <unk> had claimed to have found a copy of the work so close to its rediscovery by Sigonio in 1583 , it was possible that Sigonio had simply found the <unk> text . He also proposed the idea that , because the Pseudo @-@ Ciceronian Consolatio contained all of the extant fragments from Lactantius 's work , the true Consolatio had been lost and replaced by a " spurious one " in the distant past that was read by Lactantius , Augustine , and Jerome , who mistakenly assumed its veracity ; this false Consolatio was then rediscovered by Sigonio , who unwittingly believed it also to be genuine . Finally , Ellis argued that , because Sigonio was a man of " high character " who had spent much of his life editing the fragments of Cicero , for Sigonio to stoop to forgery would have been completely out of character . 
 In 1999 , Richard Forsyth , David Holmes , and Emily Tse used linguistic techniques to test the veracity of the document . The paper differentiated between two types of Latin : Cicero 's writing and " <unk> " , which is a style of New Latin popular in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries that sought to emulate the style of Cicero . Forsyth , Holmes , and Tse argued that , if the Pseudo @-@ Ciceronian Consolatio were devoid of " <unk> " , that is to say New Latin , it could be accepted as a genuine work of Cicero . Forsyth , Holmes , and Tse collected six Classical Latin authors ( Cicero , Julius Caesar , Cornelius Nepos , Gaius Sallustius Crispus , Lucius Annaeus Seneca , and Publius Cornelius Tacitus ) , and five New Latin authors ( Sigonio , Piero Vettori , Marc @-@ Antoine <unk> , <unk> di <unk> , and <unk> ) and compared them using stylometric methods . The three concluded that the text of the Pseudo @-@ Ciceronian Consolatio is " extremely uncharacteristic of Cicero , and indeed that the text is much more likely to have been written during the Renaissance than in classical times . " Furthermore , the study also provided evidence that the work matched more closely with the style of Sigonio , rather than any of the other New Latin writers , suggesting that he created the document . 
 = Hurricane Erika ( 1997 ) = 
 Hurricane Erika was the strongest and longest @-@ lasting tropical cyclone in the 1997 Atlantic hurricane season . It developed from a tropical wave on September 3 and moved west @-@ northwestward across the tropical Atlantic Ocean , steadily intensifying until it attained hurricane status on September 4 , becoming the fifth named storm and third hurricane of the season . Erika passed a short distance to the north of the Lesser Antilles , and later turned to the north in response to an approaching trough . The hurricane quickly strengthened to become the only major hurricane of the season , reaching maximum sustained winds of 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) on September 8 ; after maintaining its peak strength for 24 hours , Erika began to weaken as it passed over cooler waters . It turned to the east , weakened to a tropical storm , and became extratropical after passing near the Azores archipelago . 
 The hurricane produced light rainfall and winds throughout the northern Lesser Antilles . The passage of Erika carried a cloud of volcanic ash to Antigua from the eruption of the Soufrière Hills Volcano on Montserrat , a rare occurrence . Strong waves from the hurricane produced beach erosion and coastal flooding in northern Puerto Rico , and caused the death of two surfers . Moderate wind gusts in the northern Leeward Islands and Puerto Rico left thousands of residents without power , and resulted in $ 10 million ( 1997 USD , $ 12 @.@ 6 million 2006 USD ) in damage in the U.S. Caribbean territories . Erika also produced gusty winds and light rain in the Azores . Erika was the only tropical cyclone in the Atlantic Ocean in the months of August and September , the first occurrence of such event in an Atlantic hurricane season since 1929 . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 A large tropical wave , which eventually became Erika , moved off the coast of Africa on August 31 . Shortly after leaving the coast , it displayed a large low @-@ level circulation , though as it tracked westward , the circulation failed to contract significantly . It slowly organized , and by September 3 the convection within the circulation had sufficiently organized for the system to be classified as Tropical Depression Six , while located about 1150 miles ( 1850 km ) east of the southernmost Lesser Antilles . The depression moved west @-@ northwestward at approximately 20 mph ( 32 km / h ) under the influence of a well @-@ established subtropical ridge , and late on September 3 the system intensified into a tropical storm . At that time , the National Hurricane Center in Miami gave the storm the name of Erika . 
 Erika continued to the west @-@ northwest , and in the early hours of September 4 , an eye @-@ like feature appeared to have developed in the center of the deep convection . The feature was not an eye , though , as visible satellite imagery revealed a center partially exposed from the convection . Despite unfavorable wind shear , Erika strengthened further and intensified into a hurricane late on September 4 , while located 530 miles ( 850 km ) east @-@ southeast of Guadeloupe . Deep convection re @-@ developed near the center , and the hurricane slowly strengthened as it continued west @-@ northwestward . Hurricane Erika decelerated its forward motion as it approached the Lesser Antilles , and passed within 85 miles ( 135 km ) of the islands as a Category 1 hurricane . An approaching trough weakened the subtropical ridge , resulting in Erika turning to the north and later to the northeast . On September 7 , Erika began to quickly intensify , and the hurricane reached its peak strength of 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) on September 8 , while located about 350 miles ( 565 km ) north of the Lesser Antilles . Erika maintained peak intensity for about 24 hours before weakening over cooler waters . 
 After passing about 350 miles ( 565 km ) east of Bermuda on September 10 , Erika turned to the east @-@ northeast in response to westerly steering currents . Increased upper @-@ level wind shear weakened the hurricane to a tropical storm on September 12 . Erika continued to weaken as it turned to the east @-@ southeast , though it maintained deep convection near the center despite unfavorable atmospheric conditions . On September 14 the storm turned to the northeast again , and re @-@ strengthened to reach winds of 70 mph ( 110 km / h ) while located 510 miles ( 820 km ) west @-@ southwest of the Azores . On September 15 Erika passed near the western Azores islands , and quickly weakened as deep convection diminished . Erika became an extratropical cyclone on September 16 north of the Azores , and after executing a clockwise loop , the extratropical storm dissipated on September 19 about 230 miles ( 370 km ) southwest of Ireland .

 Early in the storm 's development , forecasting Erika 's motion was difficult , with a persistent leftward bias in official forecasts . In response to Erika 's threat , the government of Saint Martin first issued a tropical storm warning late on September 4 . The next day , the respective governments of Antigua , Montserrat , Barbuda , Saint Kitts and Nevis , Anguilla , Dominica , Guadeloupe , and Saint Barthélemy issued tropical storm warnings for their islands . When Erika 's motion resulted in a path that would take it closer to the islands , all of the aforementioned islands excluding Guadeloupe upgraded the tropical storm warning to a hurricane warning . In addition , a hurricane watch was issued for the British and United States Virgin Islands , as well as Puerto Rico . In public advisories , the National Hurricane Center stated tropical storm conditions were likely to be experienced in the Azores . Early forecasts anticipated a threat to the island of Bermuda . 
 The governments of the islands in the predicted path of Erika urged residents to quickly prepare for the hurricane through radio addresses . In the wake of busy seasons in 1995 and 1996 , which some islands were still recovering from , emergency preparations began . In Puerto Rico , fishermen secured their boats in preparation for the storm . Also on the island , citizens formed long lines at gas stations and purchased emergency supplies . Officials in Anguilla enacted a plan that would turn off the island 's power supply if the winds exceeded 50 mph ( 80 km / h ) . As a precaution , authorities on Saint Martin enacted a curfew for all but those in service jobs .

 Hurricane Erika produced strong waves and high low @-@ level winds throughout the Lesser Antilles . Just weeks after the eruption of the Soufrière Hills Volcano on Montserrat , the storm blew a cloud of falling ash over Antigua . Tropical storm @-@ force winds affected several of the islands in the Lesser Antilles . 
 Winds from Hurricane Erika peaked at 37 mph ( 60 km / h ) with a gust of 47 mph ( 76 km / h ) in the Cyril E. King Airport on Saint Thomas . The outer rainbands produced light to moderate rainfall in the Virgin Islands , peaking at 3 @.@ 28 inches ( 83 mm ) at the University of the Virgin Islands in Saint Thomas and 1 @.@ 32 inches ( 36 mm ) in Saint John . The precipitation produced localized street flooding , while the combination of winds and rain caused power interruptions . Offshore , strong waves capsized one dinghy and broke a 50 @-@ foot ( 15 m ) boat from its moorings . On Saint Croix , the hurricane produced sustained winds of 25 mph ( 40 km / h ) and a peak wind gust of 29 mph ( 46 km / h ) at the Henry E. <unk> Airport . Rainfall on the island was light , peaking at 0 @.@ 83 inches ( 21 mm ) at Christiansted . The wind gusts downed a few power lines , and damage was minor . 
 The outer rainbands of Erika passed over Puerto Rico , producing maximum sustained winds of 23 mph ( 37 km / h ) and a peak wind gust of 42 mph ( 68 km / h ) at the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport . The wind gusts snapped tree branches into power lines , leaving up to 12 @,@ 000 people without power in San Juan , Guaynabo and Bayamón . Rainfall was light on the island , with Caguas reporting a peak total of 0 @.@ 77 inches ( 20 mm ) . The hurricane produced swells of 10 to 12 ft ( 3 to 3 @.@ 7 m ) on the northern coast of Puerto Rico , causing beach erosion or coastal flooding . One road was closed when sections of it were flooded or washed out . The strong waves forced the evacuation of eight families in the northern portion of the island . The strong waves killed two surfers in the northeastern waters of the island . Damage in Puerto Rico and the U.S. Virgin Islands totaled to $ 10 million ( 1997 USD , $ 12 @.@ 6 million 2006 USD ) in a preliminary estimate . 
 Thirty @-@ one ships encountered Erika from September 4 , when it was a tropical storm , to September 18 , when it was extratropical . Two recorded hurricane force winds , with a peak wind report of 99 mph ( 159 km / h ) . The lowest recorded pressure by a ship was 1000 @.@ 4 mbar ( 29 @.@ 542 inHg ) while located 105 miles ( 170 km ) from Erika as an extratropical storm . The lowest recorded pressure while Erika was a tropical cyclone was 1000 @.@ 5 mbar ( 29 @.@ 545 inHg ) while located 190 miles ( 305 km ) from the center . While passing near the Azores , Tropical Storm Erika produced maximum sustained winds of 30 mph ( 48 km / h ) at Lajes Field . Gusts were much stronger , with a report of 87 mph ( 140 km / h ) in Flores . In addition , a 200 ft ( 61 m ) tower on Lajes recorded a gust of 105 mph ( 169 km / h ) . The storm dropped up to 2 @.@ 35 inches ( 60 mm ) of rain in Flores and produced rough seas throughout the archipelago . Damage , if any , is unknown in the Azores . 
 = Culture of the Song dynasty = 
 The Song dynasty ( 960 – 1279 AD ) was a culturally rich and sophisticated age for China . There was blossoming of and advancements in the visual arts , music , literature , and philosophy . Officials of the ruling bureaucracy , who underwent a strict and extensive examination process , reached new heights of education in Chinese society , while general Chinese culture was enhanced by widespread printing , growing literacy , and various arts . 
 Appreciation of art among the gentry class flourished during the Song dynasty , especially in regard to paintings , which is an art practiced by many . Trends in painting styles amongst the gentry notably shifted from the Northern ( 960 – 1127 ) to Southern Song ( 1127 – 1279 ) periods , influenced in part by the gradual embrace of the Neo @-@ Confucian political ideology at court . 
 People in urban areas enjoyed theatrical drama on stage , restaurants that catered to a variety of regional cooking , lavish clothing and apparel sold in the markets , while both urban and rural people engaged in seasonal festivities and religious holidays . 
 = = Visual arts = = 
 Chinese painting during the Song dynasty reached a new level of sophistication with further development of landscape painting . The shan shui style painting — " shan " meaning mountain , and " shui " meaning river — became prominent features in Chinese landscape art . The emphasis laid upon landscape painting in the Song period was grounded in Chinese philosophy ; Taoism stressed that humans were but tiny specks amongst vast and greater cosmos , while Neo @-@ Confucianist writers often pursued the discovery of patterns and principles that they believed caused all social and natural phenomena . The making of glazed and translucent porcelain and celadon wares with complex use of enamels was also developed further during the Song period . <unk> celadon wares were particularly popular in the Song period . Black and red lacquerwares of the Song period featured beautifully carved artwork of miniature nature scenes , landscapes , or simple decorative motifs . However , even though intricate bronze @-@ casting , ceramics and lacquerware , jade carving , sculpture , architecture , and the painting of portraits and closely viewed objects like birds on branches were held in high esteem by the Song Chinese , landscape painting was paramount . By the beginning of the Song dynasty a distinctive landscape style had emerged . Artists mastered the formula of creating intricate and realistic scenes placed in the foreground , while the background retained qualities of vast and infinite space . Distant mountain peaks rise out of high clouds and mist , while streaming rivers run from afar into the foreground . 
 There was a significant difference in painting trends between the Northern Song period ( 960 – 1127 ) and Southern Song period ( 1127 – 1279 ) . The paintings of Northern Song officials were influenced by their political ideals of bringing order to the world and tackling the largest issues affecting the whole of their society , hence their paintings often depicted huge , sweeping landscapes . On the other hand , Southern Song officials were more interested in reforming society from the bottom up and on a much smaller scale , a method they believed had a better chance for eventual success . Hence , their paintings often focused on smaller , visually closer , and more intimate scenes , while the background was often depicted as bereft of detail as a realm without substance or concern for the artist or viewer . This change in attitude from one era to the next stemmed largely from the rising influence of Neo @-@ Confucian philosophy . Adherents to Neo @-@ Confucianism focused on reforming society from the bottom up , not the top down , which can be seen in their efforts to promote small private academies during the Southern Song instead of the large state @-@ controlled academies seen in the Northern Song era . 
 Ever since the Southern and Northern Dynasties ( 420 – 589 ) , painting had become an art of high sophistication that was associated with the gentry class as one of their main artistic pastimes , the others being calligraphy and poetry . During the Song dynasty there were avid art collectors that would often meet in groups to discuss their own paintings , as well as rate those of their colleagues and friends . The poet and statesman Su Shi ( 1037 – 1101 ) and his accomplice Mi Fu ( 1051 – 1107 ) often partook in these affairs , borrowing art pieces to study and copy , or if they really admired a piece then an exchange was often proposed . The small round paintings popular in the Southern Song were often collected into albums as poets would write poems along the side to match the theme and mood of the painting . 
 Although they were avid art collectors , some Song scholars did not readily appreciate artworks commissioned by those painters found at shops or common marketplaces , and some of the scholars even criticized artists from renowned schools and academies . Anthony J. Barbieri @-@ Low , a Professor of Early Chinese History at the University of California , Santa Barbara , points out that Song scholars ' appreciation of art created by their peers was not extended to those who made a living simply as professional artists : 
 During the Northern Song ( 960 – 1126 CE ) , a new class of scholar @-@ artists emerged who did not possess the <unk> l <unk> skills of the academy painters nor even the proficiency of common marketplace painters . The literati 's painting was simpler and at times quite unschooled , yet they would criticize these other two groups as mere professionals , since they relied on paid commissions for their livelihood and did not paint merely for enjoyment or self @-@ expression . The scholar @-@ artists considered that painters who concentrated on realistic depictions , who employed a colorful palette , or , worst of all , who accepted monetary payment for their work were no better than butchers or tinkers in the marketplace . They were not to be considered real artists . 
 However , during the Song period , there were many acclaimed court painters and they were highly esteemed by emperors and the royal family . One of the greatest landscape painters given patronage by the Song court was Zhang Zeduan ( 1085 – 1145 ) , who painted the original Along the River During Qingming Festival scroll , one of the most well @-@ known masterpieces of Chinese visual art . Emperor Gaozong of Song ( 1127 – 1162 ) once commissioned an art project of numerous paintings for the Eighteen Songs of a Nomad Flute , based on the woman poet Cai Wenji ( 177 – 250 AD ) of the earlier Han dynasty . The Southern Song dynasty court painters included Zhao <unk> ( <unk> , <unk> @-@ 1264 ) , a member of the Imperial family , known for popularising the Three Friends of Winter . 
 During the Song period Buddhism saw a small revival since its persecution during the Tang dynasty . This could be seen in the continued construction of sculpture artwork at the Dazu Rock Carvings in Sichuan province . Similar in design to the sculptures at Dazu , the Song temple at <unk> in <unk> , Sichuan province features a wealth of Song era Buddhist sculptures , including the Buddha and deities clad in lavish imperial and monastic robes .

 Chinese literature during the Song period contained a range of many different genres and was enriched by the social complexity of the period . Although the earlier Tang dynasty is viewed as the zenith era for Chinese poetry ( particularly the shi style poetry of Du Fu , Li Bai , Bai Juyi ) , there were important poetic developments by famous poets of the Song era , with the flourishing of the ci form being especially being associated with Song poetry . Song developments in poetry included the works of the social critic and pioneer of the " new subjective style " Mei <unk> ( 1002 – 1060 ) , the politically controversial yet renowned master Su Shi ( 1037 – 1101 ) , the eccentric yet brilliant Mi Fu ( 1051 – 1107 ) , the premier Chinese female poet Li Qingzhao ( 1084 – 1151 ) , and many others . Although having roots in the Liang dynasty ( 502 – 557 AD ) , and further development during the brief existence of the Southern Tang immediate preceding the Song , the ci form of Chinese poetry found its greatest acceptance and popularity during the Song dynasty , and was used by most Song poets . The high court Chancellor Fan Zhongyan ( 989 – 1052 ) , ardent Neo @-@ Confucian Ouyang Xiu ( 1007 – 1072 ) , the great calligrapher Huang <unk> ( 1045 – 1105 ) , and the military general Xin <unk> ( 1140 – 1207 ) were especially known for their ci poetry , amongst many others . The great ci poet Li Yu ( who ruled the Southern Tang under the name Li <unk> ) wrote some of his most famous works during his time as a prisoner at the first Song court , following the demise of his former kingdom : Li Yu is an important transitional figure , sometimes considered to be the first major Song poet , and sometimes acclaimed as the last major Tang poet . 
 Historiography in literature remained prominent during the Song , as it had in previous ages and would in successive ages of China . Along with Song Qi , the essayist and historian Ouyang Xiu were responsible for compiling the New Book of Tang by 1060 , covering the history of the Tang dynasty . Chancellor Sima Guang ( 1019 – 1086 ) , the political nemesis of Wang Anshi ( 1021 – 1086 ) , was responsible for heading a team of scholars that compiled the enormous historical work of the Zizhi Tongjian , a universal history completed in 1084 AD with a total of over 3 million written Chinese characters in 294 volumes . It covered the major themes and intricate nuances of Chinese history from 425 BC during the Warring States all the way up to the 10th century and the fall of the Tang . In 1189 it was compiled and condensed into fifty @-@ nine books by Zhu Xi ( 1130 – 1200 ) , while this project was totally complete with the efforts of his disciples around the time of his death in 1200 . 
 There were also very large encyclopedic works written in the Song period , such as the Four Great Books of Song compiled first by Li Fang in the 10th century and fully edited by the time of <unk> <unk> in the 11th century . The largest of these was the 1013 publication of the Prime Tortoise of the Record Bureau , a massive encyclopedia consisting of 9 @.@ 4 million written Chinese characters divided into 1000 volumes . There were are also rhyme dictionaries written during the Song dynasty , such as the <unk> of 1037 . Although Neo @-@ Confucianism became dominant over Buddhism in China during this period , there was still a significant amount of Buddhist literature . For example , there was the collection of Zen Buddhist <unk> in the Blue Cliff Record of 1125 , which was expanded by <unk> <unk> ( 1063 – 1135 ) . ' Travel record literature ' ( ' <unk> <unk> ' ) was also a popular category of literature during the Song period , which was accounts of one 's own travel experiences typically written in narrative or prose styles , and included authors such as Fan <unk> ( 1126 – 1193 ) . A great example of Chinese travel literature in the Song period would be Su Shi 's ( 1037 – 1101 ) Record of Stone Bell Mountain . 
 There were many technical and scientific writings during the Song period . The two most eminent authors of the scientific and technical fields were Shen Kuo ( 1031 – 1095 ) and his contemporary Su Song ( 1020 – 1101 ) . Shen Kuo published his Dream Pool Essays in 1088 AD , an enormous encyclopedic book that covered a wide range of subjects , including literature , art , military strategy , mathematics , astronomy , meteorology , geology , geography , metallurgy , engineering , hydraulics , architecture , zoology , botany , agronomy , medicine , anthropology , archeology , and more . As for Shen Kuo 's equally brilliant peer , Su Song created a celestial atlas of five different star maps , wrote the 1070 AD pharmaceutical treatise of the Ben Cao Tu Jing ( Illustrated Pharmacopoeia ) , which had the related subjects of botany , zoology , metallurgy , and mineralogy , and wrote his famous horological treatise of the Xin Yi Xiang Fa Yao in 1092 AD , which described in full detail his ingenious astronomical clock tower constructed in the capital city of Kaifeng . Although these two figures were perhaps the greatest technical authors in their field during the time , there were many others . For producing textiles , Qin Guan 's book of 1090 AD , the Can Shu ( Book of Sericulture ) , included description of a silk @-@ reeling machine that incorporated the earliest known use of the mechanical belt drive in order to function . In the literary field of agronomy , there was the Jiu Huang Huo Min Shu ( The Rescue of the People ; a Treatise on Famine Prevention and Relief ) edited by Dong Wei in the 12th century , the Cha Lu ( Record of Tea ) written by Cai Xiang in 1060 AD , the Zhu Zi Cang Fa ( Master Zhu on Managing Communal Granaries ) written by Zhu Xi in 1182 AD , and many others . There were also great authors of written works pertaining to geography and cartography during the Song , such as Yue Shi ( his book in 983 ) , Wang Zhu ( in 1051 ) , Li <unk> ( in 1080 ) , Chen <unk> ( in 1111 ) , Ouyang Wen ( in 1117 ) , and Zhu Mu ( in 1240 ) . Although an early form of the local geographic gazetteer existed in China since the 1st century , the matured form known as " treatise on a place " , or fangzhi , replaced the old " map guide " , or tujing , under the Song . The major differences between the two were that fangzhi were products of local initiative and decision @-@ making , were typically ten to fifty chapters in length , and were almost always printed for a large audience , whereas tujing were products of infrequent demands from the central government and were typically only four chapters long . The widespread availability of printing in the Song allowed many ordinary people to access materials that were once read almost exclusively by experts , such as printed texts and handbooks on agriculture , childbirth , pharmacy and medicine , domestic economics , geography , divination , and Taoist rituals . 
 = = Performing arts = = 
 Theatre and drama in China trace their roots back to the academy of music known as the Pear Garden , founded in the early 8th century during the Tang dynasty . However , historian Stephen H. West asserts that the Northern Song era capital Kaifeng was the first real center where the performing arts became " an industry , a conglomerate involving theatre , gambling , prostitution , and food . " The rise in consumption by merchants and scholar @-@ officials , he states , " accelerated the growth of both the performance and the food industries , " asserting a direct link between the two due to their close proximity within the cities . Of the fifty some theatres located in the ' pleasure districts ' of Kaifeng , four of these theatres were large enough to entertain audiences of several thousand each , drawing huge crowds which nearby businesses thrived upon . The chief crowd that gathered was composed of those from the merchant class , while government officials only went to restaurants and attended theatre performances during holidays . 
 From Kaifeng , the <unk> dramatic style employed the <unk> style of poetic lyrics . After the capital had shifted to Hangzhou , the dramatic style of <unk> ( also <unk> or <unk> ) developed separately . These two different regional genres of musical drama used different regional dialects of speech , recitation , and dialogue , entailed their own unique sets of role types ( <unk> ) , and employed different types of musical instruments playing different tunes . In Kaifeng drama , one singer was preferred for each play , accompanied by string and percussion instruments . In Hangzhou drama , there was a multitude of singers on stage for each set , while string and wind instruments were preferred . 
 Color and clothing distinguished the rank of theatre actors in the Song . Similar to vendors who wore specific outfits to identify which guild they belonged to , actors ' generic costumes reflected the role type they played on stage , whether it be student , young man , young woman , official , soldier , etc . Actors honed their theatrical skills at drama schools . Musicians also found work in the theatre industry , since plays performed in the markets were often accompanied by music . Actors on stage always spoke their lines in Classical Chinese ; vernacular Chinese that imitated the common spoken language was not introduced into theatrical performances until the Yuan dynasty . Although trained to speak in the erudite Classical language , acting troupes commonly drew their membership from one of the lowest classes in society : prostitutes . Themes enjoyed in stage skits varied from satires about corrupt officials to comedy acts with titles like " Setting fire when delivering the soup , " " Raising a ruckus in the <unk> , " " The peony smells best when the wine is stolen , " and " Catching a monkey in a restaurant . " The only <unk> play to have survived from the Southern Song era is the Zhang Xie <unk> yuan ( <unk> ) , featuring interludes such as a clown stealing food and wine at a wedding banquet in act 16 and a quick comedy sketch about renting a room in act 24 . 
 Surprisingly , actors on stage did not have a wholesale monopoly on theatrical entertainment , as even vendors and peddlers in the street , singing lewd songs and beating on whatever they could find to compensate for percussion instruments , could draw crowds . This practice was so widespread that West claims " the city itself was turned into a stage and the citizens into the essential audience . " Many of the songs played for stage performances were tunes that originated from vendors ' and peddlers ' songs . Contests were held on New Year 's Day to determine which vendor or peddler had the best chants and songs while selling wares ; the winners were brought before the imperial court to perform . The Wulin <unk> of the Southern Song states that these vendors , when presented to the consorts and concubines of the palace , were lavished with heaps of gold and pearls for their wares ; some vendors would " become rich in a single evening . " Theatrical stunts were also performed to gain attention , such as fried @-@ glutinous @-@ rice @-@ ball vendors hanging small red lamps on portable bamboo racks who would twirl them around to the beat of a drum to dazzle crowds . Puppet shows in the streets and wards were also popular . 
 = = Festivities = = 
 In ancient China there were many domestic and public pleasures in the rich urban environment unique to the Song dynasty . For the austere and hardworking peasantry , annual festivals and holidays provided a time of joy and relaxation , and for the poorest it meant a chance to borrow food and alcoholic drink so that everyone could join in the celebration . People would gather around their local sanctuary to observe the festival 's games , theatrical entertainments , juggling , clowning , and other performances . The festivities on New Years were considered the most important of the year by the Chinese , its momentous occasion correlating with the beginning of February on the Western calendar . Preparations for the New Years festival took place over a month 's time , as people busied themselves painting door gods , crafting paper streamers with lucky characters for " welcoming the spring , " making printed images of Zhong Kui , and cooking special kinds of foods such as porridge of red haricot beans . The widely popular Lantern Festival was held every 15th day of 1st lunar month . According to the literatus and official Zhou Mi ( 1232 – 1298 AD ) , during the Xiao @-@ Zong period ( 1163 – 1189 AD ) the best lantern festivals were held at Suzhou and Fuzhou , while Hangzhou was also known for the its great variety of colorful paper lanterns , in all shapes and sizes . Meng <unk> ( active 1126 – 1147 ) recalled in Dongjing Meng Hua Lu ( Dreams of Splendor of the Eastern Capital ) how the earlier Northern Song capital at Kaifeng would host festivals with tens of thousands of colorful and brightly lit paper lanterns hoisted on long poles up and down the main street , the poles also wrapped in colorful silk with numerous dramatic paper figures flying in the wind like fairies . There were also other venerated holidays , such as the Qingming Festival , as it was supposedly this period of the year that was depicted in the artwork ( mentioned above ) by the artist Zhang Zeduan ( although some would argue the painting actually represented the time of autumn in the year ) . 
 With the advent of the discovery of gunpowder in China , lavish fireworks displays could also be held during festivities . For example , the martial demonstration in 1110 AD to entertain the court of Emperor Huizong , when it was recorded that a large fireworks display was held alongside Chinese dancers in strange costumes moving through clouds of colored smoke in their performance . The common people also purchased firecrackers from city shopkeepers and vendors , made of simple sticks of bamboo filled with a small amount of gunpowder . 
 Although they were discontinued after the devastation of the Anshi Rebellion ( 755 – 763 ) during the Tang dynasty , lavish Chinese carnivals were revived and once again celebrated during the Song dynasty . Chinese carnival celebrations were held nationwide when the emperor felt a great occasion warranted a grand display of his benevolence and generosity , such as renowned military victories , abundant harvests after long droughts or famines , the granting of grand amnesties by the throne , sacrifices to deities , the installation of a crown prince , marriages within the imperial family , etc . 
 = = Clothing and apparel = = 
 There were many types of clothing and different clothing trends in the Song period , yet clothes in China were always modeled after the seasons and as outward symbols of one 's social class . Coal used for heating one 's home was scarce and often expensive , so people often wore clothing with extra silk @-@ floss and fur @-@ lined coats in the winter . The clothing material preferred by the rich was silk , and for special occasions they had silk robes with gold brocade . The clothing material used by the poor was often hempen cloth , but cotton clothes were also used , the latter being most widely available in the south . The types of clothes worn by peasants and commoners were largely uniform in appearance ( with color standard of black and white ) , and so was the case for the upper class and elite . In fact , wealthy and leading members of society followed accepted guidelines and ritual requirements for clothing . In the upper class , each stratified grade in the social hierarchy was distinguished by the color and specific ornamentation of robes , the shape and type of headgear , and even the style of girdle worn . This rigid order was especially so during the beginning of the dynasty . However , the lines of hierarchy slowly began to blur as the color purple , once reserved solely for the attire of third rank officials or higher , began to diffuse amongst all ranks of officials who bore the color indiscriminately . Along with lower grade civil officials in the government protesting the rigid regulations for attire , the wealthy members of the merchant class also contributed to the disintegration of rules for ceremonial attire worn only by certain members of society . Yet there were still visible distinctions between civil officials and the class of rich merchants and business owners ; the officials were distinguished by their long robes reaching to the ground , while merchants often wore a blouse that came down below the waist with trousers . Pants and trousers were introduced to China during the Warring States in the 4th century BC , and were not exclusive to merchants ; every soldier wore trousers as part of his uniform , while trousers were also worn by the common people . Although most men were <unk> , soldiers , military officers , and professional boxing champions preferred side @-@ whiskers and goatee beards , as they were a sign of virility . 
 The attire of Song women was distinguished from men 's clothing by being fastened on the left , not on the right . Women wore long dresses or blouses that came down almost to the knee . They also wore skirts and jackets with short or long sleeves . When strolling about outside and along the road , women of wealthy means chose to wear square purple scarves around their shoulders . Ladies also wore hairpins and combs in their hair , while princesses , imperial concubines , and the wives of officials and wealthy merchants wore head ornaments of gold and silver that were shaped in the form of phoenixes and flowers . 
 People in the Song dynasty never left their homes barefoot , and always had some sort of headgear on . Shops in the city specialized in certain types of hats and headgear , including caps with pointed tails , as well as belts and <unk> . Only Buddhist monks shaved their heads and strolled about with no headgear or hat of any sort to cover their heads . For footwear , people could purchase leather shoes called ' oiled footwear ' , wooden sandals , hempen sandals , and the more expensive satin slippers . 
 = = Food and cuisine = = 
 From the Song period , works such as Dongjing Meng Hua Lu ( Dreams of Splendor of the Eastern Capital ) preserve lists of names for entrées and food dishes in customer menus for restaurants and taverns , as well as for feasts at banquets , festivals and carnivals , and modest dining . Many of the peculiar names for these dishes do not provide clues as to what types of food ingredients were used . However , judging from the listed seasonings they used for these dishes , such as pepper , ginger , soya sauce , oil , salt , and vinegar , Song era cuisine is perhaps not too different from the Chinese cuisine of today . Other additional seasonings and ingredients included walnuts , turnips , crushed Chinese <unk> kernels , <unk> , olives , ginkgo nuts , citrus zest , and sesame oil .
