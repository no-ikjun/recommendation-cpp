 When enzymes bind multiple substrates , such as dihydrofolate reductase ( shown right ) , enzyme kinetics can also show the sequence in which these substrates bind and the sequence in which products are released . An example of enzymes that bind a single substrate and release multiple products are proteases , which cleave one protein substrate into two polypeptide products . Others join two substrates together , such as DNA polymerase linking a nucleotide to DNA . Although these mechanisms are often a complex series of steps , there is typically one rate @-@ determining step that determines the overall kinetics . This rate @-@ determining step may be a chemical reaction or a conformational change of the enzyme or substrates , such as those involved in the release of product ( s ) from the enzyme . 
 Knowledge of the enzyme 's structure is helpful in interpreting kinetic data . For example , the structure can suggest how substrates and products bind during catalysis ; what changes occur during the reaction ; and even the role of particular amino acid residues in the mechanism . Some enzymes change shape significantly during the mechanism ; in such cases , it is helpful to determine the enzyme structure with and without bound substrate analogues that do not undergo the enzymatic reaction . 
 Not all biological catalysts are protein enzymes ; RNA @-@ based catalysts such as ribozymes and ribosomes are essential to many cellular functions , such as RNA splicing and translation . The main difference between ribozymes and enzymes is that RNA catalysts are composed of nucleotides , whereas enzymes are composed of amino acids . <unk> also perform a more limited set of reactions , although their reaction mechanisms and kinetics can be analysed and classified by the same methods . 
 = = General principles = = 
 The reaction catalysed by an enzyme uses exactly the same reactants and produces exactly the same products as the uncatalysed reaction . Like other catalysts , enzymes do not alter the position of equilibrium between substrates and products . However , unlike uncatalysed chemical reactions , enzyme @-@ catalysed reactions display saturation kinetics . For a given enzyme concentration and for relatively low substrate concentrations , the reaction rate increases linearly with substrate concentration ; the enzyme molecules are largely free to catalyse the reaction , and increasing substrate concentration means an increasing rate at which the enzyme and substrate molecules encounter one another . However , at relatively high substrate concentrations , the reaction rate asymptotically approaches the theoretical maximum ; the enzyme active sites are almost all occupied and the reaction rate is determined by the intrinsic turnover rate of the enzyme . The substrate concentration midway between these two limiting cases is denoted by KM . 
 The two most important kinetic properties of an enzyme are how quickly the enzyme becomes saturated with a particular substrate , and the maximum rate it can achieve . Knowing these properties suggests what an enzyme might do in the cell and can show how the enzyme will respond to changes in these conditions . 
 = = Enzyme assays = = 
 Enzyme assays are laboratory procedures that measure the rate of enzyme reactions . Because enzymes are not consumed by the reactions they catalyse , enzyme assays usually follow changes in the concentration of either substrates or products to measure the rate of reaction . There are many methods of measurement . <unk> assays observe change in the absorbance of light between products and reactants ; radiometric assays involve the incorporation or release of radioactivity to measure the amount of product made over time . <unk> assays are most convenient since they allow the rate of the reaction to be measured continuously . Although radiometric assays require the removal and counting of samples ( i.e. , they are discontinuous assays ) they are usually extremely sensitive and can measure very low levels of enzyme activity . An analogous approach is to use mass spectrometry to monitor the incorporation or release of stable isotopes as substrate is converted into product . 
 The most sensitive enzyme assays use lasers focused through a microscope to observe changes in single enzyme molecules as they catalyse their reactions . These measurements either use changes in the fluorescence of cofactors during an enzyme 's reaction mechanism , or of fluorescent dyes added onto specific sites of the protein to report movements that occur during catalysis . These studies are providing a new view of the kinetics and dynamics of single enzymes , as opposed to traditional enzyme kinetics , which observes the average behaviour of populations of millions of enzyme molecules . 
 An example progress curve for an enzyme assay is shown above . The enzyme produces product at an initial rate that is approximately linear for a short period after the start of the reaction . As the reaction proceeds and substrate is consumed , the rate continuously slows ( so long as substrate is not still at saturating levels ) . To measure the initial ( and maximal ) rate , enzyme assays are typically carried out while the reaction has progressed only a few percent towards total completion . The length of the initial rate period depends on the assay conditions and can range from milliseconds to hours . However , equipment for rapidly mixing liquids allows fast kinetic measurements on initial rates of less than one second . These very rapid assays are essential for measuring pre @-@ steady @-@ state kinetics , which are discussed below . 
 Most enzyme kinetics studies concentrate on this initial , approximately linear part of enzyme reactions . However , it is also possible to measure the complete reaction curve and fit this data to a non @-@ linear rate equation . This way of measuring enzyme reactions is called progress @-@ curve analysis . This approach is useful as an alternative to rapid kinetics when the initial rate is too fast to measure accurately . 
 = = Single @-@ substrate reactions = = 
 Enzymes with single @-@ substrate mechanisms include <unk> such as <unk> or <unk> <unk> , intramolecular <unk> such as adenylate cyclase and the hammerhead ribozyme , an RNA <unk> . However , some enzymes that only have a single substrate do not fall into this category of mechanisms . <unk> is an example of this , as the enzyme reacts with a first molecule of hydrogen peroxide substrate , becomes oxidised and is then reduced by a second molecule of substrate . Although a single substrate is involved , the existence of a modified enzyme intermediate means that the mechanism of catalase is actually a ping – pong mechanism , a type of mechanism that is discussed in the Multi @-@ substrate reactions section below . 
 = = = Michaelis – Menten kinetics = = = 
 As enzyme @-@ catalysed reactions are saturable , their rate of catalysis does not show a linear response to increasing substrate . If the initial rate of the reaction is measured over a range of substrate concentrations ( denoted as [ S ] ) , the reaction rate ( v ) increases as [ S ] increases , as shown on the right . However , as [ S ] gets higher , the enzyme becomes saturated with substrate and the rate reaches Vmax , the enzyme 's maximum rate . 
 The Michaelis – Menten kinetic model of a single @-@ substrate reaction is shown on the right . There is an initial bimolecular reaction between the enzyme E and substrate S to form the enzyme – substrate complex ES but the rate of enzymatic reaction increases with the increase of the substrate concentration up to a certain level but then an increase in substrate concentration does not cause any increase in reaction rate as there no more E available for reacting with S and the rate of reaction becomes dependent on ES and the reaction becomes unimolecular reaction . Although the enzymatic mechanism for the unimolecular reaction <formula> can be quite complex , there is typically one rate @-@ determining enzymatic step that allows this reaction to be modelled as a single catalytic step with an apparent unimolecular rate constant kcat . If the reaction path proceeds over one or several intermediates , kcat will be a function of several elementary rate constants , whereas in the simplest case of a single elementary reaction ( e.g. no intermediates ) it will be identical to the elementary unimolecular rate constant k2 . The apparent unimolecular rate constant kcat is also called turnover number and denotes the maximum number of enzymatic reactions catalysed per second . 
 The Michaelis – Menten equation describes how the ( initial ) reaction rate v0 depends on the position of the substrate @-@ binding equilibrium and the rate constant k2 . 
 <formula> ( Michaelis – Menten equation ) 
 with the constants 
 <formula> 
 This Michaelis – Menten equation is the basis for most single @-@ substrate enzyme kinetics . Two crucial assumptions underlie this equation ( apart from the general assumption about the mechanism only involving no intermediate or product inhibition , and there is no <unk> or cooperativity ) . The first assumption is the so @-@ called quasi @-@ steady @-@ state assumption ( or pseudo @-@ steady @-@ state hypothesis ) , namely that the concentration of the substrate @-@ bound enzyme ( and hence also the unbound enzyme ) changes much more slowly than those of the product and substrate and thus the change over time of the complex can be set to zero <formula> . The second assumption is that the total enzyme concentration does not change over time , thus <formula> . A complete derivation can be found here . 
 The Michaelis constant KM is experimentally defined as the concentration at which the rate of the enzyme reaction is half Vmax , which can be verified by substituting [ S ] = Km into the Michaelis – Menten equation and can also be seen graphically . If the rate @-@ determining enzymatic step is slow compared to substrate dissociation ( <formula> ) , the Michaelis constant KM is roughly the dissociation constant KD of the ES complex . 
 If <formula> is small compared to <formula> then the term <formula> and also very little ES complex is formed , thus <formula> . Therefore , the rate of product formation is 
 <formula> 
 Thus the product formation rate depends on the enzyme concentration as well as on the substrate concentration , the equation resembles a bimolecular reaction with a corresponding pseudo @-@ second order rate constant <formula> . This constant is a measure of catalytic efficiency . The most efficient enzymes reach a <formula> in the range of 108 – 1010 M − 1 s − 1 . These enzymes are so efficient they effectively catalyse a reaction each time they encounter a substrate molecule and have thus reached an upper theoretical limit for efficiency ( diffusion limit ) ; and are sometimes referred to as kinetically perfect enzymes . 
 = = = Direct use of the Michaelis – Menten equation for time course kinetic analysis = = = 
 The observed velocities predicted by the Michaelis – Menten equation can be used to directly model the time course disappearance of substrate and the production of product through incorporation of the Michaelis – Menten equation into the equation for first order chemical kinetics . This can only be achieved however if one recognises the problem associated with the use of Euler 's number in the description of first order chemical <unk> i.e. e − k is a split constant that introduces a systematic error into calculations and can be rewritten as a single constant which represents the remaining substrate after each time period . 
 <formula> 
 <formula> 
 <formula> 
 In 1983 Stuart Beal ( and also independently Santiago Schnell and Claudio Mendoza in 1997 ) derived a closed form solution for the time course kinetics analysis of the Michaelis @-@ Menten mechanism . The solution , known as the Schnell @-@ Mendoza equation , has the form : 
 <formula> 
 where W [ ] is the Lambert @-@ W <unk> and where F ( t ) is 
 <formula> 
 This equation is encompassed by the equation below , obtained by <unk> @-@ Santos ( MATCH <unk> . Math . <unk> . Chem . 63 ( 2010 ) 283 ) , which is also valid when the initial substrate concentration is close to that of enzyme , 
 <formula> 
 where W [ ] is again the Lambert @-@ W function . 
 = = = Linear plots of the Michaelis – Menten equation = = = 
 The plot of v versus [ S ] above is not linear ; although initially linear at low [ S ] , it bends over to saturate at high [ S ] . Before the modern era of nonlinear curve @-@ fitting on computers , this nonlinearity could make it difficult to estimate KM and Vmax accurately . Therefore , several researchers developed <unk> of the Michaelis – Menten equation , such as the Lineweaver – Burk plot , the Eadie – Hofstee diagram and the Hanes – Woolf plot . All of these linear representations can be useful for visualising data , but none should be used to determine kinetic parameters , as computer software is readily available that allows for more accurate determination by nonlinear regression methods . 
 The Lineweaver – Burk plot or double reciprocal plot is a common way of illustrating kinetic data . This is produced by taking the reciprocal of both sides of the Michaelis – Menten equation . As shown on the right , this is a linear form of the Michaelis – Menten equation and produces a straight line with the equation y 
 = mx + c with a y @-@ intercept equivalent to 1 / Vmax and an x @-@ intercept of the graph representing − 1 / KM . 
 <formula> 
 Naturally , no experimental values can be taken at negative 1 / [ S ] ; the lower limiting value 1 / [ S ] = 
 0 ( the y @-@ intercept ) corresponds to an infinite substrate concentration , where 1 / v = 1 / Vmax as shown at the right ; thus , the x @-@ intercept is an extrapolation of the experimental data taken at positive concentrations . More generally , the Lineweaver – Burk plot skews the importance of measurements taken at low substrate concentrations and , thus , can yield inaccurate estimates of Vmax and KM . A more accurate linear plotting method is the Eadie @-@ Hofstee plot . In this case , v is plotted against v / [ S ] . In the third common linear representation , the Hanes @-@ Woolf plot , [ S ] / v is plotted against [ S ] . In general , data normalisation can help diminish the amount of experimental work and can increase the reliability of the output , and is suitable for both graphical and numerical analysis . 
 = = = Practical significance of kinetic constants = = = 
 The study of enzyme kinetics is important for two basic reasons . Firstly , it helps explain how enzymes work , and secondly , it helps predict how enzymes behave in living organisms . The kinetic constants defined above , KM and Vmax , are critical to attempts to understand how enzymes work together to control metabolism . 
 Making these predictions is not trivial , even for simple systems . For example , oxaloacetate is formed by malate dehydrogenase within the mitochondrion . <unk> can then be consumed by citrate synthase , <unk> <unk> or aspartate aminotransferase , feeding into the citric acid cycle , gluconeogenesis or aspartic acid biosynthesis , respectively . Being able to predict how much oxaloacetate goes into which pathway requires knowledge of the concentration of oxaloacetate as well as the concentration and kinetics of each of these enzymes . This aim of predicting the behaviour of metabolic pathways reaches its most complex expression in the synthesis of huge amounts of kinetic and gene expression data into mathematical models of entire organisms . Alternatively , one useful simplification of the metabolic modelling problem is to ignore the underlying enzyme kinetics and only rely on information about the reaction network 's stoichiometry , a technique called flux balance analysis . 
 = = = Michaelis – Menten kinetics with intermediate = = = 
 One could also consider the less simple case 
 <formula> 
 where a complex with the enzyme and an intermediate exists and the intermediate is converted into product in a second step . In this case we have a very similar equation 
 <formula> 
 but the constants are different 
 <formula> 
 We see that for the limiting case <formula> , thus when the last step from <formula> is much faster than the previous step , we get again the original equation . Mathematically we have then <formula> and <formula> . 
 = = Multi @-@ substrate reactions = = 
 Multi @-@ substrate reactions follow complex rate equations that describe how the substrates bind and in what sequence . The analysis of these reactions is much simpler if the concentration of substrate A is kept constant and substrate B varied . Under these conditions , the enzyme behaves just like a single @-@ substrate enzyme and a plot of v by [ S ] gives apparent KM and Vmax constants for substrate B. If a set of these measurements is performed at different fixed concentrations of A , these data can be used to work out what the mechanism of the reaction is . For an enzyme that takes two substrates A and B and turns them into two products P and Q , there are two types of mechanism : ternary complex and ping – pong . 
 = = = Ternary @-@ complex mechanisms = = = 
 In these enzymes , both substrates bind to the enzyme at the same time to produce an <unk> ternary complex . The order of binding can either be random ( in a random mechanism ) or substrates have to bind in a particular sequence ( in an ordered mechanism ) . When a set of v by [ S ] curves ( fixed A , varying B ) from an enzyme with a ternary @-@ complex mechanism are plotted in a Lineweaver – Burk plot , the set of lines produced will intersect . 
 Enzymes with ternary @-@ complex mechanisms include glutathione S @-@ transferase , dihydrofolate reductase and DNA polymerase . The following links show short animations of the ternary @-@ complex mechanisms of the enzymes dihydrofolate reductase and DNA polymerase . 
 = = = Ping – pong mechanisms = = = 
 As shown on the right , enzymes with a ping @-@ pong mechanism can exist in two states , E and a chemically modified form of the enzyme E * ; this modified enzyme is known as an intermediate . In such mechanisms , substrate A binds , changes the enzyme to E * by , for example , transferring a chemical group to the active site , and is then released . Only after the first substrate is released can substrate B bind and react with the modified enzyme , regenerating the unmodified E form . When a set of v by [ S ] curves ( fixed A , varying B ) from an enzyme with a ping – pong mechanism are plotted in a Lineweaver – Burk plot , a set of parallel lines will be produced . This is called a secondary plot . 
 Enzymes with ping – pong mechanisms include some oxidoreductases such as thioredoxin peroxidase , transferases such as <unk> <unk> and serine proteases such as trypsin and chymotrypsin . Serine proteases are a very common and diverse family of enzymes , including digestive enzymes ( trypsin , chymotrypsin , and elastase ) , several enzymes of the blood clotting cascade and many others . In these serine proteases , the E * intermediate is an acyl @-@ enzyme species formed by the attack of an active site serine residue on a peptide bond in a protein substrate . A short animation showing the mechanism of chymotrypsin is linked here . 
 = = Non @-@ Michaelis – Menten kinetics = = 
 Some enzymes produce a sigmoid v by [ S ] plot , which often indicates cooperative binding of substrate to the active site . This means that the binding of one substrate molecule affects the binding of subsequent substrate molecules . This behavior is most common in multimeric enzymes with several interacting active sites . Here , the mechanism of cooperation is similar to that of hemoglobin , with binding of substrate to one active site altering the affinity of the other active sites for substrate molecules . Positive cooperativity occurs when binding of the first substrate molecule increases the affinity of the other active sites for substrate . Negative cooperativity occurs when binding of the first substrate decreases the affinity of the enzyme for other substrate molecules . 
 Allosteric enzymes include mammalian <unk> tRNA @-@ synthetase , which shows negative cooperativity , and bacterial aspartate <unk> and phosphofructokinase , which show positive cooperativity . 
 Cooperativity is surprisingly common and can help regulate the responses of enzymes to changes in the concentrations of their substrates . Positive cooperativity makes enzymes much more sensitive to [ S ] and their activities can show large changes over a narrow range of substrate concentration . Conversely , negative cooperativity makes enzymes insensitive to small changes in [ S ] . 
 The Hill equation ( biochemistry ) is often used to describe the degree of cooperativity quantitatively in non @-@ Michaelis – Menten kinetics . The derived Hill coefficient n measures how much the binding of substrate to one active site affects the binding of substrate to the other active sites . A Hill coefficient of < 1 indicates negative cooperativity and a coefficient of > 1 indicates positive cooperativity . 
 = = Pre @-@ steady @-@ state kinetics = = 
 In the first moment after an enzyme is mixed with substrate , no product has been formed and no intermediates exist . The study of the next few milliseconds of the reaction is called Pre @-@ steady @-@ state kinetics also referred to as Burst kinetics . Pre @-@ steady @-@ state kinetics is therefore concerned with the formation and consumption of enzyme – substrate intermediates ( such as ES or E * ) until their steady @-@ state concentrations are reached . 
 This approach was first applied to the hydrolysis reaction catalysed by chymotrypsin . Often , the detection of an intermediate is a vital piece of evidence in investigations of what mechanism an enzyme follows . For example , in the ping – pong mechanisms that are shown above , rapid kinetic measurements can follow the release of product P and measure the formation of the modified enzyme intermediate E * . In the case of chymotrypsin , this intermediate is formed by an attack on the substrate by the nucleophilic serine in the active site and the formation of the acyl @-@ enzyme intermediate . 
 In the figure to the right , the enzyme produces E * rapidly in the first few seconds of the reaction . The rate then slows as steady state is reached . This rapid burst phase of the reaction measures a single turnover of the enzyme . Consequently , the amount of product released in this burst , shown as the intercept on the y @-@ axis of the graph , also gives the amount of functional enzyme which is present in the assay . 
 = = Chemical mechanism = = 
 An important goal of measuring enzyme kinetics is to determine the chemical mechanism of an enzyme reaction , i.e. , the sequence of chemical steps that transform substrate into product . The kinetic approaches discussed above will show at what rates intermediates are formed and inter @-@ converted , but they cannot identify exactly what these intermediates are . 
 Kinetic measurements taken under various solution conditions or on slightly modified enzymes or substrates often shed light on this chemical mechanism , as they reveal the rate @-@ determining step or intermediates in the reaction . For example , the breaking of a covalent bond to a hydrogen atom is a common rate @-@ determining step . Which of the possible hydrogen transfers is rate determining can be shown by measuring the kinetic effects of substituting each hydrogen by deuterium , its stable isotope . The rate will change when the critical hydrogen is replaced , due to a primary kinetic isotope effect , which occurs because bonds to deuterium are harder to break than bonds to hydrogen . It is also possible to measure similar effects with other isotope substitutions , such as 13C / 12C and 18O / 16O , but these effects are more subtle . 
 Isotopes can also be used to reveal the fate of various parts of the substrate molecules in the final products . For example , it is sometimes difficult to discern the origin of an oxygen atom in the final product ; since it may have come from water or from part of the substrate . This may be determined by systematically substituting oxygen 's stable isotope 18O into the various molecules that participate in the reaction and checking for the isotope in the product . The chemical mechanism can also be elucidated by examining the kinetics and isotope effects under different pH conditions , by altering the metal ions or other bound cofactors , by site @-@ directed mutagenesis of conserved amino acid residues , or by studying the behaviour of the enzyme in the presence of analogues of the substrate ( s ) . 
 = = Enzyme inhibition and activation = = 
 Enzyme inhibitors are molecules that reduce or abolish enzyme activity , while enzyme activators are molecules that increase the catalytic rate of enzymes . These interactions can be either reversible ( i.e. , removal of the inhibitor restores enzyme activity ) or irreversible ( i.e. , the inhibitor permanently inactivates the enzyme ) . 
 = = = Reversible inhibitors = = = 
 Traditionally reversible enzyme inhibitors have been classified as competitive , uncompetitive , or non @-@ competitive , according to their effects on Km and Vmax . These different effects result from the inhibitor binding to the enzyme E , to the enzyme – substrate complex ES , or to both , respectively . The division of these classes arises from a problem in their derivation and results in the need to use two different binding constants for one binding event . The binding of an inhibitor and its effect on the enzymatic activity are two distinctly different things , another problem the traditional equations fail to acknowledge . In noncompetitive inhibition the binding of the inhibitor results in 100 % inhibition of the enzyme only , and fails to consider the possibility of anything in between . The common form of the inhibitory term also obscures the relationship between the inhibitor binding to the enzyme and its relationship to any other binding term be it the Michaelis – Menten equation or a dose response curve associated with ligand receptor binding . To demonstrate the relationship the following rearrangement can be made : 
 <formula> 
 Adding zero to the bottom ( [ I ] - [ I ] ) 
 <formula> 
 Dividing by [ I ] + Ki 
 <formula> 
 This notation demonstrates that similar to the Michaelis – Menten equation , where the rate of reaction depends on the percent of the enzyme population interacting with substrate 
 fraction of the enzyme population bound by substrate 
 <formula> 
 fraction of the enzyme population bound by inhibitor 
 <formula> 
 the effect of the inhibitor is a result of the percent of the enzyme population interacting with inhibitor . The only problem with this equation in its present form is that it assumes absolute inhibition of the enzyme with inhibitor binding , when in fact there can be a wide range of effects anywhere from 100 % inhibition of substrate turn over to just > 0 % . To account for this the equation can be easily modified to allow for different degrees of inhibition by including a delta Vmax term . 
 <formula> 
 or 
 <formula> 
 This term can then define the residual enzymatic activity present when the inhibitor is interacting with individual enzymes in the population . However the inclusion of this term has the added value of allowing for the possibility of activation if the secondary Vmax term turns out to be higher than the initial term . To account for the possibly of activation as well the notation can then be rewritten replacing the inhibitor " I " with a modifier term denoted here as " X " . 
 <formula> 
 While this terminology results in a simplified way of dealing with kinetic effects relating to the maximum velocity of the Michaelis – Menten equation , it highlights potential problems with the term used to describe effects relating to the Km . The Km relating to the affinity of the enzyme for the substrate should in most cases relate to potential changes in the binding site of the enzyme which would directly result from enzyme inhibitor interactions . As such a term similar to the one proposed above to modulate Vmax should be appropriate in most situations : 
 <formula> 
 = = = Irreversible inhibitors = = = 
 Enzyme inhibitors can also irreversibly inactivate enzymes , usually by covalently modifying active site residues . These reactions , which may be called suicide substrates , follow exponential decay functions and are usually saturable . Below saturation , they follow first order kinetics with respect to inhibitor . 
 = = Mechanisms of catalysis = = 
 The favoured model for the enzyme – substrate interaction is the induced fit model . This model proposes that the initial interaction between enzyme and substrate is relatively weak , but that these weak interactions rapidly induce conformational changes in the enzyme that strengthen binding . These conformational changes also bring catalytic residues in the active site close to the chemical bonds in the substrate that will be altered in the reaction . Conformational changes can be measured using circular dichroism or dual polarisation interferometry . After binding takes place , one or more mechanisms of catalysis lower the energy of the reaction 's transition state by providing an alternative chemical pathway for the reaction . Mechanisms of catalysis include catalysis by bond strain ; by proximity and orientation ; by active @-@ site proton donors or acceptors ; covalent catalysis and quantum tunnelling . 
 Enzyme kinetics cannot prove which modes of catalysis are used by an enzyme . However , some kinetic data can suggest possibilities to be examined by other techniques . For example , a ping – pong mechanism with burst @-@ phase pre @-@ steady @-@ state kinetics would suggest covalent catalysis might be important in this enzyme 's mechanism . Alternatively , the observation of a strong pH effect on Vmax but not Km might indicate that a residue in the active site needs to be in a particular ionisation state for catalysis to occur . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1902 Victor Henri proposed a quantitative theory of enzyme kinetics , but at the time the experimental significance of the hydrogen ion concentration was not yet recognized . After Peter Lauritz Sørensen had defined the logarithmic pH @-@ scale and introduced the concept of buffering in 1909 the German chemist Leonor Michaelis and his Canadian <unk> Maud Leonora Menten repeated Henri 's experiments and confirmed his equation , which is now generally referred to as Michaelis @-@ Menten kinetics ( sometimes also Henri @-@ Michaelis @-@ Menten kinetics ) . Their work was further developed by G. E. Briggs and J. B. S. Haldane , who derived kinetic equations that are still widely considered today a starting point in modeling enzymatic activity . 
 The major contribution of the Henri @-@ Michaelis @-@ Menten approach was to think of enzyme reactions in two stages . In the first , the substrate binds reversibly to the enzyme , forming the enzyme @-@ substrate complex . This is sometimes called the Michaelis complex . The enzyme then catalyzes the chemical step in the reaction and releases the product . The kinetics of many enzymes is adequately described by the simple Michaelis @-@ Menten model , but all enzymes have internal motions that are not accounted for in the model and can have significant contributions to the overall reaction kinetics . This can be modeled by introducing several Michaelis @-@ Menten pathways that are connected with fluctuating rates , which is a mathematical extension of the basic Michaelis Menten mechanism .

 = Morchella snyderi = 
 Morchella snyderi is a species of fungus in the family Morchellaceae . Described as new to science in 2012 , it occurs in the non @-@ burned montane forests of western North America , including California , Idaho , Montana , Oregon and Washington . It produces fruit bodies up to 14 cm ( 5 @.@ 5 in ) tall with ridged and pitted conical caps , and stipes that become pitted in maturity . The color of the morel is yellow to tan when young , but the cap ridges become brown to black in maturity or when dried . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 Morchella snyderi was described as new to science in 2012 , along with 13 other morels from the United States and Canada . The study , published in the journal Mycologia , resulted from the Morel Data Collection Project , which aimed to help clarify the taxonomy , biology , and distribution of morel species in North America . The specific epithet honors Leon C. Snyder , who described similar morels in Washington state in the 1930s . According to Michael Kuo , who coauthored the species description , the morel should have been named Morchella <unk> , as it was previously described by Snyder in 1938 , from collections made in Washington . However , molecular analysis determined that Snyder 's type collection contained two distinct species , rendering the validity of the taxon dubious . M. snyderi was also previously identified as phylogenetic species Mel @-@ 12 ( i.e. , defined by DNA sequence ) in a 2011 study . 
 Despite the light coloration of young fruit bodies , Morchella snyderi groups in the elata clade ( named after the European black morel M. elata ) along with other " black " morels such as M. angusticeps and M. tomentosa . Morphological characteristics of morels in this clade include pits on the cap that are usually elongated vertically in mature fruit bodies , and often the presence of a sinus ( a space or indentation ) where the cap attaches to the stipe . 
 = = Description = = 
 The fruit bodies are 6 – 14 cm ( 2 @.@ 4 – 5 @.@ 5 in ) high . The conical cap is 3 @.@ 5 – 8 cm ( 1 @.@ 4 – 3 @.@ 1 in ) high and 3 – 5 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 – 2 @.@ 0 in ) wide at the widest point . The cap surface features pits and ridges , formed by the intersection of 16 – 22 primary vertical ridges and frequent shorter , secondary vertical ridges , with occasional sunken , horizontal ridges . The cap is attached to the stipe with a sinus about 2 – 4 mm deep and 2 – 4 mm wide . The ridges are smooth or very finely tomentose ( covered with densely matted filaments ) . They are initially pale yellowish , becoming pale tan , then grayish brown in maturity , eventually darkening to nearly black when dried . They are flattened when young but sometimes become sharpened or eroded in maturity . The pits are somewhat elongated vertically ( particularly when mature ) . They are finely tomentose , yellowish when young , becoming pale tan to pale grayish brown . Fruit bodies are often found in a transitional stage where the upper part of the cap has turned dark while the lower part remains light . 
 The whitish to pale brownish stipe is 3 @.@ 5 – 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 4 – 2 @.@ 8 in ) long by 2 @.@ 5 – 4 cm ( 1 @.@ 0 – 1 @.@ 6 in ) wide and is roughly equal in width throughout its length , or sometimes slightly thicker near the base . Its surface , initially covered with whitish granules , becomes more granulated as the mushroom ages , and typically develops prominent ridges and pits ( i.e. , becomes lacunose ) with maturity . The flesh is whitish , measuring 1 – 2 mm thick in the hollow cap ; it becomes layered and chambered , particularly in the base of the stipe . The sterile inner surface of the cap is whitish and pubescent ( covered with short , soft " hair " ) . 
 The ascospores of M. snyderi are elliptical and smooth , measuring 25 – 37 by 15 – 23 µm . Asci ( spore @-@ bearing cells ) are eight @-@ spored , cylindrical , and measure 225 – 300 by 7 @.@ 5 – 32 @.@ 5 µm . Paraphyses are cylindrical , septate , and measure 100 – 200 by 7 @.@ 5 – 20 µm . Their tips are variably shaped , from rounded to club @-@ shaped , to fuse @-@ shaped . The contents of the paraphyses are hyaline ( translucent ) to faintly brownish in dilute potassium hydroxide ( KOH ) . Hyphae on the sterile cap ridges are septate and measure 75 – 175 by 10 – 20 µm . The terminal cells are variably shaped ( similar to the paraphyses ) , and have hyaline to brownish contents in KOH . 
 North American Morchella are generally considered choice edibles , but the edibility of M. snyderi was not mentioned in its original description . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Morchella snyderi can be distinguished from similar North American morels by differences in ecological and morphological features . M. frustrata resembles young specimens of M. snyderi , but the ridges of the caps of the former species do not darken in maturity , and it has smaller ascospores , measuring 20 – 29 by 14 – 19 µm . Another potential lookalike , M. brunnea , has a browner fruit body color in young specimens , and a stipe that is not lacunose . 
 = = Habitat , distribution , and ecology = = 
 Morchella snyderi is suspected of being both saprobic and mycorrhizal at different stages in its life cycle . Fruit bodies grow singly , scattered , or in groups on the ground under conifers , particularly Douglas fir ( Pseudotsuga menziesii ) , ponderosa pine ( P. ponderosa ) and white fir ( Abies concolor ) .

 = Full Disclosure ( The West Wing ) = 
 " Full Disclosure " is the fifteenth episode of The West Wing 's fifth season , and episode 103 from the start . It originally aired on NBC February 25 , 2004 . Events circle around a potentially inciting magazine interview with former Vice President John Hoynes . Written by Lawrence O 'Donnell , Jr. and directed by Lesli Linka Glatter , the episode contains a guest appearance by James Pickens Jr . " Full Disclosure " is notable for prompting a real @-@ life letter from Senator Hillary Clinton . 
 = = Plot = = 
 Doing another appearance on Taylor Reid 's news show , C.J. gets blind @-@ sided with news about resigned Vice President John Hoynes . A New York Times interview leaked on the internet has him claiming the President and Leo asked him to stay once the sex scandal broke ( which , as seen on Life on Mars , is true ) . C.J. manages to get a copy of the interview , and it becomes clear that he is trying to portray his former boss and the Chief of Staff in a bad light . When it also emerges that he is writing a book ( titled " Full Disclosure " ) , the White House staff suspect he is planning a presidential run , and that his tactics will involve a smear campaign against the current administration , to distance himself and thereby appear in a better light . As a pre @-@ emptive response , they draw up a long and detailed list of Hoynes ' worst policy blunders from his time in office , to use if he should decide to campaign at their expense . 
 C.J. , however , seems more than reasonably distressed by the whole incident . She pays Hoynes a visit to give him a warning , and it becomes clear that she was one of the women with whom the Vice President had an affair . She makes it clear to him that , should he attempt smear tactics against any of these women , she will fight him on it , and he says he had no plans to include information about her in his book . C.J. later sadly relates to Toby how deeply she regretted sleeping with Hoynes . Distressed and in need of comfort , she decides to finally call her college boyfriend Ben , who has been trying to get in touch with her ( and been ignored or shunted aside ) for quite a while . 
 In parallel storylines , Toby has a meeting with union leaders concerned about cheap imports from China – in particular bras . Imposing trade restrictions , however , could be damaging to the US auto industry . Josh has a meeting with the Base Closing Commission . Deciding which military bases to keep and which to shut down is not only politically hazardous , but a job he finds extremely boring . Leaving the room , he comes back to find his intern Ryan in the act of pulling a confidence trick to get a power Congressman 's favor regarding a base in his district , without his approval . He tells Ryan to clean out his desk but the intern seems to think Josh is kidding in order to throw the Congressman off the track of their " secret plan " . When the democratic Mayor of D.C. ( Pickens ) comes out in favour of a pilot school vouchers programme , everybody is surprised , but after taking advice from Charlie about his assistant 's own public school experiences in the city , the president agrees to support the plan . 
 = = Social and cultural references = = 
 Writer Lawrence O 'Donnell , Jr. is a former Washington insider , and the episode carries many references to contemporary political themes . The web site in question , bringing the leak about Hoynes , is the real @-@ life Drudge Report , a political site that made its fame during the Lewinsky scandal . " The West Wing " had on several occasions been in contact with Matt Drudge , the operator of the site , for permission to use its logo on the series , but been turned down . When the site was used without Drudge 's permission , he reportedly reacted with anger . The timing of the episode , however , was fortuitous , in that it coincided with the much @-@ publicised Drudge story about presidential candidate John Kerry 's alleged affair with a journalist . 
 The Democratic Washington mayor coming out in favor for a pilot program of school vouchers , could be based on Mayor Anthony A. Williams , who broke ranks with his party to support a similar scheme by congressional Republicans . 
 Perhaps the most peculiar fact associated with the episode was a letter by Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton and Representative John M. McHugh addressed to show character Josh Lyman , concerning the closing of an upstate New York army base . Josh points out that the deep @-@ snow training base of Fort Drum is relatively useless in a time when most wars take place in desert terrain . Clinton and McHugh wrote a tongue @-@ in @-@ cheek response pointing out flaws in Lyman ’ s reasoning . 
 = Bramall Hall = 
 Bramall Hall is a Tudor manor house in Bramhall , within the Metropolitan Borough of Stockport , Greater Manchester , England . It is a timber @-@ framed building , the oldest parts of which date from the 14th century , with later additions from the 16th and 19th centuries . The house , which functions as a museum , and its 70 acres ( 28 ha ) of landscaped parkland with lakes , woodland , and gardens are open to the public . 
 Dating back to Anglo @-@ Saxon England , the manor of Bramall was first described in the Domesday Book in 1086 , when it was held by the Masseys . From the late 14th century it was owned by the Davenports who built the present house , and remained lords of the manor for about 500 years before selling the estate of nearly 2 @,@ 000 acres in 1877 to the Manchester Freeholders ' Company , a property company formed expressly for the purpose of exploiting the estate 's potential for residential building development . The Hall and a residual park of over 50 acres was sold on by the Freeholders ( though not the lordship of the manor ) to the Nevill family of successful industrialists . In 1925 it was purchased by John Henry Davies , and then , in 1935 , acquired by the local government authority for the area , Hazel Grove and Bramhall Urban District Council . Following local government reorganisation in 1974 , Bramall Hall is now owned by Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council ( SMBC ) , which describes it as " the most prestigious and historically significant building in the Conservation Area " . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Early history = = = 
 The name " Bramall " means " nook of land where broom grows " and is derived from the Old English noun <unk> meaning broom , a type of shrub common in the area , and the Old English noun <unk> , which has several meanings – including nook , secret place and valley – that could refer to Bramall . The manor of Bramall dates from the Anglo @-@ Saxon period , when it was held as two separate estates owned by the Anglo @-@ Saxon freemen Brun and <unk> . The manor was devastated during William the Conqueror 's Harrying of the North . After William subdued the north @-@ west of England , the land was divided among his followers and Bramall was given to Hamon de Massey in around 1070 . 
 The earliest reference to Bramhall was recorded in the Domesday Book as " <unk> " at which time the manor was part of the <unk> Hundred in Cheshire . With Cheadle and Norbury , Bramall was one of three places described in the Domesday Book that today lie within the modern @-@ day Metropolitan Borough of Stockport . Whereas its value was 32 shillings before 1066 , it was worth only 5 shillings by 1086 . 
 In the first part of the 12th century , the manor passed from the second Baron of Dunham Massey to Matthew de Bromale . According to Dean , Matthew 's father is said to have founded the de Bromale family , naming himself after the manor , and he may have been related to or a follower of the de Masseys . He may have also held the manor at some point . The de <unk> held the manor until 1370 when Alice de Bromale married John de Davenport , and the family name was changed . 
 = = = Early Davenports = = = 
 The Davenports were a family of significant landowners in the north @-@ west of England whose antecedents can be traced back to the time of the Norman conquest . Orm de Davenport lived close to what is now Marton , and his name derives from the Norman French <unk> @-@ port meaning " the town on the trickling stream " , referring to his home on the River Dane . In 1160 , the family became responsible for Macclesfield Forest , and in the early 13th century Vivian Davenport became its Grand Sergeant . The family 's coat of arms includes a man 's head with a rope around the neck , which is said to represent the family 's power over life and death during this period . The Davenports acquired land throughout the area , notably at <unk> , Henbury , Woodford and lastly at Bramhall through marriage . 
 The Davenports held the manor for around 500 years , and it is likely that after their accession they built the current house . The first William Davenport was lord of the manor from 1478 to 1528 , and one of the first recorded trustees of Macclesfield Grammar School . It is possible that he was heavily involved in the final battle of the Wars of the Roses at Bosworth and thereby instrumental in gaining the crown for Henry VII , who rewarded him with a pension of 20 marks per year payable for his lifetime . According to Dean , it was during this first William 's tenure that Bramall may have been vandalised by a man named Randle Hassall , who destroyed all or part of nine houses and stole the timber . This gives credence to the theory that Bramall was rebuilt , replacing or partially replacing an older building . 
 The third William Davenport , who succeeded his father of the same name in 1541 , took part in what later became known as The Rough Wooing , a series of attacks against Scotland ordered by Henry VIII . He was knighted in Scotland for his efforts at the burning of Edinburgh in May 1544 . The fifth William Davenport inherited Bramall in 1585 from his father of the same name , and lived there with his wife Dorothy for over 50 years . The first marriage in Bramall 's chapel was recorded in 1599 , between William ( aged 15 ) , eldest son of the fifth William and Dorothy , and Frances Wilbraham ( aged 11 ) . On 22 April 1603 the fifth William Davenport was knighted by James I at Newark ( where the king was staying on his journey from Edinburgh to London ) and later became the High Sheriff of Cheshire and a commissioner of the Hundred of Macclesfield . During the tenure of the fifth William , many alterations were made to the building , including the addition of a room above the Great Hall ( which would later become the Withdrawing Room ) , and a long gallery . The internal decorations were also updated with additions such as wall paintings and portraits . 
 The sixth William succeeded his father in 1639 shortly before the English Civil War broke out . He was a Royalist , though said not to have been a particularly dedicated one . Many of his tenants became Parliamentarian soldiers , and over the next three years he had numerous visits from Parliamentarian soldiers , mostly seeking to acquire goods such as horses and weapons for the war , and using the house for quartering soldiers . Bramall was also host to Royalist soldiers , who confiscated some of the Davenport property for use in the war . William Davenport was at one point charged with delinquency , and ordered to pay a fine of £ 750 ( equivalent to £ 120 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) , and soldiers continued to use Bramall Hall because of its convenience . 
 = = = Later Davenports = = = 
 The sixth William was briefly succeeded by his son Peter , who was followed by his son William . William the seventh 's son was the eighth William Davenport , and an inventory of his property made shortly after his death in 1706 shows the gallery and gatehouse of Bramall were still intact . His two eldest sons each inherited the estate but both died young and heirless , so the estate passed to their younger brother Warren Davenport . Warren became part of the clergy , and during his tenure at Bramall set up a school close to the entrance of the estate . The tenth and final William Davenport succeeded his father , Warren at the age of four . Many changes were made to the house during his tenure , including the dismantling of the gatehouse side of the courtyard and the long gallery , the latter of which may have been done because of their being considered unsafe . William had no sons , so the estate passed to Salusbury Pryce Humphreys , the husband of his illegitimate daughter Maria . 
 Humphreys , a Naval captain , had married Maria Davenport in 1810 , and lived at Bramall Hall long before he succeeded his father @-@ in @-@ law . He became widely respected in the Stockport area , but following his succession to the estate in 1829 , there were disputes from other members of the Davenport family who claimed a right to the property . Edmund Davenport , who claimed ancestry from Thomas Davenport , the third son of Peter , unsuccessfully contested the succession in two different courts ; Edmund was eventually imprisoned for failing to pay the legal fees . Humphreys was knighted in 1834 for his services , and in 1838 changed his name to Davenport , in an effort to continue the Davenport line . He moved with Maria to Cheltenham in 1841 , most likely because living at Bramall had become expensive or because of health concerns . Salusbury died there four years later and was buried in <unk> . 
 Over the next decade the house was likely to have been let , as Maria Davenport preferred to live elsewhere . Her eldest son , William Davenport Davenport married firstly to Camilla Maria Gatt , then secondly to Diana Handley , whom he lived with at Bramall for four years before the estate was passed to him . Maria moved to London where she lived with her youngest son , Charles , and died in 1866 . During William 's tenure Bramall was regularly visited by members of the public , and the Chapel continued to be used for regular services of worship . However , following his death in 1869 , the property was let to Wakefield Christy of <unk> & Co <unk> , therefore ending direct involvement from the Davenport family . This occurred because William 's son , John , was too young to inherit the estate . John 's whereabouts during Christy 's seven @-@ year tenure is unknown , though he was shown as a visitor at Bramall in 1871 , and in 1874 became the first chairman of the Bramhall School Board . In 1876 , shortly before he returned to the house , he was listed as living on Ack Lane in Bramhall . 
 = = = Later history = = = 
 John Davenport returned to Bramall in 1876 at the age of 25 , but on 24 January 1877 it was announced that the estate was to be sold . The furniture was auctioned , while the house itself and rest of the Bramall estate ( totalling 1 @,@ 918 acres ( 7 @.@ 8 km2 ) ) was sold to the Freeholders Company Limited , a Manchester property development firm , on 3 August 1877 for £ 200 @,@ 000 ( about £ 17 million in 2016 ) . According to speculation , the sale was motivated by financial issues and a personal distaste of the building . It remained empty until 1882 when it was purchased by Thomas Nevill , a local industrialist whose wealth came from calico printing , for his son , Charles . While living in the house , Charles Nevill carried out substantial restoration and remodelling , making the interior more comfortable while retaining most of the building 's external features . The landscape of the grounds was redesigned , and a new stable was built along with a west and east lodge , housing the coachman and head gardener respectively . Another building , known as Hall Cottage , was also built in the vicinity , and housed the Sidebottom family . 
 Thomas Nevill , Charles ' nephew and adopted son , inherited the estate in 1916 , but decided to sell it following financial difficulties after the First World War . In 1923 , many items of furniture were auctioned off , but there was no interest in purchase of the house . During that decade rumours arose that Bramall would be dismantled and transported to the United States ; this may have been popularised by the autobiography of Kate Douglas Wiggin which described the author 's visit to Bramall in 1890 . In 1925 , the house was auctioned , with the condition that if no purchaser came forward it would be demolished and the materials sold off . At one point the neighbouring local authority , Stockport County Borough Council , offered to buy the estate , but Nevill rejected their offer as " unacceptable " . The auction received no acceptable offers . However , one of those present , John Henry Davies , president of Manchester United , later offered £ 15 @,@ 000 ( about £ 772 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) for the house ; this was accepted . He lived in the house until his death in 1927 , and his widow Amy remained there until 1935 , when she sold it to Hazel Grove and Bramhall Urban District Council for £ 14 @,@ 360 ( worth about £ 899 @,@ 000 in 2016 ) with the intention that the house and park be open to the public . 
 Under council ownership , the house was occupied by a caretaker , though most of the building was open to the public . The house and grounds were used for various functions , such as the proclamation of George VI succeeding his brother King Edward VIII to the throne . At that time , the house was sparsely furnished as the Council was unable to afford much furniture . One of the Council 's earliest projects was the restoration of the Chapel , which had fallen out of use towards the end of the 19th century . It was restored to resemble how it would have been when the Davenports were last at Bramall , and a service of consecration was held on 30 October 1938 once the work had been completed . In 1947 , an association called the Friends of Bramall Hall was set up , primarily to find furnishings for the house , but also to advertise and assist in the upkeep of the house and grounds . Over the years , many furnishings which had once belonged to the house were returned , including portraits of the occupants . The estate is now the property of Stockport Metropolitan Borough Council ( SMBC ) , which acquired it in 1974 , following local government reorganisation . 
 = = = Present day = = = 
 The house and grounds are open to the public and are run by SMBC . Visitors may take an official tour of the house or wander the grounds freely . Events and club meetings are held in the house and grounds throughout the year , and local schools often visit to experience life in a particular era . The house is licensed for wedding and civil partnership ceremonies , and has been used as a background for television series and films , including Prank Patrol , Cash in the Attic , Coronation Street and The Last Vampyre . 
 Although the house and the park are known by the name " Bramall " , both have been spelled as " Bramhall " , " <unk> " and other variations over the years . The Domesday Book used the spelling " <unk> " , which led Charles Nevill to prefer " Bramall " , a convention maintained by Hazel Grove and Bramhall Urban District Council when it acquired the property and continued by Stockport Council . There remains , however , confusion over spelling , most often with the house being referred to as " Bramhall " , the name of the village in which Bramall Hall is situated . 
 = = House = = 
 There has been a settlement at Bramall since Saxon times . According to Alfred Burton , who wrote about Bramall in the late 19th century , the house has not always been in the present location , and was originally at Crow Holt Wood . This theory was rejected by another historian , Frederick Moorhouse , who became convinced in 1909 that Crow Holt Wood was a place where animals would have been taken to be sorted . There is no conclusive evidence to support either theory . Today the house is situated at the top of two valleys to its south and east sides , which two streams run through . It is a grade I listed building , and the oldest parts date from the late 14th century , with later renovations dating from the 16th and 19th centuries . It was originally accessed from the east side – the drive followed the route of the Ladybrook stream , then uphill towards the Chapel on the south side , reaching the courtyard on the other side . The main entrance is now on the side of the courtyard , in the west , because of the restructuring of the drive in 1888 . The current layout of the house can clearly be seen from the west side of the building , in the courtyard : the service wing is on the left , the Great Hall is in the centre , and the Banqueting Hall is on the right . Before the 19th century , the courtyard was enclosed by a gatehouse which was taken down between 1774 and 1819 , because of its being neither required nor in vogue . 
 The house is built with stone foundations , and the main structure is made of oak timbers , joined together using <unk> and tenon joints , and held in place with oak pegs . Wattle and daub or lath and plaster are used to fill the spaces between the timbers . The black and white appearance from the timber framing construction dates from the Tudor period , though some parts have been repaired in later years .

 The Great Hall is the central part of Bramall Hall . As with typical great halls in the Middle Ages , this would have been the room where the business of the house , estate and its villagers was conducted as well as a communal eating room for the household . It was originally an open @-@ roofed , single @-@ storey building , with a fireplace situated in the middle of the floor . It was probably first built around the end of the 14th century when the Davenports became lords of the manor . Towards the end of the 16th century , the Great Hall was substantially rebuilt , and the Withdrawing Room was created above it . A long gallery was also added as a third storey . The history of the gallery is uncertain ; it was intact in 1790 but was taken down before 1819 , because it was believed to be unsafe . A similar gallery was built at Little Moreton Hall , and it is still intact , causing the lower storeys to buckle under the weight . The Great Hall has a bay window with leaded windows , common throughout the building . William Harrison Ainsworth wrote about a right of way through the Great Hall , in his 1834 novel Rookwood . He described how a traveller could pass through the Great Hall , and be entertained and sometimes refreshed . He described Bramall as " [ the ] best specimen of its class ... its class , in our opinion , is the best ... to be met with in Cheshire " . No evidence exists for any such right of way . According to another tale , food from the buttery hatch was given to the poor who congregated outside . 
 The Lesser Hall leads off the southern end of the Great Hall . Its walls are panelled with oak , and the timbers that the ceiling is constructed of are decorated with cross and rose shapes dating from the Victorian era . The Banqueting Hall , which leads off the Lesser Hall to the west , is believed by Dean to be the oldest part of the house . Its northern wall is possibly the oldest part of the house , not having been renovated like the rest of the courtyard walls . The <unk> used this room as a billiards room . The Chapel , opposite the Banqueting Hall , was the only place of public worship in Bramhall for many years . Its existence was first recorded in 1541 , when it was described in the will of the second William Davenport . It fell into disrepair after its closure between 1869 and 1890 , and was restored by the council following their purchase of the property in 1935 , and religious services began to be held there again . On the north wall are unglazed windows which face the wall of the Library , showing that the south wing was once separate from the Great Hall . The Ten Commandments are written on the west wall . Underneath the Commandments , an older , pre @-@ Reformation Passion painting , is visible . Such depictions were banned during the Reformation , and whitewashed over . It was not until the 20th century that efforts were made to restore Passion paintings , but very little of this particular painting survives . 
 = = = First floor = = = 
 The Ballroom , also known as the Upper Banqueting Hall , has an arched roof and according to Dean likely dates from the 16th century . It contains rare 16th @-@ century wall murals , including one which according to Dean may depict the nursery rhyme " Ride a cock horse " , and another along the east wall depicting a man playing a mandolin . Above the Chapel is the Chapel Room , also known as the Queen Anne Room , the Priest 's Room , and Nevill 's Room . It had been two rooms , a state bedroom and ante @-@ room , but was almost totally transformed in the late 19th century into one larger room . A blocked @-@ up door next to the fireplace was thought to have been a priest hole , but is more likely to have been the entrance to the first floor of the house from an external staircase before the wing was restructured , probably in the late 16th century or the early 17th century . 
 North of the Chapel Room is the Paradise Room , whose name derives from the bed hangings which include embroidered images of Adam and Eve and their fall from paradise , as well as the use in Tudor times of the name " paradise " for a favourite room , often a bedchamber . This room has panelled walls , and a fireplace with a cupboard on the right hand side . On the other side there is a small recess , which was described in an 1882 newspaper as " a dark passage which is said to lead to some region unknown " . It is possible that this was a priest 's hide , adjacent to the Chapel and Chapel Room . Less romantically , it may , alternatively , have been a garderobe or privy . This room became associated with sightings of ghosts in the 19th century , and legends of a secret passage that led from the room outside or to the Chapel arose , though no such passages exist . 
 The largest room on the first floor is the Withdrawing Room , situated above the Great Hall . It has an elaborate plaster ceiling , and the overmantel above the fireplace bears the arms of Queen Elizabeth I. The frieze of the Withdrawing Room incorporates shields of arms representing marriages of the Davenports . 
 The northern wing of Bramall came to be the service wing with the kitchen , scullery , butler 's pantry , dairy and store rooms on the ground floor and the servants ' bedrooms in the attic . 
 = = Grounds = = 
 The house is set in around 70 acres ( 28 ha ) of parkland , only a part of the estate originally attached to the house , which was , at one time , about 2 @,@ 000 acres ( 810 ha ) in extent . The park was used for hunting , and the grounds were home to cattle , deer and horses , until the 17th century , when it was used as agricultural land . Two water courses run through the park : the Ladybrook , which , a little beyond the Park , becomes the Micker Brook , before flowing into the River Mersey , and a stream known as the Carr Brook . In the 1880s , Charles Nevill remodelled the grounds in the Romantic Victorian taste , altering the course of the Ladybrook , adding considerably to the trees in the park and creating artificial ponds The ponds were stocked with trout ( though they are no longer fished ) , . In 1888 , a new drive was made through the park , a few yards further to the south of the house than the previous drive , and below the East Front of the house Nevill set out terraces . 
 The park is open to the public and features woodland , open grass areas , gardens , a café , a bowling green , and children 's play areas . 
 = Edward T. Breathitt = 
 Edward Thompson " Ned " Breathitt , Jr . ( November 26 , 1924 – October 14 , 2003 ) was a politician from the US state of Kentucky . A member of one of the state 's political families , he was the 51st Governor of Kentucky , serving from 1963 to 1967 . After serving in World War II and graduating from the University of Kentucky , Breathitt worked on the presidential campaign of Adlai Stevenson , the senatorial campaign of Alben Barkley , and the gubernatorial campaign of Bert T. Combs . When Combs won the governorship in 1959 , he appointed Breathitt as personnel commissioner , where he wrote legislation establishing the first merit system for state employees . He continued to hold appointive offices throughout Combs ' tenure , and in 1962 , Combs endorsed Breathitt to succeed him as governor . 
 Breathitt defeated two @-@ time former governor A. B. " Happy " Chandler in the Democratic primary , ending Chandler 's political career . He went on to win the general election over Republican Louie B. Nunn . Breathitt continued Combs ' work of improving state highways and parks , improving education funding , and strengthening regulations on strip mining . His major accomplishment as governor was the passage of the Kentucky Civil Rights Act , the first desegregation law passed by a southern state . His biggest disappointment was his inability to win approval of a new state constitution . 
 Following his term as governor , Breathitt worked as legal counsel for Southern Railway , and later became vice @-@ president of public affairs for Norfolk Southern Corporation . He engaged in numerous community service activities and served on political commissions aimed at eliminating poverty . Breathitt collapsed while making a speech at Lexington Community College on October 10 , 2003 . He was admitted to the University of Kentucky Hospital , but remained comatose after the collapse and died four days later . 
 Breathitt 's oral history project is housed at the Louie B. Nunn Center for Oral History at the University of Kentucky Libraries and is also available online . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Ned Breathitt was born in Hopkinsville , Kentucky , on November 26 , 1924 . He was the only child of Edward Thompson and Mary ( Wallace ) Breathitt . Breathitt 's family had a considerable tradition in politics . A distant relative , John Breathitt had been governor of Kentucky in 1832 . James Breathitt , Sr. , Ned Breathitt 's grandfather , had served as state attorney general from 1907 to 1911 , and his uncle , James Breathitt , Jr . , was lieutenant governor from 1927 to 1932 . 
 Breathitt obtained his early education in the public schools of Hopkinsville and graduated from Hopkinsville High School in 1942 . Later that year , he enlisted in the U.S. Army Air Force for service in World War II , serving until 1945 . After the war , he matriculated to the University of Kentucky . While there , he served as president of the Omicron Delta Kappa honor society and the Lamp and Cross society ; he was also a member of the Sigma Alpha Epsilon social fraternity . Seeing Breathitt 's interest in politics , professors Jack Reeves and Thomas D. Clark asked him to chair the campus campaign supporting a new state constitution . Breathitt accepted , and although the proposed constitution failed , he remained committed to seeing the document updated . 
 In 1948 , Breathitt earned a Bachelor of Arts degree in business administration . On December 20 , 1948 , he married Frances Holleman of Mayfield , Kentucky . The couple had four children : Mary Fran , Linda , Susan , and Edward III . In 1950 , Breathitt earned a Bachelor of Laws degree and returned to Hopkinsville where he joined the law firm of Trimble , <unk> , and Breathitt . 
 = = Political career = = 
 In 1951 , Breathitt was elected to the first of three consecutive terms in the Kentucky House of Representatives , representing the Ninth District . As a legislator , he was the acknowledged leader of a faction that opposed the programs of Governor A. B. " Happy " Chandler . He supported the state 's first legislation regulating strip mining , improved registration and election laws , and campaigned for revision of the state constitution . He also co @-@ sponsored the Minimum Foundation Program for Education . From 1952 to 1954 , Breathitt served as president of the Young Democrats Clubs of Kentucky and as a member of the national committee for the Young Democrats of America . He was chair of the state speaker 's bureau for Adlai Stevenson 's presidential campaign in 1952 , and two years later , he worked on the staff of Senator Alben Barkley 's re @-@ election campaign . 
 Bert T. Combs put Breathitt in charge of his campaign against Wilson Wyatt in the Democratic gubernatorial primary in 1958 . When Combs was elected governor in 1959 , he appointed Breathitt as State Personnel Commissioner , charging him with writing legislation to create a merit system for state employees . After successfully guiding the legislation through the General Assembly , Breathitt resigned as personnel commissioner to accept an appointment to the Kentucky Public Service Commission . He was also served as chair of a failed state constitutional convention in 1960 and was a member of the Governor 's Commission on Mental Health . 
 = = = 1963 gubernatorial campaign = = = 
 In 1962 , two @-@ time former governor and Democratic factional leader Happy Chandler had already begun his campaign for a third term as governor . The anti @-@ Chandler faction became concerned that , if they did not name a candidate , Chandler 's early announcement would give him an advantage in the 1963 election . Leaders of the faction were solidly behind state Highway Commissioner Henry Ward , but Governor Combs was leaning toward Breathitt . Breathitt announced his candidacy on May 2 , 1962 , but many in his party remained skeptical due to his youth and relative inexperience . Combs eventually convinced the anti @-@ Chandler faction to back Breathitt , and Ward never became a candidate . 
 During the primary campaign , Chandler focused his attacks on the Combs administration rather than the inexperienced Breathitt . A seasoned campaigner , he bitterly attacked the three percent sales tax enacted during the Combs administration . Breathitt struck back with accusations that , as a senator , Chandler had voted in favor of declaring war on Japan during World War II , but resigned his army commission shortly thereafter . He further charged that Chandler 's son @-@ in @-@ law was collecting campaign donations from individuals who desired favors from state government . The younger Breathitt , thirty @-@ eight years old when the campaign began , adapted well to the relatively new medium of television , while the aging Chandler did not . Breathitt won the primary by more than 60 @,@ 000 votes and carried all but one of the state 's congressional districts . Chandler 's running mate , Harry Lee Waterfield , easily won the nomination for lieutenant governor over Breathitt 's running mate , John B. Breckinridge , showing that the defeat was not so much a result of factionalism as a personal rebuff of Chandler . This campaign ended Chandler 's political career . 
 In the general election , Breathitt challenged Republican Louie B. Nunn . Still stinging from his primary defeat , Happy Chandler endorsed Nunn , which hurt Breathitt with some members of his own party . During the campaign , Nunn attacked an executive order issued by Governor Combs that desegregated public accommodations in Kentucky as " rule by executive decree " . Appearing on television with a copy of the executive order , Nunn proclaimed that " my first act will be to abolish this . " Nunn 's proclamation won him the support of some Democrats , but cost him Republican votes , especially in Louisville . The New Republic charged that Nunn ran " the first outright segregationist campaign in Kentucky . " Breathitt won the election by a margin of just over 13 @,@ 000 votes . 
 = = = Governor of Kentucky = = = 
 The first legislative session of Breathitt 's administration was a disappointment to his faction . His youth and narrow margin of victory in the election undermined his authority . Further , the unexpected death of Richard P. Moloney , a key legislative leader , was a blow to Breathitt 's ability to push his agenda through the General Assembly . The major accomplishment of the 1964 session was the approval of a $ 176 million bond issue to increased funding for roads , public education , the state park system , and social services . Other minor accomplishments included passing a purchasing law , strengthening strip mining regulations , and improving benefits for teachers . 
 Much of the 1964 session was devoted to a bill to desegregate public accommodations in Kentucky . A rally in favor of the bill was held in March and was attended by Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr . , Reverend Ralph Abernathy , and baseball player Jackie Robinson . Despite this , the bill did not make it out of legislative committee . As a member of the Southern Governors Conference in October 1964 , Breathitt was one of three governors to oppose George Wallace 's proposed constitutional amendment to give states and state courts sole jurisdiction over their public schools , preventing a federal law to integrate them . Breathitt 's opposition helped prevent the Conference 's endorsement of the amendment , since endorsement required a unanimous vote . 
 The 1964 General Assembly also passed legislation to draft a new state constitution . Thirty @-@ eight citizens were chosen to draft the new document , which was based on national models . County leaders opposed the document because of perceived threats to the independence of local governments and an apparent consolidation of power in Frankfort . Despite Breathitt 's strong support , the proposed constitution was defeated by Kentucky voters by an overwhelming margin of 510 @,@ 099 to 140 @,@ 210 . 
 Breathitt expanded the state park system and led the state to join the Tennessee Valley Authority in developing the Land Between the Lakes National Recreation Area . In 1965 , the Midwest Travel Writer 's Association presented Breathitt with its top national award for having the best travel promotion . That same year , he was named to the University of Kentucky Alumni Association Hall of Distinguished Alumni . 
 A June 1965 ruling by the Kentucky Court of Appeals that property must be assessed at its full value prompted calls for a special session from Kentucky taxpayers . Breathitt obliged , calling the session in July . He proposed a reduction in property tax rates to offset the increase in the assessed value of property , and also advocated small increased in other tax rates to benefit public schools . The plan passed despite opposition from Lieutenant Governor Harry Lee Waterfield . 
 The 1966 legislative session was much more successful for Breathitt . His economic development program , which led to construction or expansion of 749 industries , 57 @,@ 000 new jobs , and more than $ 1 billion in new plant investment , was recognized as the nation 's best by the Society of Industrial Investors in 1964 and generated an additional $ 100 million in state revenue . The pro @-@ administration majority in the legislature was expanded in the 1965 elections , and Waterfield , Breathitt 's sometimes hostile lieutenant governor , was stripped of much of his authority . Former governor Lawrence Wetherby was selected president pro tempore of the senate , providing effective leadership in that house of the General Assembly . Wetherby introduced a budget which was 27 percent larger than the previous one and contained appropriations for most of the state 's political districts . Wetherby 's leadership was so effective that the budget passed both houses of the Assembly , virtually unchanged , by votes of 99 – 0 and 31 – 5 only ten days later . 
 = = = = Kentucky Civil Rights Act = = = = 
 Passage of the national Civil Rights Act of 1964 had paved the way for an even stronger civil rights bill in the 1966 legislative session . The Assembly easily passed the Kentucky Civil Rights Act opening all public accommodations to people of every race and prohibiting racial discrimination in employment by firms that employed eight or more people . The act applied to many kinds of businesses not covered by the federal statute , and approximately ninety percent of the businesses in Kentucky were affected , compared to only sixty percent that were covered by the federal statute . The act was the first of its kind passed in a southern state . In 1966 , Breathitt was presented with the Lincoln Key Award for his leadership in the bill 's passage . In 1966 and 1967 , he was chair of the Southern Governors ' Conference 's Committee on Regional and Interstate Cooperation . He was also the only state governor named to the President 's Council on Human Rights . 
 Breathitt was a member of National Governors Conference Executive Committee in 1964 and 1965 and chaired its Natural Resources Committee . In the 1966 legislature , he won approval for several conservation measures , including the creation of an authority to regulate water , soil , and forest resources . The session also tightened strip mining laws to prohibit mining on mountainsides that were too steep to be restored . In 1967 , he was recognized with the U.S. Department of Interior 's Distinguished Service Award and Outdoor Life magazine 's Conservationist of the Year Award for his contributions to conservation . 
 Other accomplishments of the 1966 legislature included the passage of a compulsory vehicle inspection law , tightening of restrictions on political contributions and expenditures by candidates for political office , and approval of a legislative redistricting law . The governor 's road construction projects continued apace , and by the end of his term , Kentucky had more miles of highway under construction than any other state . 
 During his term as governor , Breathitt was chair of the Board of Trustees at the University of Kentucky . Under his leadership , the state 's community colleges were placed under the governance of the university . Four state colleges achieved university status during Breathitt 's administration . He also established the Kentucky Educational Television network and Kentucky 's vocational education system . 
 = = Later life and death = = 
 Breathitt was limited to one term by Kentucky 's constitution at the time . He returned to his legal practice in Hopkinsville , and in December 1967 , became Special Counsel in Kentucky for Southern Railway . In July 1968 , he was named director of the Ford Foundation 's Institute for Rural America , suggesting legislative remedies for poverty including the establishment of state area development districts . In 1971 , he helped found the Coalition for Rural America and was elected its chair . The Coalition worked to implement the suggestions of the Institute for Rural America . Breathitt also served as president of the American Child Centers to promote private preschool education and was appointed as the federal representative on the Southern Interstate Nuclear Board in September 1968 . When Southern Railway became part of Norfolk Southern Corporation in 1972 , Breathitt became vice @-@ president for public affairs , a position he held until his retirement in 1992 . 
 Breathitt was an important adviser to Governor John Y. Brown , Jr . , who appointed him to the University of Kentucky 's Board of Trustees in 1981 and 1982 . Breathitt 's wife Frances died of complications from cancer on July 11 , 1985 . On April 2 , 1988 , he married Lucy Alexander Winchester , a former social secretary to First Lady Pat Nixon and cousin to Libby Jones , wife of future Kentucky governor Brereton Jones . 
 Breathitt later served on the boards of regents of Kentucky State University and Morehead State University , in both cases serving with former political rival Louie B. Nunn . From 1992 to 2000 , he again served on the University of Kentucky 's board , acting as chairman of the board in all but his final year . During his chairmanship , he clashed with Governor Paul E. Patton over a plan to separate all of the state 's community colleges ( except Lexington Community College ) from the university 's governance and place them under a newly created body called the Kentucky Community and Technical College System . Patton 's plan prevailed , and he and Breathitt later mended political fences . 
 In 1992 , Breathitt joined the law firm of Wyatt , Tarrant , and Combs . He undertook several volunteer community service activities , including serving as director of Home Loan Bank in Cincinnati and chairman of the Kentucky Heart Fund . He was appointed to the Southern Region Education Board and the Kentucky Council on Higher Education . In 1994 , he was named to the Gatton College of Business Alumni Hall of Fame at the University of Kentucky ; in 1997 , he received a similar honor from the College of Law at the university . He also received an honorary doctorate from Murray State University in 1994 . In 1999 , he received the Henry Clay Medallion for Distinguished Service and in 2000 , Eastern Kentucky University 's Center for Kentucky History and Politics presented him with the John Sherman Cooper Award for Outstanding Public Service to Kentucky . He retired from the practice of law in 2002 . 
 While giving a speech at Lexington Community College on October 10 , 2003 , Breathitt collapsed due to ventricular fibrillation . He was resuscitated and admitted to the University of Kentucky Hospital but remained comatose and died on October 14 . He was buried at the Riverside Cemetery in Hopkinsville , Kentucky . In 2000 , the <unk> Parkway in western Kentucky was renamed the Edward T. Breathitt <unk> Parkway in his honor . 
 = The Playboy = 
 The Playboy is a graphic novel by Canadian cartoonist Chester Brown , serialized in 1990 in Brown 's comic book Yummy Fur and collected in different revised book editions in 1992 and 2013 . It deals with Brown 's guilt and anxiety over his obsessive masturbation to Playboy Playmate models . 
 The story begins with Brown 's first purchase of an issue of Playboy as a teenager . His obsessive masturbating gives him great guilt and anxiety , and out of fear of being caught he repeatedly rids himself of copies of the magazine , only to retrieve them later . His conflicting emotions follow him into adulthood until he purges them by revealing himself through his comics . The free , organic arrangement of odd @-@ shaped panels of simple , expressive artwork contrasts with Brown 's more detailed grid @-@ like pages in his 1980s work , such as Ed the Happy Clown . 
 The Playboy forms part of Brown 's early @-@ 1990s autobiographical period , and was the first book @-@ length work he planned as a complete story . Brown conceived it as a longer work with what became his next graphic novel , I Never Liked You ( 1994 ) , but found the larger story too complex to handle at once . The story has attracted praise for its revealing honesty and criticism from those who saw it as glorifying pornography . Playboy publisher Hugh Hefner wrote Brown to express concern over Brown 's sexual anxieties in a post @-@ sexual revolution world . 
 = = Background = = 
 Chester Brown grew up in Châteauguay , a Montreal suburb with a large English @-@ speaking minority ; he does not speak French . He described himself as a " nerdy teenager " attracted to comic books from a young age . He sought a career drawing superhero comics , but was unsuccessful in finding work with Marvel or DC after graduating from high school . He moved to Toronto and discovered underground comix and the small @-@ press community . He began to self @-@ publish a minicomic in 1983 titled Yummy Fur . 
 From 1986 Toronto @-@ based Vortex Comics began publishing Yummy Fur . After making a name for himself in alternative comics with the surreal serial Ed the Happy Clown , Brown turned to autobiography after reading such work by Julie Doucet and Joe Matt . The work of his friend and fellow Toronto cartoonist Seth inspired Brown to pare down his drawing style during the early 1990s . He tentatively began his autobiographical period with a pair of short tales , and gradually became freer with his panel layouts and simpler in his artwork . 
 = = Content = = 
 The autobiographical story takes place in Chester " Chet " Brown 's hometown of Châteauguay in 1975 , when Brown was 15 . It details his obsession with the Playmates in Playboy magazine . Brown 's character obsessively masturbates in secret , terrified of being found out , but unable to resist the urge . Afterwards he feels guilty and sometimes rids himself of the magazines , only to retrieve them . As an adult , he sometimes <unk> copies of issues he had discarded . 
 The story takes place primarily during Brown 's adolescence and finishes at the time of the book 's creation . Brown uses a bat @-@ winged figure with his own face to narrate the story and goad Chet in a way similar to the trope of the angel and devil on the shoulders . Chet never acknowledges the narrator , who appears to be visible only to the reader . The narrator talks about Brown in the third person in the adolescent parts of the story , but in the first person in Brown 's adult years . 
 = = = Synopsis = = = 
 The story opens in church , where the winged narrator cajoles the adolescent Chet to buy a Playboy magazine he had seen for sale . Chet works up the courage to buy it at a convenience store a considerable distance from his house , in the hope that no one will see him there . 
 After bringing it home and masturbating to it , he disposes of the magazine by hiding it under a plank of wood in the woods near his house . His building obsession battles his guilt , and eventually he returns for it , a situation which repeats itself throughout the story . His obsession so overcomes him that , even when his mother dies while he is at camp , his first thought at returning home is to retrieve the Playboy he has hidden in the woods . As an adult , he hunts down back issues and memorizes dates and names of Playmate models , and disposes of them over the guilt he feels or his fear of being found out by a girlfriend . His obsession interferes with his relations with women : he relates that , while seeing one girlfriend , he could only maintain an erection for her by fantasizing about his favourite Playmates , and that he preferred masturbation to having sex with her . 
 The Playboy finishes with Brown drawing the story in progress . Though he knows his friends shortly will read it , he still feels uncomfortable discussing it with them . 
 = = Style and analysis = = 
 By the end of the 1980s Brown had grown dissatisfied with his drawing style . He began simplifying it after bringing Ed the Happy Clown to an end , as he had been reading work by cartoonists with simpler styles such as John Stanley and Brown 's friend Seth . He abandoned the grid layout that he had used and arranged panels on the page in a varied , organic manner . He made the drawings first and only afterwards laid down panel borders , which conform to the shapes of the pictures they enclose and are in a wobbly free @-@ hand – much like those of the Hernandez brothers or Robert Crumb . Brown distorted his images to convey emotion , but not in traditional cartoonish ways . For example , when the adolescent Brown encounters friends of his parents , he does not physically shrink with embarrassment , but does so through distortion of perspective . 
 Brown depicts Chet 's obsessive masturbation , and his uncommon masturbation style has drawn notice : he faces down and rubs his penis between the palms of both hands , a style which has come to be known as doing " the Chester " , after a cartoon of it by Peter Bagge . He feels terrified of being caught masturbating and his regret afterwards drives him continually to rid himself of the magazines , such as by hiding them in the woods near his house , but always returns for them . Brown 's mother dies while he is at camp , which is mentioned only briefly , as when he returns from camp he immediately heads to the woods to dig up the Playboy he had buried there . Comics critic Darcy Sullivan sees Brown in this scene having " shunted aside his painful feelings for her , and for other women , in favor of this tatty fetish " . Chet is introverted and self @-@ isolating , preferring pornography to communicating with others , such as his brother . 
 When finishing The Playboy , Brown felt guilt over still looking at Playmates and credits having come out in print with helping him overcome his shame . While many have interpreted the book as a condemnation of pornography , to Brown it is about the guilt he was made to feel for using the media . Some interpretations , such as those of Sullivan and Darrel Epp , see The Playboy demonstrating how the idealized images in pornography distort societal norms and expectations of beauty ; one example cited is a scene in which Brown says he could only maintain an erection with one girlfriend if he fantasized about his favourite Playmates . Brown has objected to this interpretation — rather , he sees it as a flaw in the work , in that it does not provide enough context for what he intended to communicate : that he had gotten into a relationship with a woman whom he did not find sexually attractive , and that if Playboy did not exist he would have fantasized about other images of women . 
 Critic Darcy Sullivan saw the book as presenting how Brown 's Playboy obsession affects his ability to relate to women . Sullivan called The Playboy stories " [ t ] he most honest sex in comics " of the early 1990s , " and the most damning exposé of pornography " as it deals " with nothing more than Brown 's relationship with Playboy " . He praises how quickly Brown matured as a storyteller over the course of The Playboy , and for the believability of scenes which may or may not have happened as Brown depicted them . While seeming to acknowledge feminist concerns , Brown depicts himself as " a victim of his urges " , and that " Playboy has kept him mentally separate " . Sullivan asserts the book shows that pornography does not merely satisfy a need , but fosters an addiction . Brown 's comics raise questions , rather than trying to answer them , an approach Sullivan compared favourably to that of Joe Matt 's less subtle body of work , which also details a pornography obsession : he wrote that Matt 's comics analyze and rationalize his obsession , while Brown 's reveal . 
 = = Publication = = 
 Brown had run into problems doing autobiographical stories of his contemporary life , as his story interconnected with the stories of those around him — the friends he portrayed did not always agree with the way he pictured them . He portrays his friend Kris 's negative reaction in " Showing Helder " to his depiction of her in " Helder " . Brown turned to tales of his teenage years , as he had lost contact with most of those he knew from that time . Brown stated that he intended a longer story encompassing what ended up in The Playboy and the following graphic novel , I Never Liked You ( 1994 ) , but when planning it he found it was too complex . He said he had a clear idea of the stories from his life that he would use , and the general shape of the narrative , but he had a " sense of improvising " as he did not script it out beforehand . 
 The serialization appeared under the title Disgust in issues # 21 – 23 of Yummy Fur , at the time published by Vortex Comics . With the twenty @-@ fifth issue of Yummy Fur in 1991 , Brown switched publishers to the Montreal @-@ based Drawn and Quarterly , who published a collected and revised edition of The Playboy in 1992 ; this was the first graphic novel from the publisher . Brown <unk> , <unk> , and reformatted the book for an annotated edition in 2013 , also from Drawn and Quarterly . 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 The story gained praise from fans , critics , and other cartoonists , and earned a Harvey Award nomination in 1991 for Best Single Issue or Story . The Playboy , I Never Liked You , and several shorter pieces placed No. 38 on The Comics Journal 's list of the best 100 English @-@ language comics of the 20th century as " The autobiographical comics from Yummy Fur " . Cartoonist Gilbert Hernandez asserted , " The Playboy and I Never Liked You are probably the best graphic novels next to Maus " . Critic Frank Young called it a " pivotal work " in the autobiographical comics trend of the early 1990s . Critic Darcy Sullivan considered it required reading for those who are serious about comics and a " landmark look at an artist 's growth " , referring to the pace with which Brown 's work matured over the course of the three issues of its serialization . 
 Brown stated that several women took offense at the book , saying it glorified pornography . Hugh Hefner sent Brown a letter after The Playboy 's publication , showing concern that someone who grew up during the sexual revolution could still suffer such confusion and anxiety . Darcy Sullivan compared the pornography @-@ obsessed autobiographical work of Joe Matt in Peepshow unfavourably to The Playboy in an issue of The Comics Journal , to which Brown responded with a defence of Matt 's work in a later issue . 
 Brown 's attitudes towards pornography changed dramatically over time . When he made The Playboy he was struggling with his embarrassment over buying pornography ; two decades later he vocally advocated for the decriminalization of prostitution in Paying for It ( 2011 ) . 
 = Hunter v Moss = 
 Hunter v Moss [ 1994 ] 1 WLR 452 is an English trusts law case from the Court of Appeal concerning the certainty of subject matter necessary to form a trust . Moss promised Hunter 50 shares in his company as part of an employment contract , but failed to provide them . Hunter brought a claim against Moss for them , arguing that Moss 's promise had created a trust over those 50 shares . The constitution of trusts normally requires that trust property be segregated from non @-@ trust property for the trust to be valid , as in Re London Wine Co ( Shippers ) Ltd . On this occasion , however , both Colin Rimer in the High Court of Justice and Dillon , Mann and Hirst LJJ in the Court of Appeal felt that , because this case dealt with intangible rather than tangible property , this rule did not have to be applied . Because all the shares were identical , it did not matter that they were not segregated , and the trust was valid . The decision was applied in Re Harvard Securities , creating a rule that segregation is not always necessary when the trust concerns intangible , identical property . 
 The academic reaction to Hunter was mixed . While some called it " fair , sensible and workable " , or noted that " Logically the decision in Hunter v Moss appears a sensible one " , Alastair Hudson felt that " doctrinally , it is suggested that the decision in Hunter v Moss is wrong and should not be relied upon " , because it contradicted existing property law and drew a distinction between tangible and intangible property he felt to be " spurious " . 
 = = Facts = = 
 Moss was the founder and director of Moss Electrical Co Ltd , and owned 950 of the 1 @,@ 000 available shares . In September 1986 he said that Hunter , the finance director , could have 50 of these shares as part of his employment . Crucially , he made no statement or trust involving the other 900 shares . This gift of 50 shares was never implemented because of tax concerns , the risks of a takeover , and mainly because Moss changed his mind . Hunter brought a case against Moss claiming his 50 shares , which rested on two issues . First , whether the language used was sufficient to create a trust , and second , whether or not the trust failed to provide the three certainties because of the lack of segregation between the shares . 
 Prior to Hunter , a valid trust required three certainties – certainty of intention ( that the donor intended to make a trust ) certainty of subject matter ( that the property to make up the trust was identifiable ) and certainty of object ( that the beneficiaries were identifiable ) . The normal rule for certainty of subject matter is that the property intended to be in the trust be separated from other property , showing clarity in what is intended to be trust property . If there is no clear separation , the trust will fail . Re London Wine Co concerned creditors of a bankrupt wine trading company , who argued that they should be able to claim the bottles of wine they had paid for . The problem was that these bottles were not individually identifiable , and Oliver J held that : 
 I appreciate the point taken that the subject matter is a part of a homogeneous mass so that specific identity is of as little as importance as it is , for instance , in the case of money . Nevertheless , as it seems to me , to create a trust it must be possible to ascertain with certainty not only what the interest of the beneficiary is to be but to what property it is to attach . 
 = = Judgment = = 
 In the High Court Colin Rimer QC , sitting as a Deputy High Court Judge , held that since the shares were all identical , the lack of segregation between them did not invalidate the trust . The standard case in this area , Re London Wine Co ( Shippers ) Ltd , was distinguished because the subject matter there was potentially different , while all of Moss 's shares were identical . Rimer J instead cited with approval <unk> v National Bank of Commerce in St. Louis , a decision of the Supreme Court of Minnesota where it was held that there was no need for segregation in such a situation . 
 On appeal , the Court of Appeal held there was a valid trust . Giving the leading judgment Dillon LJ said the trust was valid , first , because it was necessary for there to be one to enforce the terms of the employment contract . Second , he distinguished Re London Wine Co , saying , " That case is a long way from the present . It is concerned with the appropriation of chattels and when property in chattels passes . We are concerned with a declaration of trust " . He instead concluded that as there was no tangible distinction between the shares , and as such no reason to hold the trust void just because the shares had not been segregated . As such , the trust was valid . 
 = = Significance = = 
 Hunter is commonly cited as having said that with intangible , identical property , it is not necessary to segregate the trust and non @-@ trust sections . In fact Dillon LJ never said such a thing , although " it is the obvious conclusion to draw [ from his statement ] " . He merely distinguished Re London Wine Co , allowing him to decide the case on the facts alone . Hunter was reluctantly applied in Re Harvard Securities , where Neuberger J reluctantly decided that it had said there was no need to segregate intangible property . 
 Outside of England and Wales , the decision has not been applied . In White v <unk> , the Supreme Court of New South Wales explicitly rejected Dillon 's reasoning . Campbell J nonetheless reached the same conclusion ( that a settlor could declare a valid trust of an <unk> parcel of shares that was part of a larger fund ) , albeit by different reasoning . 
 The case met a mixed reaction from academics . Jill Martin , in an article in the <unk> and Property Lawyer , argued that the case was " fair , sensible and workable ... [ it ] is a welcome example of the court 's policy of preventing a clearly intended trust from failing for uncertainty " . Alison Jones , in a different article for the same journal , said that " Logically the decision in Hunter v Moss appears a sensible one " , but noted that it did create " difficult questions " . Other academics were more critical , with David Hayton writing in the Law Quarterly Review that " the unreserved judgment of Dillon LJ .... may well come to be stigmatised " . 
 Alastair Hudson wrote that " doctrinally , it is suggested that the decision in Hunter v Moss is wrong and should not be relied upon " . Firstly , it contradicts an element of property law which requires there be " specific and identifiable property " to be subject to a property right . Secondly , he suggests it is difficult to see why there should be a dividing line between intangible and tangible property , since there are some principles which apply to both . 500 ball bearings are tangible , but identical ; under Hunter , there is no reason these should also not require separation , so the distinction between tangible and intangible is thus " spurious " . 
 = Ignacy Potocki = 
 Count Roman Ignacy Potocki , generally known as Ignacy Potocki , ( Polish pronunciation : [ <unk> ͡ <unk> <unk> ͡ skʲi ] ; 1750 – 1809 ) was a Polish nobleman , member of the influential magnate Potocki family , owner of <unk> and <unk> ( near <unk> ) , a politician , writer , and office holder . He was the Marshal of the Permanent Council ( Rada <unk> ) in 1778 – 1782 , Grand Clerk of Lithuania from 1773 , Court Marshal of Lithuania from 1783 , Grand Marshal of Lithuania from 16 April 1791 to 1794 . 
 He was an educational activist , member of the Commission of National Education and the initiator and president of Society for Elementary Textbooks . He was an opponent of king Stanisław II August in the 1770s and 1780s , and a major figure in the Polish politics of that era . During the Great Sejm he was a leader of the Patriotic Party and the reform movement and eventually backed the King in many reform projects . An advocate of a pro @-@ Prussian orientation , he helped conclude an alliance with Prussia in 1790 . He co @-@ authored the Constitution of 3 May 1791 .

 Potocki was born in <unk> on 28 February 1750 into the influential magnate Potocki family . He was the son of Eustachy Potocki and Marianna <unk> , brother of Jerzy Michał Potocki , Jan Nepomucen Eryk Potocki and Stanisław Kostka Potocki . 
 Potocki was an alumnus of the Collegium Nobilium in Warsaw , where he was a student in the years 1761 – 1765 . From 1765 he studied theology and law in Rome , where he attended the Collegium <unk> , up to about 1769 . His parents intended for him to join the ranks of clergy , but he refused to follow this path . After traveling through Italy and Germany , he returned to Poland around 1771 . On 27 December 1772 he married Elżbieta Lubomirska . This marriage brought him close to the political faction of Familia . Early on , Potocki made a major impression on many of his contemporaries , being groomed as the next leader of Familia . From 1772 he was invited to the King Stanisław II Augustus ' Thursday Dinners .

 As a member ( 1772 – 1791 ) of Poland 's Commission of National Education ( Komisja Edukacji Narodowej ) – the world 's first ministry of education – he was the initiator of and presided over the Society for Elementary Textbooks ( Towarzystwo do <unk> <unk> , founded in 1775 ) . He presided over the renovation of the Załuski 's Library ( in 1774 ) . He was involved in the development of numerous projects , such as the history curriculum . In 1781 he reviewed and endorsed Hugo Kołłątaj 's work at the Cracow Academy . His involvement with the educational projects earned him a nickname <unk> ( holder of <unk> degree , teacher ) . His involvement with the educational reforms lessened only during the era of the Great Sejm ( 1788 – 1792 ) , when he became increasingly involved with the wider reform program . 
 On 29 May 1773 he received the office of Great Clerk ( Writer ) of Lithuania , a relatively low @-@ ranked position that was seen by some as below the magnates of the Potocki family . He participated in the Partition Sejm of 1773 , where he sat on several commissions . Seeing himself in opposition to the king , he refused a seat on the Permanent Council that he was offered in March 1774 . The king tried to appease him with the Order of Saint Stanislaus on 14 July that year , but that failed to bring Potocki to his side . Instead , Potocki became , for the next decade and half , one of his chief political critics and opponents ; on 1776 he went to Moscow to argue , unsuccessfully , for limiting the power of king and the Russian ambassador , Otto Magnus von Stackelberg . Later that year , his election to the Sejm was disputed , and the king and Stackelberg managed to block his election . In 1778 however , the growing rift between the king and Stackelberg allowed him to take , through political maneuvering , the chairmanship of the Permanent Council Marshal of the Sejm . That year he also became a Knight of the Order of the White Eagle . 
 In 1779 Potocki joined the freemasonry , and by 1780 he advanced to the head of a freemasonry lodge . He became de facto head of the " Familia " , and of anti @-@ royal opposition ( succeeding its previous leader , Stanisław Lubomirski , upon his death in 1783 ) . That year also saw the sudden death of his wife . During a trip to Italy and France , in absentia , the influence of the Familia resulted in his appointment to the office of the Court Marshal of Lithuania . He continued to oppose various royal projects at the Sejms of 1784 and 1786 . In 1785 he lost some face for his involvement in the <unk> affair , in which the king was falsely accused of an instigation of a poisoning attempt . 
 Disappointed with Russia 's lack of support for any serious reforms in Poland , he shifted to favoring an alliance with the Kingdom of Prussia instead . Although this resulted in the split of the anti @-@ royalist opposition , he was seen as the leader of opposition ( the Patriotic Party ) when the Great Sejm begun in 1788 . After some initial political <unk> , the issues of a closer relation with Prussia ( that would eventually grew into the Polish @-@ Prussian alliance ) and a major reform of the government , both with which he was closely involved , begun accelerating in 1789 . At first supportive more of a republican form of a government , political reality ( such as royal faction victory at the elections of 1790 ) resulted in his acceptance of a more constitutional monarchy approach . In 1790 , through the mediation of Scipione Piattoli , the king and Potocki begun drifting closer together , working on a draft document that would eventually become the 3 May 1791 constitution . Alongside Poniatowski , Kołłątaj and Piattoli , he is seen as one of the major authors of that document . He supported the quasi @-@ coup d 'état in which the constitution was passed on 3 May 1791 . 
 On 17 May 1791 , he had to resign his position in the Commission of National Education to take an appointment ( Minister of Police ) in the newly created government , the Guard of Laws . From March 1792 he also held the position of Minister of War . During the War in the Defence of the Constitution in 1792 he went on an unsuccessful diplomatic mission to Berlin to request assistance from the Prussian government . On 4 July 1792 a sudden depression made him resign his ministerial positions . A vocal opponent of the Targowica Confederation and likely an author of an anonymous anti @-@ Targowica brochure , he was specifically requested by the Russian government to not be involved in the negotiations ; he also refused to join the Targowica Confederation , even after Poniatowski 's accession to it . 
 = = = Final years = = = 
 Following the victory of the Targowica Confederation and the abrogation of the May 3rd Constitution , Potocki emigrated from the Polish – Lithuanian Commonwealth , settling in Leipzig . Together with Tadeusz Kościuszko , he proposed a plan for a French @-@ Polish alliance of republics , that was however not met with much support in France . He co @-@ authored a work with Hugo Kołłątaj , On the Adoption and Fall of the Polish Constitution of 3 May ( O <unk> i <unk> Konstytucji Polskiej 3 @-@ go Maja , 1793 ) . 
 Potocki participated in preparations for the Kościuszko Uprising of 1794 . In early April he left Leipzig and arrived in Kraków . He was involved in unsuccessful diplomatic <unk> with various foreign powers , in a vain attempt to gain support for the insurgents . During the Uprising he served as a member of the Supreme National Council ( Rada <unk> Narodowa ) , as a chief of its diplomatic department . Upon suppression of the Uprising , instead of emigrating again , he took part in the surrender negotiations , which gained him respect in many quarters . Eventually on 21 December 1794 he was imprisoned by the Tsarist Russian authorities . He has lost most of his wealth following the Uprising , as most of his estates were confiscated . Near the end of his life he would be troubled by his inability to pay off debts from the 1780s . 
 Released in 1796 , following the death of Catherine the Great , Potocki retired to <unk> , Galicia ( southern Poland ) . There he devoted himself to historical studies , publishing several books , translations and commentaries . He also wrote poems , but those were never published during his <unk> . Historians still debate over his potential authorship of several anonymous works ( primarily political brochures ) . He distanced himself from activists discussing a new insurrection , but was nonetheless arrested and imprisoned by the Austrian authorities again in the years 1798 – 1800 . In 1801 he joined the Warsaw Scientific Society . He returned to politics shortly after much of Galicia was liberated by Napoleon and attached to the Duchy of Warsaw . During the negotiations with Napoleon in Dresden he contracted severe diarrhea and died on 30 August 1809 . He was buried in <unk> . 
 He had no direct descendants , his daughters died in infancy . His reduced estates were inherited by a nephew , Aleksander Potocki . 
 = = Remembrance = = 
 In private life , he is said to have had a weakness for gambling , but he also had a reputation of an honest reformer , who puts the good of the country above his own . 
 He is one of the figures immortalized in Jan Matejko 's 1891 painting , Constitution of 3 May 1791 . 
 = Orford Castle = 
 Orford Castle is a castle in the village of Orford , Suffolk , England , located 12 miles ( 20 km ) northeast of Ipswich , with views over the Orford Ness . It was built between 1165 and 1173 by Henry II of England to consolidate royal power in the region . The well @-@ preserved keep , described by historian R. Allen Brown as " one of the most remarkable keeps in England " , is of a unique design and probably based on Byzantine architecture . The keep still stands among the earth @-@ covered remains of the outer fortifications . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = 12th century = = = 
 Prior to the building of Orford Castle , Suffolk was dominated by the Bigod family , who held the title of the Earl of Norfolk and owned key castles at Framlingham , Bungay , Walton and Thetford . Hugh Bigod had been one of a group of dissenting barons during the Anarchy in the reign of King Stephen , and Henry II wished to re @-@ establish royal influence across the region . Henry confiscated the four castles from Hugh , but returned Framlingham and Bungay to Hugh in 1165 . Henry then decided to build his own royal castle at Orford , near Framlingham , and construction work began in 1165 , concluding in 1173 . The Orford site was around two miles ( 3 @.@ 2 km ) from the sea , lying on flat ground with swampy terrain slowly stretching away down to the river Ore , about half a mile ( 0 @.@ 8 km ) away . 
 The design of the keep was unique , and has been termed " one of the most remarkable keeps in England " by historian R. Allen Brown . The 90 @-@ foot ( 27 metre ) high central tower was circular in cross @-@ section with three rectangular , clasping towers built out from the 49 @-@ foot ( 15 metre ) wide structure . The tower was based on a precise set of proportions , its various dimensions following the one to the root of two ratio found in many English churches of the period . Much of the interior is built with high @-@ quality ashlar stonework , with broad , 5 foot 6 inch ( 1 @.@ 7 metre ) wide staircases . The best chambers were designed to catch the early morning sun , whilst the various parts of the keep were draught @-@ proofed with doors and carefully designed windows . Originally the roof of the keep , above the upper hall , would have formed a domed effect , with a tall steeple above that . 
 The keep was surrounded by a curtain wall with probably four flanking towers and a fortified gatehouse protecting a relatively small bailey ; these outer defences , rather than the keep , probably represented the main defences of the castle . The marshes nearby were drained turning the village of Orford into a sheltered port . The castle , including the surrounding ditch , palisade and stone bridge , cost £ 1 @,@ 413 to build , with the work possibly being conducted by the master mason <unk> . Some of the timbers were brought from as far away as Scarborough , and the detailed stonework being carved from limestone from Caen in Normandy , the remainder of the stone being variously from local mudstone and coralline , as well as limestone from Northamptonshire . 
 The design of the keep has attracted much historical interest . Traditional explanations for its unusual plan argued that the castle was a transitional military design , combining both the circular features of later castles with the square angled buttresses of earlier Norman fortifications . More recent scholarship has critiqued this explanation . The design of the Orford keep is hard to justify in military terms , as the buttresses created additional blind spots for the defenders , whilst the chambers and staircase in the corners weakened the walls against attack . Square Norman keeps continued to be built after Orford , whilst Henry II was aware of fully circular castle designs before building the keep . A round keep was constructed at New Buckenham , Norfolk , in 1146 , for example . Historians have therefore questioned to what extent the design can be seen as legitimately transitional . Instead , historians now believe that the design of Orford Castle was instead probably driven by political symbolism . Heslop argues that the plain , simple elegance of the architecture would , for mid @-@ 12th century nobility , have summoned up images of King Arthur , who was then widely believed to have had Roman or Greek links . The banded , angular features of the keep resembled the Theodosian Walls of Constantinople , then the idealised image of imperial power , and the keep as a whole , including the roof , may have been based on a hall that had been recently built in Constantinople by John II Komnenos . 
 = = = 13th to 15th centuries = = = 
 By the start of the 13th century , royal authority over Suffolk had been firmly established , after Henry II crushed the Bigods in the revolt of 1173 – 1174 , Orford being heavily garrisoned during the conflict , with 20 knights being based there . Upon the collapse of the rebellion , Henry ordered the permanent confiscation of Framlingham Castle . The political importance of Orford Castle diminished after Henry 's death in 1189 , although the port of Orford grew in importance , however , handling more trade than the more famous port of Ipswich by the beginning of the century . 
 The castle was captured by Prince Louis of France who invaded England in 1216 at the invitation of the English barons who were disillusioned with King John . John Fitz @-@ Robert became the governor of the royal castle under the young Henry III , followed by Hubert de Burgh . Under Edward I governorship of the castle was given to the de <unk> family , and it passed by marriage to Robert de Ufford , the 1st Earl of Suffolk , who was granted it in perpetuity by Edward III in 1336 . No longer a royal castle , Orford was passed on through the Willoughby , Stanhope and Devereux families , whilst the surrounding economy of Orford went into decline . The estuary of the River Ore silted up and the Orford Ness spit increased , making the harbour access more difficult , resulting in a decline in trade , reducing the importance of the castle as the centre of local government . 
 The castle and surrounding lands were bought by the Seymour @-@ Conway family in 1754 . By the late @-@ 18th century only the north wall of the bailey survived and the roof and upper floors of the keep had badly decayed , and Francis Seymour @-@ Conway , the 2nd Marquess of Hertford , proposed destroying the building in 1805 . He was prevented from doing so by the government , on the grounds that the keep formed a valuable landmark for ships approaching from Holland , wishing to avoid the nearby sandbanks . Francis ' son , also called Francis , undertook conservation efforts in 1831 , installing a new , relatively flat , lead roof and a replacement upper floor installed . Francis furnished the top of the keep for use as an apartment by guests . By the 1840s , however , all of the surrounding bailey wall and mural towers had almost vanished , having been quarried for stone , and the foundations could only just be seen . 
 = = = Modern period = = = 
 Sir Arthur Churchman bought Orford Castle in 1928 , and in 1930 gave the property to the Orford Town Trust ; an appeal for money to maintain and restore it began shortly afterwards . During the Second World War the castle was refortified with barbed wire to form what was originally intended to be an anti @-@ aircraft emplacement , with Nissen huts erected around the keep . The castle was instead used as a radar emplacement , and a concrete floor was installed in the south @-@ east tower to support the equipment . These buildings were removed at the end of the conflict . 
 Orford Castle was given to the Ministry of Works in 1962 , and is now maintained by English Heritage . The keep of the castle is the only part of the structure remaining intact , although the earthwork remains of the bailey wall are still visible ; some of the ditches visible amongst the earthworks , however , are not medieval , but instead the result of the earlier quarrying of the bailey walls . The Orford Museum Trust has created exhibits in the upper hall featuring displays of archaeological artefacts found locally . Archaeological work to understand the surrounding environment has continued , most recently during 2002 to 2003 . The castle is a scheduled monument and a Grade I listed building . 
 = = Wild Man of Orford = = 
 Orford Castle is associated with the legend of the Wild Man of Orford . According to the chronicler Ralph of Coggeshall , a naked wild man , covered in hair , was caught in the nets of local fishermen around 1167 . The man was brought back to the castle where he was held for six months , being questioned or tortured ; he said nothing , and behaved in a feral fashion throughout . The wild man finally escaped from the castle . Later accounts described the captive as a merman , and the incident appears to have encouraged the growth in " wild men " carvings on local baptismal fonts - around twenty such fonts from the later medieval period exist in coastal areas of Suffolk and Norfolk , near Orford .

 = = History = = 
 As per folk legend , Thiruvarur is mentioned as the capital town of a legendary Chola king , Manu <unk> Cholan , who killed his own son to provide justice to a cow . His name is commonly used as a metaphor for fairness and justice in Tamil literature and Tamil culture . 
 Thiruvarur was one of the five traditional capitals of the Chola empire and the history of town revolves around the <unk> temple . Thiruvarur is mentioned in the <unk> canonical work , Tevaram by Thirugnana <unk> , Tirunavukkarasar and Sundarar , the foremost Saivite saints of 7th – 8th century CE and classified as <unk> <unk> stalam . Tirunavukkarasar mentions several traditions of the temple like <unk> <unk> <unk> , Panguni <unk> <unk> and <unk> <unk> Panni . The granite structure of the temple was first constructed by Aditya Chola I ( 871 – 907 CE ) in the 9th century CE and revamped during the reign of Rajaraja Chola I ( 985 – 1014 CE ) . The temple was upgraded and rebuilt with stone by Rajendra Chola I ( 1012 – 44 CE ) . The temple has inscriptions from both the emperors , later Cholas and Pandyas . The temple is believed to be an inspiration for Rajaraja Chola to build the Brihadeeswarar Temple , a UNESCO World Heritage Site . 
 Inscriptions from the temple indicate Thiruvarur as the capital of Kulothunga Chola I ( 1070 – 1120 CE ) , during which the town emerged a centre of <unk> . After the fall of Cholas during the reign of Rajendra Chola II in the 13th century CE , the town was caught under a power struggle between Pandyas and Hoysalas . The royal patronage continued and the town flourished as a cultural centre during the rule of the Nayaks , Vijayanagar kings and Marathas . During the period of Marathas , the town became a temporary home to the Nataraja of Chidambaram temple . The town was briefly captured by French troops led by Lally ( 1702 – 66 CE ) in 1759 CE . The <unk> temple was ransacked in a failed attempt to discover hidden treasure . During the attempt , six brahmins of the temple , suspected to be spies of the British , were killed in an encounter . The province and Tanjore were annexed by British after the failed attempt of the French to attack the King of Tanjore . After independence , <unk> continued to be a part of the Thanjavur district and Nagapattinam district till 1991 and 1997 respectively . Thiruvarur was made the headquarters of Tiruvarur district when it was carved out of Nagapattinam district in 1997 .

 = Pre @-@ Madonna = 
 Pre @-@ Madonna is a collection of demos by American singer Madonna . The album was released in 1997 by Stephen Bray , who was the producer of the songs when they were recorded , and was distributed by <unk> . It was released as In the Beginning in European countries . Madonna met up with Bray , her former boyfriend , in 1980 when she was trying to establish her music career . She had left the band Breakfast Club and enlisted Bray 's help to further her career . Together they started writing songs and recorded them at New York 's Music Building studio . The songs recorded at that time — seven of which were written solely by Madonna — were released in Pre @-@ Madonna . 
 Although not authorized by Madonna , Bray decided to release Pre @-@ Madonna by remixing some of the tracks , and keeping the others in their original form . Included were the demo versions of " Everybody " and " Burning Up " which Madonna used for her self @-@ titled debut album . Bray chose to coincide the release of the album with the birth of Madonna 's daughter Lourdes , to cash @-@ in the publicity . The album received mixed reviews , with some critics deeming the release as unnecessary , while others were delighted to hear Madonna 's original recordings . 
 = = Background = = 
 In 1979 , Madonna was trying to establish her career in the music industry . She was the drummer of a band called Breakfast Club , which was headed by the Gilroy brothers , Dan and Ed . After their lead female vocalist left , Madonna was given the role of the lead female singer . However , she wanted to be the only female voice of the band , and opposed against the introduction of another female vocalist , Angie Smith . This led to a dispute between Dan and her , which resulted in Madonna leaving the band . She then formed a new band called Madonna and The Sky , but that also faced a major problem within a few weeks when its principal drummer Mike Shenoy , who had a full @-@ time job and a fiancé , decided to leave the band . 
 Undaunted by Shenoy 's departure , Madonna partnered up with her Michigan boyfriend Stephen Bray . Bray and Madonna had met at the University of Michigan in 1976 , where he was working as a waiter in a club at Ann Arbor . Bray used to take Madonna on the tours of his band ; after their romance ended , they remained good friends . When Madonna telephoned Bray to come and join the band , he immediately accepted and joined as the drummer replacing Shenoy . Madonna 's main focus now was to become a professional singer , and she asked Bray to help her achieve that . Together they started writing songs and recorded them under Gotham Records , in New York 's rehearsal studio called the Music Building . The songs recorded included " Ain 't No Big Deal " , " Laugh to Keep from Crying " , " Crimes of Passion " and " Stay " . Bray was the producer of these recordings , along with some demos that Madonna had recorded , including " Everybody " and " Burning Up " . The latter two songs were accepted for Madonna 's self @-@ titled debut album , in a reworked version ; however the demos were left with Bray . 
 = = Composition = = 
 When Bray decided to release the demo tracks in an album , he remixed some of them for a more contemporary appeal . " Ain 't No Big Deal " was re @-@ recorded and released as the B @-@ side to her singles " True Blue " and " Papa Don 't Preach " . The track features Madonna 's typical high @-@ pitched vocal timbre of that time , and talks about a carefree woman proclaiming her love . " Stay " and " Don 't You Know " were combined into one song , " Stay " , which was included on the Like a Virgin album . The songs use triple @-@ rhythms and double @-@ tracked vocals and includes a noise resembling someone slapping a microphone and a spoken sequence which fades away in the end . The 1981 versions of " Everybody " , " Burning Up " and " Ain 't No Big Deal " are the pure demo versions of officially released songs whose titles are tagged with the year in which they were recorded to differentiate them from the officially @-@ released versions . 
 According to Rikky Rooksby , author of The Complete Guide to the Music of Madonna , " Everybody " demo version is more or less same as the single version , without the synth grooves added in it . Similarly , the demo " Burning Up " does not contain the guitar riffs of the single version . Larry Flick from Billboard described " Crimes of Passion " as " disco @-@ spiced " . The song talks about how infidelity can actually set one free from a doomed relationship . Madonna 's voice sounds fuller in the verses and chorus , but takes a higher pitch in the bridge . " Laugh to Keep from Crying " is a rock song , with 12 @-@ string Rickenbacker guitar played by Madonna herself . Madonna 's voice sounds drunk and the drum machine backs her voice in the chorus . AllMusic compared her sound on the song to that of The Pretenders . According to Bray , " [ Pre @-@ Madonna ] carve the dance sound of a generation and chronicle Madonna 's first musical self @-@ definition phase . " 
 = = Release and reception = = 
 At the time the compilation was released , Madonna was riding a wave of publicity as a result of the film Evita and her pregnancy with daughter Lourdes . Bray decided to cash @-@ in the publicity for the release , although he knew that Madonna would never approve of the album . He said in an interview with Extra that Madonna would receive royalties for the release , and added " There 's nothing in these tapes that would be embarrassing , and just hoping that she would like it as much as we do . " In the European countries , the album was re @-@ titled as In the Beginning , featuring different artwork , and a re @-@ arranged tracklist . 
 Pre @-@ Madonna received mixed reviews from critics . Mark Egan from Rocky Mountain News writes that " although the songs have soul in them , it 's the delivery that lacks in Madonna 's voice ; you just feel that something is really missing . " Mark Zug from Chicago Tribune commented that " the demos on Pre @-@ Madonna are a delight to listen to . To all the Madonna fans , this is one album worth collecting and replaying . " Jasmine Temple from Lexington Herald @-@ Leader calls the album , " a gloriously voyeuristic — and unauthorized — glimpse at Madonna 's past , the woman she was then . You can actually sense the development of the icon she is today from the songs . " Robin DeRosa from USA Today was disappointed with the release , saying that " it feels forced . This release is as unneeded as the hoopla surrounding Madonna 's new born . Every artist has demo recordings in their early phases of career and they are generally not good . This one is not different . " After Madonna was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2008 , Tony Sclafani from MSNBC noted that none of Madonna 's songs were in the rock music genre , " but all use rock as a jumping off point . Audible evidence of Madonna 's rock roots can be found on the collection of early demos Pre @-@ Madonna . "

 = Newcastle town wall = 
 The Newcastle town wall is a medieval defensive wall , and Scheduled Ancient Monument , in Newcastle upon Tyne , England . It was built during the 13th and 14th centuries , and helped protect the town from attack and occupation during times of conflict . It was approximately 3 kilometres ( 2 mi ) long , at least 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 5 ft ) thick , up to 7 @.@ 6 metres ( 25 ft ) high , and had six main gates : Close Gate , West Gate , New Gate , Pilgrim Gate , Pandon Gate and Sand Gate . It also had seventeen towers , as well as several smaller turrets and postern gates . The town wall was kept in good repair whilst there was a threat of invasion from Scottish armies , and the town was successfully defended on at least two occasions ; but with the decline of the border wars between England and Scotland , the wall was allowed to deteriorate . 
 During the English Civil War , the Scots were able to breach the wall using mines and artillery . By the mid @-@ 18th century the wall had become obsolete and , as the town was redeveloped , large sections were demolished leaving only parts standing . The most substantial remains are the West Walls , on the western side of the city . 
 = = Construction = = 
 The town wall was constructed during the 13th and 14th centuries to repel Scottish invaders . Newcastle is about 97 kilometres ( 60 mi ) from the River Tweed , which marks the border between England and Scotland , as it did then . At that time there was a power struggle between England and Scotland , that eventually led to the Wars of Scottish Independence . The Scottish kings were always ready to take advantage of any weakness in the English rule to invade the North of England . An example of this is David I of Scotland , who took advantage of the civil war between Stephen and Matilda to invade Northumberland in three successive years — 1136 – 8 . In the Treaty of Durham ( 1139 ) , David ’ s son Henry was given the earldom of Northumberland . Newcastle was not included in this grant but the Scots ignored this clause and occupied Newcastle until 1157 . Although the town had a strong castle , built by Robert Curthose in 1080 , and improved by Henry II between 1172 and 1177 , it did not provide sufficient protection for the local merchants ' properties , and so it was decided that a fortified town wall was needed . 
 A special tax , or " murage " , was levied by the borough to pay for the construction , <unk> being Latin for wall . It was first levied in 1265 , so it can be assumed that construction began soon after that date . The payment of murage continued for the next hundred years , so construction was probably not finished until at least the mid @-@ 14th century . 
 The plans for the route of the wall changed somewhat during construction . In the original plan , the castle was to be included in the wall as a strongpoint . However the castle was set on high ground above the river bank and there were strong objections to this route , as it would miss out the area by the river where many of the principal burgesses lived , leaving their residences without protection . The route was therefore changed so that the wall turned southward at the Neville Tower and ran down to the river . A similar adjustment to the route was made to the east of the city . In 1299 the village of Pandon was formally incorporated as part of the city , and so the wall made a sharp turn to the east to skirt around Pandon until it reached the river . From Pandon , the wall ran westward along the river , separating the town from the quay . Here , the wall was pierced by a number of water gates that allowed access to the river for loading and unloading of ships . In 1616 it was ordered that these gates were to be closed at night to prevent servants from throwing rubbish into the river . One or two were left open to allow seamen to return to their ships , but these were watched all night . 
 When completed , the wall was approximately 3 kilometres ( 2 mi ) long , at least 2 metres ( 6 @.@ 5 ft ) thick and up to 7 @.@ 6 metres ( 25 ft ) high . It had six main gateways and seventeen towers as well as several smaller turrets and postern gates . The towers projected out from the walls and were within <unk> of each other , so that attackers trying to scale the walls were exposed to fire from both sides ( i.e. , from the towers ) , as well as from the front ( i.e. , from the walls ) . The postern gates were provided for institutions , such as the Dominican Order of Blackfriars and the Hospital of St Mary the Virgin , so that they could access their property outside the walls . Even before the walls were complete , they were supplemented by an outer ditch , known as the King ’ s Dyke . The ditch was over 11 metres ( 36 ft ) wide and 4 @.@ 5 metres ( 15 ft ) deep in front of the Herber and Morden Towers . It was completed by 1317 . 
 = = Subsequent history = = 
 The town wall was kept in good repair whilst there was a threat of invasion from the Scots . In 1342 , David II of Scotland invaded Northumberland and laid siege to Newcastle , without success . In 1388 , another Scottish army under the Earl of Douglas assaulted the town , but was repulsed . As the border wars between England and Scotland became less frequent , and in particular following the union of the two crowns in 1603 , the wall was allowed to deteriorate . 
 In 1640 , during the Bishops ' Wars and in 1644 , during the English Civil War , Scottish armies were able to invade Newcastle despite the presence of the town wall . In 1648 the Parliamentarian governor had the wall repaired . Further repairs were carried out in 1667 . During the Jacobite rebellions of 1715 and 1745 , it was substantially strengthened in preparation for an invading Jacobite army , but there were no attacks on those occasions . A long decline then began , during which the wall was demolished piecemeal to make way for new developments and to create better access to the town centre . The last repairs to the wall were made in the early 19th century , during the Napoleonic Wars . After this it was thought that the town no longer needed a defensive barrier . 
 The first part of the wall to be demolished was the stretch on the quayside , as it was regarded as " a very great obstacle to carriages and a hindrance to the despatch of business " . The quayside section was pulled down in 1763 and the Sand Gate followed in 1798 . 
 = = Gates = = 
 There were six main gateways through the wall , they were ( clockwise from western end ) : 
 Close Gate – This gate was situated at the end of Close , the street that ran west from Sandhill , parallel with the river . In early times , Close was the principal residence of the wealthy traders of the town , and was lined with merchants ’ houses backing on to the river , with their own wharves . It is believed that the town wall ran only a short distance eastwards along the river from the Close Gate . On the north side of the Close Gate was the Whitefriars Tower , and it was the section of wall near there that the Scottish forces under General Leven broke through in the siege of 1644 , after breaching the wall by use of mines and artillery fire . Close Gate was demolished in 1797 . 
 West Gate – This gate led to the West Road which followed the line of the old Roman Wall . It had large oak gates and iron doors , and was described by the antiquary , John Leland , as " a <unk> strong <unk> . " It was , at one time , used as a prison , and later became the hall of the incorporated company of House Carpenters . 17 prisoners were held there during the Civil War , but they managed to escape . It was demolished in 1811 . 
 New Gate – This gate had heavy fortifications , and from 1399 , these were used as the town gaol . Condemned prisoners would be taken from there along Gallowgate to the gallows on the Town Moor . East and west wings were constructed in 1702 and 1706 , respectively ; a north gate was later added . By 1820 , the gaol was considered to be in a poor state of repair and insecure . A new gaol was built in <unk> Square , and the demolition of New Gate began in June 1823 . The east wing was pulled down first , followed by the west wing and the north gate ; the oldest part of the structure remained standing but , despite opposition , it was removed the following September . New Gate is believed to have replaced an earlier gateway known as Berwick Gate . 
 Pilgrim Gate or Pilgrim Street Gate – This gate , at the north end of Pilgrim Street , led out towards Jesmond . Pilgrims would use this gate when travelling to St Mary ’ s Chapel , which was situated overlooking what is now Jesmond Dene . A room above the entrance was used by the Joiners ' Company . It was demolished in 1802 . 
 Pandon Gate – This gate led northeast from the village of Pandon and had folding iron gates , but no portcullis . Until 1648 , it was used as a hall for the Barber <unk> . It was demolished in 1795 . 
 Sand Gate – This gate led to the riverbank to the east of the town . It was demolished in 1798 . 
 Until 1695 the Gates were closed at night . 
 = = The walls today = = 
 Large amounts of the wall were demolished during the 18th and 19th centuries ; the most substantial remains are on the western side of the city . The longest continuous section runs the length of Back Stowell Street , in the Chinatown area . It includes three towers : Herber Tower , Morden Tower and Ever Tower ; since 1964 , Morden Tower has been used as a venue for poetry readings . At the northern end of this section , the wall has been cut through by St Andrew 's Street , with fragmentary remains in St Andrew 's churchyard , opposite ; at the southern end , Stowell Street cuts through onto Bath Lane . The outer ditch has been recreated along this part of the wall . From Stowell Street , a complete section of wall , which includes Durham Tower , stretches southeast along Bath Lane , ending close to Westgate Road . The walls between Westgate Road and St Andrew 's Street are known as the West Walls . Near the river , a partially demolished section of wall is visible on the steep bank between Hanover Street and Close which , between the 1840s and the 1980s , was covered by warehouses . Another substantial portion of the wall stands north of Hanover Street , adjacent to Orchard Street , and the excavated foundations of Gunner Tower can be seen in Pink Lane . On the eastern side of the city stand three towers : Plummer Tower in Croft Street , Corner Tower at the junction of City Road and Melbourne Street , and <unk> Tower in Tower Street . Plummer Tower was modified by the Company of Cutlers in the 17th century , and the Company of Masons , who added an upper storey and a new western facade , in the 18th century . <unk> Tower was altered by the addition of a banqueting hall on the first floor in 1716 which was used by the Shipwrights ' Company . The walls are a Scheduled Ancient Monument . 
 = In Our Time ( short story collection ) = 
 In Our Time is Ernest Hemingway 's first collection of short stories , published in 1925 by Boni & Liveright , New York . Its title is derived from the English Book of Common Prayer , " Give us peace in our time , O Lord " . The collection 's publication history was complex . It began with six prose vignettes commissioned by Ezra Pound for a 1923 edition of The Little Review . Hemingway added twelve more and in 1924 compiled the in our time edition ( with lower @-@ case title ) , which was printed in Paris . To these were added fourteen short stories for the 1925 edition , including " Indian Camp " and " Big Two @-@ Hearted River " , two of his best @-@ known Nick Adams stories . He composed " On the Quai at Smyrna " for the 1930 edition . 
 The stories ' themes – of alienation , loss , grief , separation – continue the work Hemingway began with the vignettes , which include descriptions of acts of war , bullfighting and current events . The collection is known for its spare language and oblique depiction of emotion , through a style known as Hemingway 's " theory of omission " ( Iceberg Theory ) . According to his biographer Michael Reynolds , among Hemingway 's canon , " none is more confusing … for its several parts – biographical , literary , editorial , and bibliographical – contain so many contradictions that any analysis will be flawed . " 
 = = Background and publication history = = 
 Hemingway was 19 years old when , in 1918 , shortly after he was posted to the Italian Front as a Red Cross ambulance driver , he sustained a severe wound from mortar fire . For the next six months he recuperated in a Milan hospital , where he fell in love with nurse Agnes von Kurowsky . Shortly after his return to the US , she informed him that she was engaged to an Italian officer . Soon after he turned to journalism . 
 A few months after marrying Hadley Richardson in 1921 , he was posted to Paris as international correspondent for The Toronto Star , reporting on the Greco @-@ Turkish War and sporting events in Spain and Germany . In Paris he befriended Gertrude Stein , Ezra Pound , F. Scott Fitzgerald , James Joyce , Ford Madox Ford , and John Dos Passos , establishing a particularly strong friendship with Pound . Pound 's influence extended to promoting the young author , placing six of Hemingway 's poems in Poetry Magazine . In August he asked Hemingway to contribute a small volume to the modernist series he was editing , and Bill Bird was publishing for his Three Mountains Press , which Pound envisioned as the " Inquest into the state of the modern English language " . Pound 's commission turned Hemingway 's attention toward fiction , and had profound consequences on his development as a writer . 
 On December 2 , 1922 , nearly all of Hemingway 's early writing – his juvenilia and apprentice fiction , including the duplicates – was lost . He had been sent on assignment to cover the Conference of Lausanne , leaving Hadley , who was sick with a cold , behind in Paris . In Lausanne , he spent the days covering the conference , and the evenings drinking with Lincoln Steffens . Before setting off to meet him in Switzerland , thinking he would want to show his work to Steffens , Hadley packed all his manuscripts into a valise which was subsequently stolen at Gare de Lyon train station . Although angry and upset , Hemingway went with Hadley to <unk> ( Montreux ) to ski , and apparently did not post a reward for the recovery of the valise . An early story , " Up in Michigan " , survived the loss because Gertrude Stein had told him it was unprintable ( in part because of a seduction scene ) , and he had stuffed it in a drawer . 
 A month later in a letter to Pound he mentioned that " You , naturally , would say , " Good " etc . But don 't say it to me . I ain 't reached that mood . " In his reply Pound pointed out that Hemingway had only lost " the time it will ... take you to rewrite the parts you can remember ... If the middle , i.e. , <unk> , of the story is right then one ought to be able to reassemble it from memory ... If the thing wobbles and won 't reform ... then it never <unk> have been right . " Critics are uncertain whether he took Pound 's advice and re @-@ created existing stories or whether everything he wrote after the loss of the suitcase was new . 
 = = = " Little Review " = = = 
 In February 1923 , Hemingway and Hadley visited Italy ; in Rapallo they met Pound , who almost certainly commissioned the prose pieces for the literary magazine The Little Review during their visit . Still upset at the loss of his work , Hemingway had not written since the previous December , but he slowly wrote six new paragraphs , submitting them for the March deadline . Hemingway scholar Milton Cohen says at that point Hemingway knew the pieces for The Little Review would " govern the remainder of the book that Pound had commissioned . " 
 The six prose pieces ranged from 75 to 187 words and were about war and bullfighting . The battle scenes came from the experiences of Hemingway 's friend Chink Dorman @-@ Smith who was at the Battle of Mons ; the matador story originated from another friend , Mike <unk> . Hemingway himself witnessed the events which inspired the story about the Greco @-@ Turkish War . The last of the series was taken from news of the execution of six Greek cabinet ministers during the Trial of the Six . 
 The Little Review 's " Exiles " edition , scheduled to be published in the spring , was finally released in October 1923 , leading with Hemingway 's work . It featured pieces from modernists such as Gertrude Stein , George Antheil , E. E. Cummings and Jean Cocteau . Hemingway 's vignettes were titled " In Our Time " , suggesting a cohesive set . 
 = = = in our time = = = 
 In June 1923 , Hemingway took Hadley , with Robert McAlmon and Bird , to Spain where he found a new passion with his first visits to the bullfights . During the summer he wrote five new vignettes ( chapters 12 – 16 ) , all about bullfighting , finishing the last two on his return to Paris in August . That summer he also honed new narrative techniques in chapters 7 – 11 . In August he reported to Pound that he was about to begin the last two pieces ( chapters 17 and 18 ) , implemented revisions that Pound suggested , and sent the manuscript to Bill Bird . Then he left Paris with Hadley ( who was pregnant with their first child ) for Toronto , where he was living when Bird finished producing the book . 
 The pieces he submitted to Bird were at first untitled ( Pound called the submission Blank ) ; later the title in our time – from the Book of Common Prayer – was chosen . Bird printed the volume on a hand @-@ press with handmade paper , telling Hemingway , " I 'm going to pull something really fancy with your book " . The book contained eighteen vignettes and only thirty @-@ one pages ; each one was laid out with plenty of white space , highlighting the brevity of the prose . According to Cohen , the " visual suddenness intensifies its narrative abruptness , heightens the shock of violence , and the chillingly matter @-@ of @-@ fact tone " . The book 's presentation was intended as unconventional , with its use of lowercase throughout and lack of quotation marks . When challenged by American editors over the use of lowercase in the titles , Hemingway admitted that it could be seen as " silly and affected " . 
 Bird designed the distinctive dust @-@ jacket – a collage of newspaper articles in four languages – to highlight that the vignettes carried a sense of journalism or news . The frontispiece is a woodcut portrait of the author , which during the printing process bled through to the next page , ruining more than half the print run so that only 170 of the 300 copies printed were deemed suitable to sell . The rest were sent to reviewers and friends .

 A year later Hemingway was back in Paris , where he wrote some of his best short stories and told Scott Fitzgerald that , of the new material , " Indian Camp " and " Big Two @-@ Hearted River " were superior . Over the next six months , one of his most productive periods according to critic Jackson Benson , he wrote eight short stories . The stories were combined with the earlier vignettes and sent to Boni & Liveright in New York toward the end of the year . In March he was in Schruns , Austria when the acceptance cable and $ 100 advance arrived , with a request to option his next two books . Directly afterward , he received a letter from Max Perkins of Scribner 's , who had read Bird 's Paris edition and thought it lacked commercial appeal , and queried whether the young writer had stories to offer to bolster the collection . In his reply , Hemingway explained he had already entered a contract with Boni & Liveright . When he received the contract for the book , Boni & Liveright requested " Up in Michigan " be dropped for fear it might be censored ; in response Hemingway wrote " The Battler " to replace the earlier story . 
 The 1925 New York edition contained the fourteen short stories with the vignettes interwoven as " interchapters " . Boni & Liveright published the book on October 5 , 1925 , with a print @-@ run of 1335 copies , costing $ 2 each , which saw four reprints . The firm designed a " modish " dust @-@ jacket , similar to the Paris edition , and elicited endorsements from Ford Madox Ford , Gilbert Seldes , John Dos Passos , and Donald Ogden Stewart . Boni & Liveright claimed American copyright for the works published in France . 
 Hemingway was disappointed with the publisher 's marketing efforts , and that December he complained to Boni & Liveright about their handling of the book , citing a lack of advertising , claiming they could have had " 20 @,@ 000 in sales " and that he should have requested a $ 1000 advance . He later broke his contract with the firm , signing with Max Perkins at Scribner 's the following year . Scribner 's bought the rights from Boni & Liveright , releasing the second American edition on October 24 , 1930 , which saw one reprint . The Scribner 's edition included an introduction by Edmund Wilson and Hemingway 's " Introduction by the Author " , which was renamed as " On the Quai at Smyrna " in the 1938 publication of The Fifth Column and the First Forty @-@ Nine Stories . When In Our Time was re @-@ issued in 1955 , " On the Quai at Smyrna " replaced " Indian Camp " as the first story .

 The 1924 in our time collection consists of eighteen vignettes . Five center on World War I ( Chapters 1 , 4 , 5 , 7 , 8 ) ; six on bullfighting ( Chapters 2 and 12 to 16 ) ; the others around news stories . Chapter 10 is the longest . It details a soldier 's affair with a Red Cross nurse , and is based on Hemingway 's relationship with Agnes von Kurowsky . The piece about a robbery and murder in Kansas City originated in a newspaper story Hemingway covered as a cub reporter at the Kansas City Star ; it is followed by the story of the public hanging of the Chicago mobster Sam <unk> . The last , " L <unk> " , is about the King of Greece and Sophia of Prussia giving an interview in the palace garden during the Revolution . 
 = = = 1925 edition = = = 
 The 1925 New York edition begins with the short stories " Indian Camp " and " The Doctor and the Doctor 's Wife " . The two are linked thematically ; they are set in Michigan and introduce Nick Adams . Nick witnesses an emergency caesarean section and a suicide in the first ; tension between his parents in the second . The next story , " The End of Something " , is also set in Michigan , and details Nick 's break @-@ up with his girlfriend ; " The Three @-@ Day Blow " follows , where Nick and a friend get drunk . " The Battler " is about Nick 's chance encounter with a prize @-@ fighter . " A Very Short Story " , which was the longest vignette in the previous edition , comes next and is followed by " Soldier 's Home " , set in Oklahoma , and " The Revolutionist " , set in Italy . The next three are set in Europe and detail unhappy marriages : " Mr. and Mrs. Elliot " , " Cat in the Rain " and " Out of Season " . They are placed before Nick 's reappearance in " Cross Country Snow " , which takes place in Switzerland . The penultimate " My Old Man " concerns horse @-@ racing in Italy and Paris , and the volume ends with the two @-@ part Nick Adams story " Big Two @-@ Hearted River " , set in Michigan . The vignettes were re @-@ ordered and placed between the short stories as interchapters . 
 = = Structure = = 
 Whether the collection has a unified structure has been a source of debate among Hemingway critics . According to Reynolds the collection should be " read as a predictable step in any young author 's career " and the pieces considered as " discrete units " . Yet he admits that Hemingway 's remarks , and the complexity of the structure , suggests the stories and vignettes were meant to be an interconnected whole . In a letter to Pound in August 1923 , Hemingway told him he had finished the full set of eighteen vignettes , saying of them , " When they are read together , they all hook up ... The bulls start , then reappear , then finish off . The war starts clear and noble just like it did ... gets close and blurred and finished with the <unk> who goes home and gets clap . " He went on to say of " in our time " , " ... it has form all right " . On October 18 , 1924 he wrote to Edmund Wilson , " Finished the book of 14 stories with a chapter of ' In Our Time ' between each story – that is the way they are meant to go – to give the picture of the whole before examining it in detail " . 
 Benson notes that all the fiction Hemingway had produced was included in the collection , that the connection between stories and vignettes is tenuous at best , and that Pound had an influence in editing the final product . Benson calls the work a " prose poem of terror " , where looking for connections is meaningless . Conversely , Linda Wagner @-@ Martin suggests the unrelenting tone of horror and somber mood unify the separate pieces . One of its early reviewers , D. H. Lawrence , referred to it as a " fragmentary novel " . 
 Hemingway scholar <unk> Tetlow says that from its inception the collection was written with a rhythmic and lyrical unity reminiscent of Pound 's " Hugh Selwyn Mauberley " and Eliot 's The Waste Land . The carefully crafted sequence continues in the 1925 edition , beginning with the first five Nick Adams stories , which are about violence and doom , empty relationships and characters lacking self @-@ awareness . The first two stories , " Indian Camp " and " The Doctor and the Doctor 's Wife " , can be read as an exercise in counterpoint , where feelings of loss , anger , and evil are ignored and repressed . " The End of Something " and " The Three @-@ Day Blow " also form a pair ; in the first Nick breaks up with his girlfriend , in the second he gets drunk and denies the relationship has ended , convincing himself that it will all work out . This state of denial continues in " The Battler " , the fifth story ; when faced with violence Nick will not recognize that he is in danger . " A Very Short Story " , about betrayal , and wounding , ends the sequence according to Tetlow , who suggests these are stories in which Hemingway writes about the " most bitter feelings of loss and disillusionment " . The characters face loss with inner strength , stoicism and a sense of acceptance ; they build strength in the stories that come after , gaining self @-@ awareness as they accept the futility and pain of life . The collection ends with " Big Two @-@ Hearted River " , in which Nick finds tranquility , perhaps even happiness , in solitude . Wagner @-@ Martin notes that " it is this essential tranquility that in retrospect heightens the tension and sorrow of the preceding pieces . " 
 Another Hemingway scholar , Jim <unk> , disagrees with Tetlow , writing that its only unity consists of similarities in tone and style and the recurrence of the Nick Adams character . Although the first vignettes share a common thread about the war , each is distinctly framed , weakening any structural unity that might have existed . He blames the war , saying that it was too hard for Hemingway to write about it cohesively , that it was " too large , terrible , and mentally overwhelming to grasp in its entirety " . Instead , he says , Hemingway wrote fragments , " discrete glimpses into hell ... like the wreckage of battle lit up from a shell burst at night . " The structure apparent in the 1924 collection of vignettes is lost in the later edition , because the short stories seem to bear little if any relationship to the interchapters , shattering the carefully constructed order . The sense of discordance is intensified because the action is about unnamed men and soldiers , only referred to with pronouns , and unspecified <unk> . The characters are transformed through circumstances and settings , where danger exists overtly , on the battlefield , or , in one case , by a chance sexual encounter in a Chicago taxi . 
 Critic E. R. Hageman notes the 1924 in our time vignettes are linked chronologically , spanning ten years from 1914 to 1923 , and the choices were deliberate . World War I and the aftermath was " the experience of his generation , the experience that dumped his peers and his elders into graves , shell @-@ holes , hospitals , and onto gallows . These were ' in our time ' , Hemingway is saying , and he remarks the significant and the insignificant . " 
 = = Themes = = 
 The stories contain themes Hemingway was to revisit over the course of his career . He wrote about initiation rites , early love , marriage problems , disappointment in family life and the importance of male comradeship . The collection conjures a world of violence and war , suffering , executions ; it is a world stripped of romance , where even " the hero of the bullfight chapter pukes " . Hemingway 's early @-@ 20th century is a time " out of season " , where war , death , and tangled , unfulfilling relationships reign . Alienation in the modern world is particularly evident in " Out of Season " , which bears similarities to Eliot 's The Waste Land . Eliot 's Waste Land motif exists throughout much of Hemingway 's early fiction , but is most notable in this collection , The Sun Also Rises ( 1926 ) , and the 1929 A Farewell to Arms . He borrowed Eliot 's device of using imagery to evoke feeling . Benson attributes similarities between Hemingway and Eliot to Pound , who edited both . 
 Motifs and themes reappear , the most obvious being the juxtaposition of life and death . There are some recurring images such as water and darkness – places of safety . Benson notes how , after reading the first few vignettes and stories , readers " realize we are in hell . " Hemingway conjures a world where " the weak are <unk> exploited by the strong , and ... all functions of life ... promise only pain . " 
 Hemingway 's semi @-@ autobiographical character Nick Adams is " vital to Hemingway 's career " , writes Mellow , and generally his character reflects Hemingway 's experiences . Nick , who features in eight of the stories , is an alter ego , a means for Hemingway to express his own experiences , from the first story ' " Indian Camp " which features Nick as a child . According to critic Howard Hannum the trauma of birth and suicide Hemingway paints in " Indian Camp " rendered a leitmotif that gave Hemingway a unified framework for the Nick Adams stories . It is followed by " The Doctor and the Doctor 's Wife " , which Mellows says is written with a sense of " hostility and resignation " , and sheds a rare light on Hemingway 's childhood . In the story , 12 @-@ year @-@ old Nick hides from his angry and violent father ; the mother , a Christian Scientist , is distanced , withdrawn in her bedroom , reading Science and Health . 
 " Big Two @-@ Hearted River " , the concluding and climactic piece , details Nick 's return from war . In it Nick knows he has left his needs behind ; Debra <unk> highlights how all of the Nick storylines , and most of the others in the collection , are about a " flight from pain " . She believes that Gertrude Stein 's definition of the Lost Generation applies to In Our Time as much , if not more so , as to The Sun Also Rises ; that " Nick seems to believe that the things most worth having and caring about – life , love , ideals , companions , peace , freedom – will be lost sooner or later , and he is not sure how to cope with this assurance , except through irony , bitterness , and , sometimes , wishful thinking . " In the last story he learns to come to terms with the loss of his friends , and acknowledges " all the loss he has experienced in the last few years and , equally important , the loss he has come to expect . " 
 = = Style = = 
 Biographer Mellow believes that In Our Time is Hemingway 's most experimental book , particularly with its unusual narrative form . The vignettes have no traditional sense of narrative ; they begin in the middle . Shifting points @-@ of @-@ view and narrative perspectives disguise autobiographical details . 
 Pound taught Hemingway to write sparingly . Pound wrote to him that " anything put on top of the subject is BAD ... The subject is always interesting enough without blankets . " Hemingway would write in A Moveable Feast ( published posthumously in 1964 ) , " If I started to write elaborately , like someone presenting or introducing something , I found that I could cut that scrollwork or ornament out and throw it away and start with the first true simple declarative sentence I had written . " In Our Time was written during the author 's experimentation phase , his first attempts towards a minimalist style . The prose in " Indian Camp " and " Big Two @-@ Hearted River " is sharper and more abstract than in other stories , and by employing simple sentences and diction – techniques he learned writing for newspapers – the prose is timeless with an almost mythic quality , explains Benson . The tightly compressed sentence structure emulates and reflects Pound 's imagist style , bringing to prose narrative the stripped @-@ down style Pound famously established in 1913 with poems such as " In a Station of the Metro " . Thomas Strychacz compares Hemingway 's prose to Pound 's poetry , writing " Hemingway 's terse , tight @-@ lipped , tightly wound fragments are equally extraordinary in their dramatic intensity . " 
 The taut style is apparent from the first vignette , in which a brigade of drunken soldiers march to Champagne . With supreme understatement he alludes to the Second Battle of Champagne , an offensive lasting from September to December 25 , 1915 , in which 120 @,@ 000 French troops were killed in the first three weeks : 
 The vignette opening with the words " We were in a garden at Mons " is equally understated ; the narrator writes , " The first German I saw climbed up over the garden wall . We waited till he got one leg over then potted him . He ... looked awfully surprised " . The description repeats images , is dispassionate and warps logic , according to Strychacz . 
 These set the model for flash fiction – fiction that is condensed without unnecessary descriptive detail . In A Moveable Feast Hemingway wrote that " Out of Season " , written in 1924 , was the first story where he applied the theory of omission , known as his Iceberg Theory . He explained that the stories in which he left out the most important parts , such as not writing about the war in " Big Two @-@ Hearted River " , are the best of his early fiction . As Carlos Baker describes the technique , the hard facts float above water while the supporting structure , including the symbolism , operates out of sight , which Hemingway articulated in 1930 in Death in the Afternoon , in his explanation that a writer can omit his own knowledge from a story . 
 = = Reception and legacy = = 
 Hemingway 's writing style attracted attention after the release of the Parisian edition of in our time in 1924 . Edmund Wilson described the writing as " of the first <unk> " , writing that the bullfight scenes were like Francisco Goya paintings , that the author " had almost invented a form of his own " , and it had " more artistic dignity than any written by an American about the period of the war . " 
 The 1925 edition of In Our Time is considered one of Hemingway 's masterpieces . Reviewers and critics noticed , and the collection received positive reviews on its publication . The New York Times described the language as " fibrous and athletic , colloquial and fresh , hard and clean , his very prose seems to have an organic being of its own " . A reviewer for Time wrote , " Ernest Hemingway is somebody ; a new honest un- ' literary ' transcriber of life – a Writer . " Reviewing if for The Bookman , F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote Hemingway was an " augury " of the age and that the Nick Adams stories were " temperamentally new " in American fiction . 
 His parents , however , described the book as " filth " , disturbed by the passage in " A Very Short Story " which tells of a soldier contracting gonorrhea after a sexual encounter with a sales girl in a taxicab . Bird sent five copies to them which were promptly returned , eliciting a letter from Hemingway , who complained , " I wonder what was the matter , whether the pictures were too accurate and the attitude toward life not sufficiently distorted to please who ever bought the book or what ? " 
 In Our Time was ignored and forgotten by literary critics for decades . Benson attributes the neglect to various factors . The Sun Also Rises , published the next year , is considered the more important book followed fairly rapidly by the popular A Farewell to Arms two years after in 1928 ; critics ' general assumption seemed to be that Hemingway 's talent lay in writing prose rather than " sophisticated , complex design " ; and In Our Time stories were combined with subsequent collections in the publication of The Fifth Column and the First Forty @-@ Nine Stories in 1938 , drawing the critics ' attention away from the book as an entity , toward the individual stories . In 1962 , when Scribner 's released the paperback edition of In Our Time , it began to be taught in American universities , and by the end of the decade the first critical study of the collection appeared . Benson describes the collection as the author 's first " major achievement " ; Wagner @-@ Martin as " his most striking work , both in terms of personal involvement and technical innovation . " 
 = Company Picnic = 
 " Company Picnic " is the fifth season finale of the American comedy television series The Office , and the 100th overall episode of the series . It originally aired on NBC in the United States on May 14 , 2009 . In the episode , Michael plans to win back his ex @-@ girlfriend Holly at a Dunder Mifflin company picnic , while the rest of the Scranton office get involved in a competitive company volleyball tournament . 
 The episode was written by Paul Lieberstein and Jennifer Celotta , and directed by Ken Kwapis . It marked return appearances of former guest stars Amy Ryan as Holly Flax and Idris Elba as Charles Miner . Actress Jenna Fischer is not as talented a volleyball player as she is portrayed in the episode , so some of her scenes were modified with computer @-@ generated imagery . 
 The scene in which Jim and Pam discover the pregnancy includes no dialogue , and is a homage to a similar scene in the original British version of The Office , where Tim Canterbury silently proclaims his love for Dawn Tinsley . The episode also features a sketch about the history of Dunder Mifflin which parodies the film Slumdog Millionaire . 
 " Company Picnic " received generally positive reviews , particularly for the return of Holly and the scene in which Jim discovers Pam is pregnant . According to Nielsen ratings , the episode was watched by 6 @.@ 72 million viewers . It was the lowest @-@ rated episode of the season and had the lowest original episode rating for The Office in two years , which reviewers said was especially surprising given that it was a season finale episode . 
 = = Synopsis = = 
 Employees arrive at a Dunder Mifflin company picnic , where Michael ( Steve Carell ) plans to win back his ex @-@ girlfriend Holly ( Amy Ryan ) , whom he has not seen since she was transferred to Nashua . Holly arrives with her boyfriend A. J. ( Rob Huebel ) , who tells Michael the couple are designing a house together . CFO David Wallace ( Andy Buckley ) allows Michael and Holly to do a presentation about the history of Dunder Mifflin , and the two spend time in the woods to come up with ideas . Jim ( John Krasinski ) and Pam ( Jenna Fischer ) run into Charles Miner ( Idris Elba ) for the first time since he left Scranton , and Charles is still short with Jim . Dwight ( Rainn Wilson ) brings his new best friend , Rolf ( James Urbaniak ) , who makes constant insults to Angela ( Angela Kinsey ) for breaking Dwight 's heart ; Dwight tells Rolf to stop , much to Angela 's surprise . The Scranton branch competes in the picnic 's volleyball tournament , facing off the other branches of Dunder Mifflin . They initially struggle until Pam reveals herself to be a very talented volleyball player . With her help , they reach the final round where they face the corporate head office . 
 Michael and Holly perform a skit that parodies Slumdog Millionaire ( called " SlumDunder Mifflinaire " ) , presenting Dunder Mifflin trivia in the form of Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ? , as well as acting out torture scenes featured in the film . Nobody , except Stanley ( Leslie David Baker ) , finds their presentation amusing , but things take a turn for the worse when they reveal that the Buffalo branch , whose staff are hearing this announcement for the first time , will be closing in the near future because of the economic recession . After reluctantly confirming this news to the Buffalo staff , David berates Michael for revealing this as it was something David told to Michael in confidence . In his own defense , Michael insists he thought they already knew about it . As Michael and Holly talk about next year 's presentation , he prepares to ask for her back but stops himself , deciding not to ruin the moment . As Holly leaves with A. J. , Michael says he believes he will eventually be reunited with Holly , although potentially not for a long time — and he 's fine with this because " I 'm in no rush " . 
 The Scranton branch faces off against the corporate branch , commenting that they deserve to lose for deciding to close down Buffalo . The game is close , and Pam ends up injuring her ankle , although she wants to continue . Seeing an opportunity to remove Scranton 's best player from the game , Charles insists that Pam take a seat on the grounds of her injury being a company liability . Determined to beat corporate , Jim takes Pam to a local hospital to get an X @-@ ray while Dwight stalls the game to give them time to get back . When the doctor calls Jim into the room for an update , the doctor informs Jim and Pam of some news that causes them to be ecstatic , presumably that Pam is pregnant . Jim then calls Dwight to send in the substitute players .

 The episode was written by Paul Lieberstein and Jennifer Celotta , and directed by Ken Kwapis . " Company Picnic " was the 100th overall episode of The Office , and show creator Greg Daniels said he was especially proud the series made it to that landmark because he felt it meant he did not disappoint Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant , who created the original British version of the show . Daniels said , " I remember interviewing with them seven years ago , and this ( 100th episode ) was certainly the goal , so I 'm very pleased that we got to 100 episodes in a strong fashion . I think the show is in a very good place right now . " Steve Carell said he was especially pleased with the landmark because when the show began , people had doubts it would live up to the original series and were skeptical about its mockumentary style : " It 's sort of remarkable , especially with this show because I don 't think anybody felt it would go past the pilot . ... I think most everyone was kind of dubious about our chances of pulling it off . " Likewise , Ben Silverman , co @-@ chairman of NBC Entertainment and an Office executive producer , said , " It 's a thrill that we got to 100 episodes , and probably incredibly surprising looking back at the process it took . But the reality is , we believed in it . " 
 " Company Picnic " was filmed in Malibu , California . The episode featured about 360 extras , and was shot over the course of four days . Actor Ed Helms said of the episode , " What the writers did is really fun and creative . It doesn 't boil down to passive aggressive little picnic games with a vengeance . There 's a lot more going on than that . " The episode marked return appearances of former guest stars Amy Ryan as Holly Flax and Idris Elba as Charles Miner . Ryan said she would love the prospect of returning to The Office in future episodes , but that there are currently no plans for such a return : " I think that door [ to return ] will always be open , just because it 's such a nice party to go to . But that said , there are no plans any time soon for them to be reunited again . " 
 In an interview with The Office fansite " OfficeTally " , Celotta said she and Lieberstein had only about one weekend to finish the script and distribute it to the actors , so there was little discussion about their individual volleyball abilities . Once the scripts were circulated , the writers learned that Jenna Fischer was not very good at volleyball and had trouble making certain motions with her arm over her head due to a previous injury . As a result , director Ken Kwapis arranged for stunt doubles to perform some of the volleyball moves ; a handful of scenes were also shot with Pam doing an overhead motion with the ball being added later using computer @-@ generated imagery . The opening credits were trimmed down to ten seconds and no post @-@ credits scene was used in order to keep the episode within the network @-@ mandated 21 minutes and 35 seconds . The producers considered making the episode an hour long like other season finales from past seasons , like " The Job " and " Goodbye , Toby " , but they found they did not have enough plot points to conclude in " Company Picnic " and would have had trouble filling a full hour . 
 Precautions were taken to prevent secrets from the season finale being revealed ; only certain staff members were provided with copies of the episode , which were given on watermarked DVDs and distributed to secret hiding places . The writers wanted Michael to have a big plan to get Holly back , but to realize throughout the course of the day that his relationship with Holly was something special and that he did not want to disrupt it ; they felt it showed that Michael had become more mature , calm and confident about this relationship than that of Jan Levenson and others in his past . The first scene with Michael and Holly discussing their sketch possibilities in a secluded area was filmed with three cameras : one focusing on each side of the two actors , and one from the front of both of them to establish that the picnic was still going on behind them . Due to space limitations , the latter angle was filmed through a mirror ( with the actors appearing to be opposite sides ) and then the image was reversed and undistorted in post @-@ production . 
 Although the " SlumDunder Mifflinaire " skit and the scenes in which it was prepared were all scripted , Carell and Ryan improvised several of the moments including Michael 's " Yay ! " cheer upon getting an answer right , the bow Carell and Ryan take at the end while the Buffalo branch employees are angry , and Michael 's Indian accent . Carell improvised with several different accents on the set , with the producers settling on the one that sounded most like the character from the film , although he used his regular accent when answering the final question in the skit . Carell and Ryan also made up the Jaws song parody ( " Dunder ... Dunder ... " ) while filming , and Carell made up the subsequent line " We 're circling it " about their good sketch idea . The extras were told not to laugh or react at all to the " SlumDunder Mifflinaire " sketch , but Carell and Ryan were not told of those instructions in order to create a genuine stage fright awkwardness among the two actors ; Ryan in particular was thrown off guard by their lack of response . 
 The ending sequence with Pam and Jim in the hospital was filmed at the North Hollywood Medical Center using the Sacred Heart Hospital set from Scrubs . Although the good news Jim and Pam learn in the hospital was never specifically stated , episode writer Jen Celotta confirmed that the news was that Pam was pregnant ; the script included an off @-@ hand question from a nurse to Pam about whether she was pregnant so that viewers would make the connection later . Celotta said the idea of the pregnancy came as the writers were working on this specific episode , although she felt the show had always been heading in that direction . The series producers considered filming the scene with audible dialogue , but they thought the scene was more powerful without audio and felt actors John Krasinski and Jenna Fischer " are such great actors and have the ability to convey so much without hearing their dialogue . " Celotta said the show 's producers have no plans to release the scene with audio . While filming Jim Halpert 's emotional reaction to the pregnancy news , Krasinski and director Ken Kwapis discussed the fact that Jim has been surrounded by this camera crew for the last five years , so he would be glad to share this moment with them . The moment when Jim looked directly at the camera , in particular , was meant to convey the idea that he was celebrating the news with the crew . The script did not call for tears , but Krasinski cried naturally as part of his performance . 
 Lieberstein and Celotta originally planned to have Mose Schrute , Dwight 's cousin and a popular minor character , appear in the episode along with Dwight , but actor Michael Schur was unable to attend because he was busy directing " Rock Show " , the first season finale of the NBC series Parks and Recreation , which Schur co @-@ created along with The Office creator Greg Daniels . Instead , the writers created the role of Rolph , and several of the actors suggested James Urbaniak be cast in the role . Celotta said she intends to have both Urbaniak and Schur come back to the show in future episodes ; she said of Schur , " Who knew Mose would run a show some day ? We 'll get him one of these days , rest assured . " Jennie Tan , the creator of The Office fansite OfficeTally.com , appeared as an extra during the picnic scenes ; her site has grown so large she has become known by the cast and crew of the show , who invited her to appear on the season finale . Brian Stack , a writer and actor on Late Night with Conan O 'Brien and The Tonight Show with Conan O 'Brien , had a small role as the Buffalo branch employee who yells angrily at David Wallace . The Office editor Dave Rogers makes a cameo appearance as the volleyball player who tells Andy he is wearing expensive sunglasses . After filming wrapped , the cast and crew held a 100th episode party , where Dave Rogers presented a montage of " 100 Moments " of The Office , with one moment from each episode . 
 When the Pam character discusses her impressive volleyball ability , she says she played volleyball in junior high , senior high , college and went to volleyball camps most summers . However , in the episode " Job Fair " , she said her high school gym brings back memories of her faking PMS to get out of playing basketball and volleyball . Writer Jen Celotta acknowledged this was a continuity error : " Yeah , we screwed up . I didn 't remember that she said that , specifically about volleyball . And we really do try to be careful about those things . " 
 The official website for The Office included three cut scenes from " Company Picnic " within a week of its original release . The first clip , one minute and fifty seconds long , is an extended sequence of company picnic scenes , including Michael talking about how excited he is to see Holly , Stanley convincing Creed to stand in his sunlight to provide shade , and Dwight and Andy mocking the Utica team by calling them " You @-@ sucks @-@ ti @-@ ca ! " The clip also featured a brief appearance of Meredith 's son Jake , played by Spencer Daniels , who has not appeared in the show since the second season episode , " Take Your Daughter to Work Day " ; after he rudely and pointedly addresses her by her first name , Meredith orders him to spend the picnic locked in their car . In the second one @-@ minute long deleted scene clip , Andy yells at his volleyball teammates when they make a mistake , a Buffalo branch player snaps at his own team , and Charles makes fun of Jim from the sidelines . In the third 30 @-@ second clip , Dwight bullies and pesters everyone about the final point of the volleyball game against corporate , prompting Meredith to throw the game by throwing the ball at Dwight during her serve .

 The " SlumDunder Mifflinaire " sketch is a reference to the 2008 film Slumdog Millionaire ; references to the film included the game show Who Wants to Be a Millionaire , the torture scenes intercut with the game show and Carell 's impersonation of Slumdog actor Dev Patel 's voice . Before settling on Slumdog Millionaire , Michael and Holly considered writing Dunder Mifflin @-@ themed parodies of the 1975 Steven Spielberg film Jaws and the 1985 science fiction adventure film Back to the Future . While discussing the Jaws idea , they hum John Williams ' Jaws " Main Title " song , substituting the famous two @-@ note theme with the words " Dunder ... Dunder ... " During the sketch , Michael and Holly announce the closing of a Dunder Mifflin branch in Buffalo , the second largest city in the state of New York . Alan Pergament of The Buffalo News said of the city 's inclusion in the episode , " It ruined the party for the Buffalo workers but made the episode a lot of fun , especially for Buffalo viewers . " Holly and A.J. come from the Dunder Mifflin branch in Nashua , New Hampshire . 
 Michael compared his relationship to Holly to that of the protagonists in the 1989 romantic comedy , When Harry Met Sally .... " Company Picnic " writer Jennifer Celotta said the final scene with Jim and Pam reacting to her pregnancy while the cameras film from outside the hospital room was an homage to a scene in the British version of The Office . In that scene , Tim Canterbury proclaims his love for Dawn Tinsley in a meeting room , but Tim turns off his microphone first so the cameras pick up only their reactions and no sound . Celotta said of the scene , " We are all big fans of the moment that Tim takes off his mic and tells Dawn how he feels . Such an intimate moment that , to me , it feels like it 's nice to have it just be theirs . "

 In its original American broadcast on May 14 , 2009 , " Company Picnic " was watched by 6 @.@ 72 million viewers , according to Nielsen ratings . It was the lowest original episode rating for The Office in two years , a fact commentators said was especially surprising given that the episode was a season finale . The rating was a 13 percent drop in viewership from the previous week 's episode , " Cafe Disco " , which was seen by 7 @.@ 71 million viewers . It also unseated " Casual Friday " , which was seen by 7 @.@ 3 million viewers , as the lowest @-@ rated episode of the fifth season . " Company Picnic " received a 3 @.@ 9 rating / 12 share among viewers aged between 18 and 34 , and a 3 @.@ 5 rating / 9 share among viewers between 18 and 49 . 
 Alan Sepinwall of The Star @-@ Ledger described the episode as " a great end to what may have been my favorite season of The Office to date . " He said the episode included great laughs and sublime dramatic moments , including Michael 's moment with Holly after the sketch and the silent moment in which Jim learns Pam is pregnant . Sepinwall said Jim 's moment of composing himself in the hallway after calling Dwight in that scene was , " Maybe Krasinski 's single best moment on the series to date . " Margaret Lyons of Entertainment Weekly said she had " some mixed feelings " about the episode and wished it had more from Ryan , Creed and Kelly , but she especially praised the ending scene with Jim and Pam , which she said she did not expect . Dan Hooper of VH1 's Best Week Ever said , " Office finale was awesome , as we expected , capping about seven straight weeks of just top @-@ notch episodes with great character moments , a legitimately interesting plot , and just laugh line after laugh line , reminding us all ( why ) we spent time talking about this show every week . " Hooper also praised NBC for not advertising the twist ending : " They didn ’ t stupidly dramatize it , and it ended up being a really nice , really fitting end " to the season . 
 <unk> Rabin of The A.V. Club , who gave the episode a B + grade , said it was " long on pathos and awkwardness but short on laughs " , but described it as " a very satisfying way to end a very satisfying season " . Although Rabin said the final scene with Jim and Pam was filmed and handled artfully , he also expressed concern that the subplot could turn into a cliched device , and said " part of me felt it was a rather pat , heavy @-@ handed way of ending the season on a dramatic note . " Will Leitch of New York magazine expressed concern about the dangers of television shows adding a pregnancy subplot , but said of the episode , " For now , we ’ ll bask in the happiness of two main characters who have waited a long time for it . " Leitch , who called Holly the show 's " most beloved guest star " , also complimented the way the episode handled Michael and Holly 's brief reunion : " The couple and the producers seem to have come to the same conclusion about this relationship : Holly ( Amy Ryan ) can ’ t actually stay with Michael ( Steve Carell ) , so let ’ s just enjoy her while she ’ s here . " Travis Fickett of IGN complimented the episode but said it " doesn 't really reach that high " , which he said was disappointing following a string of eventful episodes . He praised the Holly character and the way Jim and Dwight worked so well together during the volleyball game , and although he said the final scene was a nice moment between Jim and Pam , he also said the twist was " predictable and telegraphed " . 
 TV Guide listed the final scene about Pam 's pregnancy as one of the twelve top television moments from the week it aired .

 = Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance = 
 The Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance is an honor presented to recording artists for quality rap performances . It was first presented at the 31st Annual Grammy Awards in 1989 and again at the 32nd Annual Grammy Awards in 1990 , after which point the award was split into two categories : Best Rap Solo Performance and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group . These two categories were combined again in 2012 as a result of a restructure of Grammy categories , and the reinstated Award for Best Rap Performance was presented at the 54th Grammy Awards in 2012 . 
 The Grammy Awards , an annual ceremony established in 1958 , and originally called the Gramophone Awards , are presented by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences ( NARAS ) of the United States to " honor artistic achievement , technical proficiency and overall excellence in the recording industry , without regard to album sales or chart position " . 
 The first award for Best Rap Performance was presented to DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince ( the vocal duo consisting of DJ Jazzy Jeff and Will Smith ) for " Parents Just Don 't Understand " . The ceremony was not without controversy ; nominees Jeff and Smith led a boycott in protest of the awards presentation not being televised , and some members of the rap community felt that more qualified artists were overlooked . 
 Rappers Jay Z , Kanye West and Kendrick Lamar are two time winners of this award . 
 The restructuring of the categories and combination of Best Rap Solo Performance and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group back into Best Rap Performance was the consequence of the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences ' wish to decrease the number of categories and awards and to eliminate distinctions between solo and duo or group performances . 
 = = Background = = 
 The Best Rap Performance category was first presented at the 31st Annual Grammy Awards in 1989 . NARAS President Mike Green said in Billboard that the music genre has " matured into several kinds of music , with several kinds of artists doing it " . Diane Theriot , a representative of the awards department for the Academy , recalled being " inundated with eligible rap entries during the first few years of having the category " . In 1991 , the category was split into the categories Best Rap Solo Performance and Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group . Recognizing that both categories were continuing to receive numerous entries , the Best Rap Album recognition was established for the 38th Grammy Awards in 1996 — the inaugural award was presented to Naughty by Nature for Poverty 's Paradise . In 2003 , the Best Rap Solo Performance category was divided into separate recognitions for Female and Male Rap Solo Performances . The categories remained separated by gender until 2005 when they were combined into the genderless category originally known as Best Rap Solo Performance . Additional rap categories include Best Rap / Sung Collaboration and Best Rap Song , established in 2002 and 2004 , respectively .

 For the 31st Grammy Awards ( 1989 ) , Best Rap Performance nominees included DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince for " Parents Just Don 't Understand " , J. J. Fad for " Supersonic " ( from the album of the same name ) , Kool Moe Dee for " Wild Wild West " , LL Cool J for " Going Back to Cali " , and Salt @-@ n @-@ Pepa ( the duo consisting of Cheryl James and Sandra Denton ) for " Push It " . The duo known as DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince consisted of DJ Jazzy Jeff ( birth name Jeffrey Townes ) and actor Will Smith , whose nickname also appeared in the American television sitcom The Fresh Prince of Bel @-@ Air , in which he starred . " Parents Just Don 't Understand " appeared on the duo 's 1988 album He 's the DJ , I 'm the Rapper . " Going Back to Cali " appeared on the soundtrack to the film Less Than Zero as well as LL Cool J 's 1989 studio album Walking with a Panther . Kool Moe Dee 's " Wild Wild West " and Salt @-@ n @-@ Pepa 's " Push It " appeared on the albums How Ya Like Me Now and Hot , Cool & Vicious , respectively . 
 Rap and heavy metal categories were introduced the same year ( along with Best Bluegrass Album ) , but , according to the show 's producers , time constraints prevented both categories from being televised . Nominee Kool Moe Dee performed during the ceremony , but the rap award was presented during the " usually fast @-@ paced pre @-@ televised ceremony " . DJ Jazzy Jeff and Will Smith led a boycott of the ceremony and were joined by fellow nominees LL Cool J and Salt @-@ n @-@ Pepa . Salt @-@ n @-@ Pepa issued the following statement : " If they don 't want us , we don 't want them . " Adding to the controversy surrounding the category , some members of the rap community believed artists such as Big Daddy Kane , KRS @-@ One , and N.W.A ( whose debut album Straight Outta Compton " launched gangsta rap " ) were overlooked . Awards were presented to Jeff and Smith at the Shrine Auditorium in Los Angeles . While Smith was absent from the ceremony , Jeff was present to accept his award . In 2004 , Serena Kappes of People magazine ranked Smith 's ceremony boycott number eight on its list of Top 10 Grammy Moments . Jeff and Smith were also recognized by the American Music Awards in 1989 with awards for Favorite Rap Artists and Favorite Rap Album , and " Parent 's Just Don 't Understand " also earned the duo the first MTV Video Music Award for Best Rap Video . Smith later earned Best Rap Solo Performance awards in 1998 for " Men in Black " and 1999 for " Gettin ' Jiggy wit It " , and was nominated again in 2000 for " Wild Wild West " . 
 Nominees for the 32nd Annual Grammy Awards included De La Soul for " Me Myself and I " , DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince for " I Think I Can Beat Mike Tyson " , Public Enemy for " Fight the Power " , Tone Lōc for " Funky Cold Medina " , and Young MC for " Bust a Move " . " Me Myself and I " appears on De La Soul 's studio album 3 Feet High and Rising and in 2008 was ranked number 46 on VH1 's list of the 100 Greatest Hip Hop Songs Ever ! ! ! " I Think I Can Beat Mike Tyson " , written by the duo along with Pete Harris , appears on DJ Jazzy Jeff & The Fresh Prince 's third album And in This Corner .... " Fight the Power " appeared on the 1988 soundtrack for the film Do the Right Thing and later on Public Enemy 's third studio album Fear of a Black Planet ( 1990 ) . The song ranked number one on VH1 's aforementioned list , number 40 on AFI 's 100 Years ... 100 Songs list , and number 322 on Rolling Stone 's 2004 list of " The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time " . " Funky Cold Medina " , written by Young MC , Michael L. Ross and Matt Dike , first appeared on Tone Lōc 's debut album Lōc @-@ ed After Dark . " Bust a Move " appeared on Young MC 's debut album Stone Cold <unk> ' . Allmusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine described the song as " unabashed catchy " due to its " skittish , rhythmic guitar riff , looped beats " , backing vocals , and " funny " rhymes . The award was presented to Young MC . In 2010 , Joshua Ostroff of Spinner included Young MC 's win on his list of " The Grammy Awards ' Biggest Mistakes " , asserting that " Bust a Move " was merely a " fun little hip @-@ pop song " while " Fight the Power " was a " revelatory single that still stands tall as one of music 's greatest ( and funkiest ) political statements and perhaps hip @-@ hop 's finest moment " .

 = Banksia dentata = 
 Banksia dentata , commonly known as the tropical banksia , is a species of tree in the genus Banksia . It occurs across northern Australia , southern New Guinea and the Aru Islands . Growing as a gnarled tree to 7 m ( 23 ft ) high , it has large green leaves up to 22 cm ( 8 @.@ 7 in ) long with dentate ( toothed ) margins . The cylindrical yellow inflorescences ( flower spikes ) , up to 13 cm ( 5 @.@ 1 in ) high , appear over the cooler months , attracting various species of honeyeaters , sunbirds , the sugar glider and a variety of insects . Flowers fall off the ageing spikes , which swell and develop follicles containing up to two viable seeds each . 
 Banksia dentata is one of four Banksia species collected by Sir Joseph Banks in 1770 , and one of the four species published in 1782 as part of Carolus Linnaeus the Younger 's original description of Banksia . Within the genus , it is classified in the series Salicinae , a group of species from Australia 's eastern states . Genetic studies show it is a basal member ( early offshoot ) within the group . Banksia dentata is found in tropical grassland known as savanna , associated with Pandanus and Melaleuca . It regenerates from bushfire by regrowing from its woody base , known as a lignotuber . 
 = = Description = = 
 The tropical banksia is generally a small tree which grows to around 4 m ( 13 ft ) or sometimes 7 m ( 23 ft ) tall , with a rough stocky trunk , spreading crown , and crooked branches . The dark grey bark is not flaky but tesselated in texture and appearance . Initially covered in reddish hair that wears away , branchlets become smooth and grey with age . The large green leaves are scattered along the stems , and more crowded at the branchlet tips . They are 9 – 22 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 – 8 @.@ 7 in ) long and 2 – 9 cm ( 0 @.@ 79 – 3 @.@ 54 in ) wide , obovate in shape with mucronate tips . The dentate ( toothed ) margins are lined irregularly with 0 @.@ 1 – 1 @.@ 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 039 – 0 @.@ 512 in ) long teeth , separated by u @-@ shaped sinuses . The leaves are undulate ( wavy ) with white undersurfaces , the midrib raised underneath and depressed above . The cylindrical yellow inflorescences ( flower spikes ) , arise from one- to three @-@ year @-@ old branches . Appearing between November and May , they are 10 to 13 cm ( 3 @.@ 9 to 5 @.@ 1 in ) high and 5 to 10 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 to 3 @.@ 9 in ) wide . Newly opened flower spikes smell like corn . All flower parts are pale yellow ; the perianth is 2 @.@ 5 – 3 @.@ 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 98 – 1 @.@ 26 in ) long , including a 0 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 20 in ) long limb . After anthesis , the pistil is 3 @.@ 1 – 4 @.@ 6 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 – 1 @.@ 8 in ) long . Flower parts soon fall off ageing spikes , which develop into irregular @-@ cylindrical infructescences . The oval follicles are 1 @.@ 5 – 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 59 – 0 @.@ 79 in ) long , 0 @.@ 4 – 0 @.@ 8 cm ( 0 @.@ 16 – 0 @.@ 31 in ) high and 0 @.@ 5 – 0 @.@ 8 cm ( 0 @.@ 20 – 0 @.@ 31 in ) wide . Pale green and furry when young , they become smooth and pale brown with age . The follicles open spontaneously with maturity . They contain two seeds each , between which lies a woody dark brown separator of similar shape to the seeds . Measuring 1 @.@ 8 – 2 @.@ 1 cm ( 0 @.@ 7 – 0 @.@ 8 in ) in length , the seed is obovate , and composed of a dark brown 1 @.@ 1 – 1 @.@ 4 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 – 0 @.@ 6 in ) wide membranous ' wing ' and obovate seed proper which measures 1 @.@ 0 – 1 @.@ 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 4 – 0 @.@ 5 in ) long by 0 @.@ 5 – 0 @.@ 8 cm ( 0 @.@ 2 – 0 @.@ 3 in ) wide . The seed surface can be smooth or covered in tiny ridges . 
 The bright green cotyledons are obovate , measuring 1 @.@ 6 – 1 @.@ 9 cm ( 0 @.@ 63 – 0 @.@ 75 in ) long by 0 @.@ 8 – 1 @.@ 1 cm ( 0 @.@ 31 – 0 @.@ 43 in ) wide . At the base of each are two pointed auricles around 1 @.@ 5 mm long . The cotyledons arise from a 3 – 4 mm high smooth hypocotyl that is 1 – 1 @.@ 5 mm in diameter . The subsequent seedling leaves are opposite initially , arising 3 – 4 mm above the cotyledons . Each is roughly linear in shape , measuring 2 @.@ 5 – 2 @.@ 7 cm ( 0 @.@ 98 – 1 @.@ 06 in ) long and 0 @.@ 4 – 0 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 16 – 0 @.@ 20 in ) wide , with two to three serrations ( " teeth " ) on the upper quarter to third of the leaf margin 's length . The leaf undersurface is covered with white hair . Successive leaves become more obovate and are 3 – 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 – 2 @.@ 8 in ) long and 0 @.@ 8 – 1 @.@ 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 31 – 0 @.@ 47 in ) wide , with dentate margins and mucronate tips . Seedling stems are hairy .

 Specimens of Banksia dentata were collected from the vicinity of the Endeavour River somewhere between 17 June and 3 August 1770 by Joseph Banks and Daniel Solander , naturalists on the Endeavour during Lieutenant ( later Captain ) James Cook 's first voyage to the Pacific Ocean . However , the description of the species was not published until April 1782 , when Carolus Linnaeus the Younger described the first four Banksia species in his Supplementum Plantarum . Linnaeus distinguished them by their leaf shapes , and named them accordingly . Thus this species ' dentate ( toothed ) leaf margins saw it given the specific name dentata , the Latin adjective for " toothed " . Banksia dentata is monotypic , and no subspecies are recognised . Though not closely studied , reports suggest it does not vary significantly over its range . 
 Robert Brown recorded 31 species of Banksia in his 1810 work Prodromus Florae Novae Hollandiae et Insulae Van Diemen , and in his taxonomic arrangement , placed the taxon in the subgenus Banksia verae , the " True Banksias " , because the inflorescence is a typical Banksia flower spike . By the time Carl Meissner published his 1856 arrangement of the genus , there were 58 described Banksia species . Meissner divided Brown 's Banksia verae , which had been renamed Eubanksia by Stephan Endlicher in 1847 , into four series based on leaf properties . He placed B. dentata in the series Quercinae ( the oak @-@ like banksias ) . 
 In 1870 , George Bentham published a thorough revision of Banksia in his Flora Australiensis . In Bentham 's arrangement , the number of recognised Banksia species was reduced from 60 to 46 . Bentham defined four sections based on leaf , style and pollen @-@ presenter characters . Banksia dentata was placed in section Eubanksia alongside B. marginata and a broadly defined B. integrifolia . 
 A major disruption to Banksia nomenclature occurred in 1891 , when Otto Kuntze challenged Banksia L.f. on the grounds that Johann Reinhold Forster and his son Georg had already penned the name Banksia to describe a different genus of plant , and hence Banksia J.R.Forst & G. Forst took precedence and rendered Banksia L.f. ( i.e. as used by Linnaeus ) invalid . Kuntze transferred all Banksia taxa to the new name Sirmuellera ; thus B. dentata became Sirmuellera dentata ( L.f. ) Kuntze . Kuntze 's challenge failed , as did a similar challenge by James Britten in 1905 . Britten proposed the generic name Isostylis , republishing B. dentata as Isostylis dentata ( L.f. ) Britten . In 1940 Banksia L.f. was formally conserved against future challenges . 
 Commonly known as the tropical banksia , B. dentata is known locally as swamp banksia , and <unk> by the indigenous people in Kakadu National Park . Its local name in the <unk> language of eastern Arnhem Land is <unk> . Other names from the same region include <unk> in the <unk> language of Groote Eylandt , and <unk> in the <unk> language of <unk> . Frederick Manson Bailey reported in 1913 that the indigenous people of Cape Bedford knew it as <unk> . 
 = = = Placement within Banksia = = = 
 The current taxonomic arrangement of the genus Banksia is based on botanist Alex George 's 1999 monograph for the Flora of Australia book series . In this arrangement , B. dentata is placed in Banksia subgenus Banksia , because its inflorescences take the form of Banksia 's characteristic flower spikes , section Banksia because of its straight styles , and series Salicinae because its inflorescences are cylindrical . There has been debate on which species it is most closely related to . Alf Salkin had noted that B. dentata displays characteristics which are primitive within the genus . Unlike southern banksias , it has small juvenile leaves and broad dentate adult leaves . Alex George concluded initially that its affinities lay with Banksia integrifolia on account of their similar inflorescences . In a morphological cladistic analysis published in 1994 , Kevin Thiele placed it in the newly described subseries <unk> along with B. plagiocarpa , B. robur and B. oblongifolia within the series Salicinae . These four species all have follicles which point slightly upwards towards the apex of the flower spike . It was held to be most closely related to B. robur on account of its large undulate leaves . Salkin had also noted that the seedling leaves of B. dentata , B. robur and B. oblongifolia were all similar and roughly linear , suggesting a close relationship . However , this subgrouping of the Salicinae was not supported by George ; he discounted a close relationship with B. robur , which he felt was too distinctive . B. dentata 's placement within Banksia according to Flora of Australia is as follows : 
 Genus Banksia

 Section Coccinea

 Since 1998 , American botanist Austin Mast and co @-@ authors have been publishing results of ongoing cladistic analyses of DNA sequence data for the subtribe Banksiinae , which then comprised genera Banksia and Dryandra . Their analyses suggest a phylogeny that differs greatly from George 's taxonomic arrangement . Banksia dentata resolves as an early offshoot within the Salicinae . In 2007 , Mast and Thiele rearranged the genus Banksia by merging Dryandra into it , and published B. subg . Spathulatae for the taxa having spoon @-@ shaped cotyledons ; thus B. subg . Banksia was redefined as encompassing taxa lacking spoon @-@ shaped cotyledons . They foreshadowed publishing a full arrangement once DNA sampling of Dryandra was complete ; in the meantime , if Mast and Thiele 's nomenclatural changes are taken as an interim arrangement , B. dentata is placed in B. subg . Spathulatae . 
 = = Distribution and habitat = = 
 Across northern Australia , Banksia dentata has been recorded as far west as the King Leopold Ranges in the western Kimberley through the Northern Territory and extending south to Katherine Gorge and into Queensland , where it is found on the Cape York Peninsula to as far south as Cooktown . Off the coast , it has been recorded from Groote Eylandt and the Wessel Islands , as well as Melville and Bathurst Islands . It also extends onto the Aru Islands , where it is found around <unk> , and New Guinea , where it ranges in the south from Merauke east to Port Moresby , and around Bulolo and Mount Mau . It is the only Banksia species not endemic to Australia . As much of its range is in remote and poorly surveyed country , it is possible that it is found more widely than has been recorded . Pollen samples indicate it has been present on the Torres Strait Islands over the past 8000 years , though it has not been a prominent component of the island flora . 
 Banksia dentata generally grows on sandy soils in savanna woodland or shrubland , along freshwater swamps , watercourses , floodplains or other seasonally wet areas . It has also been found on rocky outcrops , of quartzite or sandstone , to an elevation of around 500 m ( 1 @,@ 600 ft ) in Australia , and up to 1 @,@ 200 m ( 3 @,@ 900 ft ) in New Guinea . In New Guinea it is restricted to areas which have a distinct dry season . 
 Banksia dentata is often found with Melaleuca and Pandanus species . On Cape York , it is a dominant component in a low scrub known as " wet desert " due to its resemblance to arid scrub yet occurring in a monsoon climate . On phosphorus @-@ poor soils , Banksia dentata is found with Melaleuca saligna and <unk> <unk> . On Melville Island it is a dominant component of Banksia low woodland , forming part of a 3 – 6 m ( 9 @.@ 8 – 19 @.@ 7 ft ) high canopy with Melaleuca <unk> ; the understory is composed of sedges such as <unk> , Sorghum <unk> , <unk> , <unk> grandiflora and the <unk> <unk> <unk> , as well as suckering shrubs <unk> lactifluus and Syzygium <unk> . This community grows in wet areas , with a grey topsoil with high moisture and gravel content but low sand . 
 = = Ecology = = 
 Banksia dentata responds to bushfire by resprouting from its woody lignotuber although , unlike other members of the Salicinae , it lacks dormant buds at its base . It was described by amateur botanist and banksia enthusiast Alf Salkin as resembling an " upturned parsnip " . Plant communities where it is found are subject to periodic bushfires , and it can become more dominant if fires occur often . 
 Salkin had noted that its tropical position might mean that B. dentata was a key species in the transition from rainforest to open habitat in the ancestry of the genus . One adaptation to a drier sunnier climate was a thick intermediate layer under the epidermis in the leaf architecture . This layer , the hypodermis , contains large vacuoles that are filled with a phenolic compound , and seems to serve to reduce the intensity of sunlight reaching the mesophyll . 
 Numerous nectar @-@ feeding insects are attracted to the flower spikes , which in turn attract honeyeaters , silvereyes and sunbirds , many of which consume both nectar and insects . The sugar glider ( Petaurus breviceps ) forages among the flower spikes and is a probable pollinator . The common blossom bat ( <unk> australis ) feeds on nectar . B. dentata has been recorded as a host plant for the mistletoe species <unk> <unk> , <unk> angustata and D. signata . 
 = = Cultivation = = 
 The tree 's gnarled bark , large green leaves , and yellow flower spikes are attractive horticultural features . B. dentata is vulnerable to cold winters in cultivation in Melbourne and recovers over the hotter months of summer . It has not been able to be grown in colder climates , such as those of Canberra . Flowering occurs around 5 to 8 years from seed . Plants can be pruned hard , and do best on a sandy slightly acid soil of pH 5 @.@ 5 – 6 @.@ 5 . They can be vulnerable to borers . Seeds do not require any treatment , and take 32 to 40 days to germinate . Banksia dentata was introduced into the United Kingdom in 1822 . 
 Banksia dentata is used as a nectar source in the honey bee industry . Aborigines in the Northern Territory would light old seed cones and use them as firebrands , these lasting for up to two hours . The nectar was consumed by indigenous people . A hot smoking flower spike was used to <unk> leprosy sores , and people suffering from diarrhea would squat over smoking cones in the hope this would relieve their symptoms . The thin woody spikes that did not develop follicles were used as nasal ornaments by aboriginal women , and flower spikes were used as combs . 
 = Second Battle of Algeciras = 
 The Second Battle of Algeciras ( also known as the Battle of the Gut of Gibraltar ) was a naval battle fought on the night of 12 July 1801 ( 23 messidor an IX of the French Republican Calendar ) between a squadron of British Royal Navy ships of the line and a larger squadron of ships from the Spanish Navy and French Navy in the Gut of Gibraltar . The battle followed closely the First Battle of Algeciras on 6 July , in which a French squadron anchored at the Spanish port of Algeciras was attacked by a larger British squadron based at nearby Gibraltar . In a heavy engagement fought in calm weather in the close confines of Algeciras Bay , the British force had been becalmed and battered , suffering heavy casualties and losing the 74 @-@ gun ship HMS Hannibal . Retiring for repairs , both sides called up reinforcements , the French receiving support first , from the Spanish fleet based at Cadiz , which sent six ships of the line to escort the French squadron to safety . 
 Arriving at Algeciras on 9 July , the combined squadron was ready to sail again on 12 July , departing Algeciras to the westwards during the evening . The British squadron under Rear @-@ Admiral Sir James Saumarez , having effected its own hasty repairs , set off in pursuit . Finding that his ships were falling behind , Saumarez instructed his captains to separate and attack the combined squadron as best they were able to . The fastest ship was HMS Superb under Captain Richard Goodwin Keats , which sailed through the Spanish rearguard as a moonless night fell . Superb fired on the rearmost ships , setting the 112 @-@ gun Real Carlos on fire and capturing the Saint Antoine . Unable to determine friend from foe in the darkness , Real Carlos inadvertently engaged the Spanish ship San Hermenegildo , spreading the fire to its compatriot . Both ships subsequently exploded with enormous loss of life . A second stage of the battle then developed , as HMS Venerable took the lead of the British line , attacking the rearmost French ship Formidable under Captain Amable Troude . In a furious and protracted engagement , Venerable suffered heavy damage and was driven ashore , allowing the remainder of the French force to return to Cadiz without further fighting . 
 In the aftermath of the action , Venerable was towed off the shoreline and back to Gibraltar for repairs , while the remainder of the British squadron restored the British blockade of the French and Spanish ships in Cadiz , returning the situation to that in place before the battle . This British victory , coming so soon after Saumarez 's defeat in Algeciras harbour , did much to restore parity in the region and the heavy casualties inflicted on the Spanish were to contribute to a weakening of the Franco @-@ Spanish alliance which was a contributory factor in the signing of Treaty of Amiens , which brought the war to a temporary halt early the following year . In France , despite the heavy Spanish losses , the battle was celebrated as a victory , with Troude widely praised and promoted for the defence of his ship .

With the Royal Navy dominant in the Mediterranean Sea and their army trapped in Egypt , the French sought in 1801 to augment their depleted forces in the region by sending reinforcements from the Atlantic Fleet and by purchasing ships from the Spanish Navy , based in Cadiz . A squadron sailed from Brest on the Atlantic in January and made three failed attempts to reach Egypt , which was facing a large British invasion , before abandoning the effort and retiring to Toulon on the French Mediterranean coast . Three ships of the line , Formidable , Indomptable and Desaix , had been detached from the squadron in May however and were subsequently placed under the command of Contre @-@ Admiral Charles Linois under orders to sail for Cadiz . At Cadiz , the Spanish fleet had agreed to sell six ships of the line to the French Navy , and on 13 June two French frigates , Libre and Indienne , arrived at the port to oversee the transfer under the command of Contre @-@ Admiral Dumanoir le Pelley . 
 En route to Cadiz , Linois had learned from the crew of the captured brig HMS Speedy that a powerful British squadron of seven ships of the line under Rear @-@ Admiral Sir James Saumarez lay off Cadiz , blockading the port . Concerned that this squadron could overwhelm his own , Linois took shelter in the small but well @-@ defended harbour of Algeciras , just across Algeciras Bay from the heavily fortified British naval base at Gibraltar . Saumarez was informed of Linois 's arrival , and turned eastwards to confront him , discovering the French ships anchored in a well prepared position on the morning of 6 July . Saumarez attacked immediately , but found that his ships were hampered by a lack of wind . Becalmed under heavy fire , the British squadron inflicted severe damage on the French ships which withdrew into shallower water , two grounding . However , when Saumarez ordered his ships to follow , HMS Hannibal grounded as well , trapped under a heavy barrage from the shore . With no wind with which to manoeuvre and the squadron 's boats all either sunk or engaged in towing the battered HMS Pompée back to Gibraltar , Saumarez called off the attack at 13 : 35 . The battered British squadron retired to Gibraltar , except for Hannibal , which was trapped , battered and swiftly forced to surrender , having lost two masts and more than 140 men . 
 = = = Passage of Moreno = = = 
 With both squadrons badly damaged , reinforcements were called for , Linois sending a messenger overland to Cadiz with an appeal for the Spanish fleet there , under Admiral Don Jose de Mazzaredo to send a squadron to escort the French force in Algeciras to the safety of Cadiz . At Cadiz , le Pelley had to plead with Mazzaredo for assistance , the Spanish admiral agreeing on 8 July to send a powerful squadron under Vice @-@ Admiral Don Juan Joaquin de Moreno to Algeciras . Moreno 's force consisted of two 112 @-@ gun first rate ships of the line , Real Carlos and San Hermenegildo , the 96 @-@ gun San Fernando , 80 @-@ gun Argonauta and the 74 @-@ gun San Agustín . With this force was the 74 @-@ gun French ship Saint Antoine , which a few days earlier had been the Spanish San Antonio . Saint Antoine was the first of the French ships purchased from the Spanish Navy to enter service , the crew drawn from the crews of le Pelley 's frigates supplemented by Spanish sailors and commanded by Commodore Julien le Ray . With the squadron were the frigates Libre , Indienne and the Spanish Sabina as well as the French lugger Vautour . 
 The combined squadron sailed from Cadiz on 9 July , progressing rapidly southwards and reaching Algeciras Bay late in the afternoon , except for Saint Antoine which was delayed and arrived the following morning . The force was anchored close to Algeciras , well out of range of cannon at Gibraltar , and there waited for Linois to finish making the necessary repairs to his ships . <unk> the combined squadron was a small British force under Captain Richard Goodwin Keats on HMS Superb with the frigate HMS Thames and the brig HMS Pasley . Although part of Saumarez 's squadron , Keats had been too late to take part in the first battle , and had instead cruised off Cadiz watching the Spanish fleet there . When Moreno sailed , Keats was initially chased by portions of the Franco @-@ Spanish squadron , but eluded and followed them , subsequently joining Saumarez at Gibraltar . At the British port , the dockyards were the scene of frantic activity as Saumarez , supported by commissioner Captain Alexander Ball , sought to repair his squadron so that it could intercept Moreno 's forces on their voyage back to Cadiz . Pompée was temporarily abandoned in the yard , her crew redistributed to work on the rest of the squadron . Saumarez also gave orders that his flagship , HMS Caesar was also to be left at Gibraltar , but Captain Jahleel Brenton requested the opportunity to repair his ship and Saumarez relented , the crew of Caesar working all day and in shifts throughout the night in order to bring their ship up to fighting standard . Saumarez believed however that due to the condition of Linois 's ships and the mistaken assumption that the combined squadron would sail for Cartagena to the east , he would have at least two weeks to prepare and sent messages to the Mediterranean Fleet under Lord Keith , then at sea off Egypt , requesting support against the combined squadron . 
 = = Battle = = 
 On 11 July the activity on Moreno 's ships indicated to British observers at Gibraltar that the combined squadron was readying for sea , and the British working parties repairing Saumarez 's squadron correspondingly redoubled their efforts . The arrival of a light easterly wind which would favour passage back to Cadiz encouraged both Moreno and Saumarez to prepare for departure to the Atlantic base on the following day . At 12 : 00 on 12 July , Caesar warped out of Gibraltar dockyard with her band playing the popular song " Heart of Oak " to the answering strains of " Britons , Strike Home ! " from the dockside as crowds again turned out in their thousands to watch the coming battle . By that time however , Moreno 's forces were already at sea : at dawn on 12 July the leading Spanish ships loosed their sails and by 12 : 00 the French and Spanish squadron had begun to gather at their rendezvous point off Cabrita Point at the mouth of Algeciras Bay . At 15 : 00 , Saumarez set sail , his pennant flying from Caesar and followed by ships of the line Superb , HMS Spencer , HMS Venerable and HMS Audacious , frigates Thames and the Portuguese Carlotta and several smaller vessels . Both Saumarez and Linois expected reinforcements sent by Lord Keith to arrive during the day , but none appeared . 
 At 19 : 00 , delayed by the effect of the Rock of Gibraltar on the wind , the British squadron rounded Gibraltar and found the French and Spanish ships still assembling at Cabrita Point . The light wind prevented any rapid movement , and Saumarez began to slowly tack towards the combined squadron in line of battle formation . The delay with Moreno 's departure had been due to the state of the captured Hannibal , renamed Annibal , which was unable to make any progress under its jury masts and had been taken under tow by the frigate Indienne . Sighting Saumarez 's force , Moreno instructed Indienne and Hannibal to return to Algeciras and at 19 : 45 issued orders for the remainder of the squadron to sail eastwards through the Gut of Gibraltar towards Cadiz . He also , following Spanish naval tradition , disembarked his flagship Real Carlos and transferred to the frigate Sabina , persuading Linois to quit Formidable and do the same . 
 = = = Superb and the rearguard = = = 
 At 20 : 00 , Saumarez led his ships into the Gut after the combined squadron , but in the gathering dusk Moreno 's squadron was already out of sight and the British admiral realised that his ships were too slow to catch the French and Spanish ships in their current formation before they reached the comparative safety of the open ocean . At 20 : 40 , with the wind picking up , he therefore instructed the squadron to break formation and attack the rear of the combined squadron , directing his orders at Keats in Superb , whose ship was the fastest . Keats immediately set all sail and by 22 : 00 had regained sight of the combined squadron 's rearguard , which consisted of the 112 @-@ gun ships and the Saint Antoine . Behind , all Keats could see was Caesar and Venerable in the distance , and by 23 : 00 only Caesar was still in sight , more than 3 nautical miles ( 5 @.@ 6 km ) behind Superb . Although he was now facing considerable odds , Keats steered Superb to within 350 yards ( 320 m ) of the Real Carlos at 23 : 20 , coming under fire from all three vessels of the Franco @-@ Spanish rearguard , although evading much of it by the simple tactic of not illuminating his ship so that the ships of the combined squadron fired on one another more than on their British opponent . Linois had also ordered his ships to extinguish their lights , but this only added to the confusion of the Spanish ships in the squadron . The moon had set and the night was quite dark , which contributed to the ineffectiveness of the Spanish gunnery . Real Carlos fired randomly at the British ship but failed to strike it once during the brief engagement . Keats ' ship was much more accurate however , firing three broadsides before Superb was carried beyond Real Carlos and towards Saint Antoine . The British broadsides caused severe damage , knocking away the foretopmast and causing a fire to break out on the Spanish ship 's deck following the third broadside . The fire grew rapidly and soon was so fierce that it could be plainly seen by observers at Gibraltar . 
 With Real Carlos disabled , Keats pushed on into combat with Saint Antoine , the combined French and Spanish crew engaging the British vessel as it approached . At 23 : 50 , Keats laid his ship close alongside the new French ship , beginning a close and heated action as the ships of the line exchanged broadsides with one another in pitch darkness and with an increasing wind . For 30 minutes the battle continued until , with the ships off Cape Spartel in North Africa , a wounded Le Ray decided that his ship was no longer able to contest the action and hailed Superb to announce that he had surrendered . The halyards that held up his pennant had however become tangled in the rigging , giving the appearance that the ship was still in French hands : this later led it to be attacked repeatedly by other British ships as they came up during the night . Formidable was also to the rear of the combined squadron , escaping attack by feigning British signal lights until it had safely passed the battle between Superb and Saint Antoine . Keats remained with his prize , awaiting the arrival of the rest of the squadron : Caesar , Venerable , Spencer and Thames arrived after midnight , all firing on Saint Antoine as they passed before continuing westwards in search of the remainder of Moreno 's squadron . Superb was later joined by Carlotta and the small ships HMS Calpe and Louisa , which remained on hand during the night . 
 To the east of the combat between Superb and Saint Antoine , the fire on Real Carlos blazed out of control , spreading throughout the ship . In the darkness , the blazing vessel stood out and was mistaken by the crew of San Hermenegildo for a British ship . Despite specific orders from Moreno for his captains to be sure of their targets , San Hermenegildo closed with the burning ship and fired several broadsides into Real Carlos . The attack prompted a response and the two huge warships began a close exchange of fire that was only brought to a close when Real Carlos drifted into San Hermenegildo , the flames spreading from the former 's sails to the latter . Saumarez , on witnessing the sight , excitedly exclaimed to Brenton " My God sir , look there ! The day is ours ! " Within minutes both ships were tangled together , fire spreading unchecked throughout the vessels . The fire was too dangerous for British ships to make any rescue attempts , and although several hundred men managed to escape the wrecks on small boats , there were still more than 1 @,@ 700 sailors on board when first the Real Carlos at 00 : 15 and then the San Hermenegildo at 01 : 00 exploded as the flames reached their central magazines , killing both crews . 262 survivors in boats were taken aboard the captured Saint Antoine and 38 on Superb , while a handful managed to reach the rest of the Franco @-@ Spanish squadron , but the enormous loss of life in this incident was one of the worst maritime disasters to that time . 
 = = = Venerable and Formidable = = = 
 While Keats had remained with his prize Saumarez had led the remainder of the squadron forward , although Audacious had been left far behind the rest of the British force . The French and Spanish ships had scattered as Superb attacked the rearguard and during the night each made their way separately to the rendezvous off Cadiz harbour . As dawn broke at 04 : 00 on 13 July , lookouts on the leading British ship of the line Venerable under Captain Samuel Hood spotted the French ship Formidable , under the command of Captain Amable Troude in the absence of Linois , to the north . Formidable was trailing the rest of the squadron , close to the shore in Conil Bay to the south of Cadiz and north of Cape Trafalgar . The wind was light and coming from the land and so Caesar and Spencer , the latter being a long way behind the others , were unable to approach the French ship and it was left to Venerable and Thames , both inshore and therefore better able to make use of the wind , to lead the attack . Formidable had only jury topmasts following the battle on 6 July , and so Hood was able to rapidly approach the French ship , coming under fire from Troude 's stern guns at 05 : 15 , Hood holding off from replying until 05 : 20 so as to not delay his progress . The light breeze was at that point in Hood 's favour , and Venerable was able to come close alongside Formidable and open fire with a full broadside . Off Cadiz , the remnants of Moreno 's squadron formed up with the intention of sailing to Formidable 's aid , but were struck by a calm and could only watch the battle to the south . 
 Venerable took the worst of the early action and at 05 : 30 the mizen topmast was shot away . Hood responded by ordering Captain <unk> Hollis in Thames to approach Troude 's stern , the frigate repeatedly raking the French ship under fire from the ineffective stern guns . For another hour the ships traded broadsides , until at 06 : 45 the mainmast of Venerable collapsed over the side , significantly retarding the ship 's movement . Formidable was able to pull ahead slowly in the light and unreliable winds , continuing to fire the stern guns at the now immobile British ship . Venerable was now drifting out of control , the foremast collapsing at 07 : 50 as the ship grounded on the shoals at Sancti Petri , 12 miles ( 19 km ) south of Cadiz . With his main opponent disabled , Troude continued slowly towards Cadiz , out of range of the approaching Caesar . 
 Saumarez sent Jahleel Brenton in a gig to Venerable at 08 : 00 , just as the foremast also fell overboard , with instructions that if the combined French and Spanish squadron , visible off Cadiz , should proceed south to attack the grounded British vessel then Hood should remove his crew and set his ship on fire . Thames was brought close alongside in order to evacuate the ship if the need arose , but Hood refused the order and insisted that he would be able to save his ship . Eventually the arrival of Audacious and Superb on the southern horizon decided the issue as Moreno abandoned any intention to counterattack , instead entering Cadiz harbour with his squadron , followed by Troude in Formidable . Their arrival was greeted with cheers from the city 's population , unaware of the disaster in the Gut of Gibraltar . The confusion meant that the situations of the lost ships were unknown , and Saint Antoine 's arrival was still anticipated at Cadiz as late as 16 July . 
 = = Aftermath = = 
 = = = Casualties = = = 
 With the immediate threat gone , Saumarez was able to direct his squadron 's efforts to salvaging the battered and grounded Venerable . The calm sea and light winds aided this operation , and at 14 : 00 , assisted by Thames and the boats of Caesar and Spencer , Venerable was once again afloat . Hood 's ship was taken under tow by first Thames and then Spencer , the British squadron turning back towards Gibraltar at 18 : 00 , the crew rigging a series of jury masts and sails to assist the process . By 08 : 00 on 14 July , Venerable was again able to sail independently , the squadron arriving at Gibraltar later that day . At Gibraltar the returning squadron was greeted with cheers and a 21 @-@ gun salute . Spencer , Audacious and Thames remained at sea off Cadiz to continue the blockade , which remained in place until the end of the French Revolutionary Wars in March 1802 at the Peace of Amiens . 
 British casualties had been relatively light , incurred almost entirely on Venerable , which suffered 18 killed and 87 wounded . Superb had 15 men wounded including a lieutenant , all from the action with Saint Antoine , while the only other ship directly engaged was Thames , which hadn 't lost a single man either killed or wounded . Apart from Venerable none of the other ships had suffered any significant damage , including Superb and Thames . In the aftermath of the battle , Saumarez arranged a prisoner exchange , the crew of Saint Antoine sent into Algeciras in return for the release of the crew of Hannibal . Losses among the combined squadron were drastically heavier : Formidable reported 20 killed and an unreported number of wounded and Saint Antoine 's casualties were not reported at the time but were considered by later historians such as William James to " have been very severe " . By far the biggest loss however was on board the two destroyed 112 @-@ gun ships , each of which had had a crew of roughly 1 @,@ 000 men from which just over 300 are known to have escaped to other ships . The loss of more than 1 @,@ 700 Spanish sailors in the battle was one of the most severe losses of life in a single maritime incident to that time . 
 Finally , there was damage to two Spanish frigates : the Sabina was struck by cannon fire during the night killing one man and wounding five , although it was not determined which ship had fired on the flagship and James suggested that it may have been from one of the destroyed 112 @-@ gun ships in a case of friendly fire . In addition , the Spanish 34 @-@ gun frigate Perla was seen wallowing off the North African coast of the Strait of Gibraltar on the morning of 13 July , sinking later in the day due to severe damage . How Perla came to be engaged in the action has never been explained . The ship was not part of Moreno 's squadron at Algeciras and none of the British ships reported engaging a frigate during the night – during the hours of darkness Perla must have encountered the battle and become caught in the cross @-@ fire , suffering fatal damage . 
 = = = Effects = = = 
 In Britain the battle was celebrated , Saumarez having been deemed to have removed the stain of his defeat six days earlier in the battle in the Bay of Algeciras . He was awarded the thanks of both Houses of Parliament and , already a Knight Bachelor , made a Knight of the Bath with a pension of £ 1 @,@ 200 annually ( the equivalent of £ 82 @,@ 000 as of 2016 ) . The first lieutenants of Caesar , Superb and Venerable were promoted to commander and the captured Saint Antoine was commissioned into the Royal Navy as HMS San Antonio , although the age and small size of the ship meant that she was never suited to front line service and was instead stationed permanently at Portsmouth . Nearly five decades later , the second battle was among the actions recognised by the Naval General Service Medal , awarded upon application to all British participants still living in 1847 . 
 In France the battle was represented as a victory , largely based on a report sent to Paris by Dumanoir le Pelley on the strength of a letter written by Captain Troude , which claimed that he had fought not only Venerable and Thames , but also Caesar and Spencer ( misidentified in the report as Superb ) . Troude claimed that he had not only driven all of these ships off and completely destroyed Venerable by driving the ship ashore by 07 : 00 , but that he had then waited nearby until 10 : 00 in the hope of resuming the action . In reward for his services as represented , Troude was promoted and highly praised , later holding a number of important active commands in the French Navy . 
 The outcome of the battle , reversing the British defeat of 6 July , inflicting severe losses on the Spanish fleet at Cadiz and trapping Linois in Cadiz proved decisive in confirming British control of the Mediterranean Sea . With the French plan to reinforce the army stranded in Egypt in ruins , the British invasion fleet was free to operate without interference , succeeding in capturing the country in September 1801 . In a wider sense too , it emphasized the degree to which the Royal Navy dominated European waters , destroying any attempt by the navies of France and its allies to conduct operations at sea . In Spain the government , furious at the losses suffered for so little gain , began to distance themselves from the alliance with France , which was a contributing factor in the signing of the Treaty of Amiens in March 1802 that ended the French Revolutionary Wars . For the remainder of the war the British maintained undisputed control of the Mediterranean Sea and the Spanish coast , the Cadiz blockade preventing the French and Spanish forces there from putting to sea . 
 = Forksville Covered Bridge = 
 The Forksville Covered Bridge is a Burr arch truss covered bridge over Loyalsock Creek in the borough of Forksville , Sullivan County , in the U.S. state of Pennsylvania . It was built in 1850 and is 152 feet 11 inches ( 46 @.@ 61 m ) in length . The bridge was placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1980 . The Forksville bridge is named for the borough it is in , which in turn is named for its location at the confluence or " forks " of the Little Loyalsock and Loyalsock Creeks . 
 Pennsylvania had the first covered bridge in the United States and the most such bridges in both the 19th and 21st centuries . They were a transition between stone and metal bridges , with the roof and sides protecting the wooden structure from weather . The Forksville bridge is a Burr arch truss type , with a load @-@ bearing arch sandwiching multiple vertical king posts , for strength and rigidity . The building of the Forksville bridge was supervised by the 18 @-@ year @-@ old Sadler Rogers , who used his hand @-@ carved model of the structure . It served as the site of a stream gauge from 1908 to 1913 and is still an official Pennsylvania state highway bridge . The United States Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration uses it as the model of a covered bridge " classic gable roof " , and it serves as the logo of a Pennsylvania insurance company . 
 The bridge was restored in 1970 and 2004 and is still in use , with average daily traffic of 224 vehicles in 2009 . Despite the restorations , as of 2009 the bridge structure 's sufficiency rating on the National Bridge Inventory was only 17 @.@ 7 percent and its condition was deemed " basically intolerable requiring high priority of corrective action " . It is one of three remaining covered bridges in Sullivan County , and according to Susan M. Zacher 's The Covered Bridges of Pennsylvania : A Guide , its location " over the rocky Loyalsock Creek " is " one of the most attractive settings in the state . " 
 = = Overview = = 
 The covered bridge is in the borough of Forksville on Bridge Street , a spur of State Route 4012 , just west of Pennsylvania Route 154 . It is about 0 @.@ 2 miles ( 300 m ) south of Pennsylvania Route 87 and 2 @.@ 0 miles ( 3 km ) north of Worlds End State Park on PA 154 . Forksville Covered Bridge is its official name on the National Register of Historic Places ( NRHP ) . Sullivan County is located in north central Pennsylvania , about 123 miles ( 198 km ) northwest of Philadelphia and 195 miles ( 314 km ) east @-@ northeast of Pittsburgh . 
 The bridge is just upstream of the confluence of the Little Loyalsock and Loyalsock Creeks . This was known as the " forks of the Loyalsock " and gave Forks Township its name when the township was incorporated in 1833 , while still part of Lycoming County . Sullivan County was formed from part of Lycoming County on March 14 , 1847 , and the bridge was built in 1850 . The name of the bridge comes from the community of Forksville , which is on land first settled in 1794 , was laid out as a village in 1854 , and was incorporated as a borough from part of Forks Township on December 22 , 1880 . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Background = = = 
 The first covered bridge in the United States was built in 1800 over the Schuylkill River in Philadelphia , Pennsylvania . According to Zacher , the first covered bridges of the Burr arch truss design were also built in the state . Pennsylvania is estimated to have once had at least 1 @,@ 500 covered bridges and is believed to have had the most in the country between 1830 and 1875 . In 2001 , Pennsylvania had more surviving historic covered bridges than any other state , with 221 remaining in 40 of its 67 counties . 
 Covered bridges were a transition between stone and metal bridges , the latter made of cast @-@ iron or steel . In 19th @-@ century Pennsylvania , lumber was an abundant resource for bridge construction , but did not last long when exposed to the elements . The roof and enclosed sides of covered bridges protected the structural elements , allowing some of these bridges to survive for well over a century . A Burr arch truss consists of a load @-@ bearing arch sandwiching multiple king posts , resulting in stronger and more rigid structure than one made of either element alone . 
 = = = Construction and description = = = 
 Although there were 30 covered bridges in Sullivan County in 1890 , only five were left by 1954 , and as of 2011 only three remain : Forksville , Hillsgrove , and Sonestown . All three are Burr arch truss covered bridges and were built in 1850 . The Forksville Covered Bridge was built for Sullivan County by Sadler Rogers ( or Rodgers ) , a native of Forksville who was only 18 at the time . He hand @-@ carved a model of the bridge before work began and used it to supervise construction . Rogers built the Forksville and Hillsgrove bridges across Loyalsock Creek , with the latter about 5 miles ( 8 @.@ 0 km ) downstream of the former . Although most sources do not list the builder of the Sonestown bridge , a 1997 newspaper article on the remaining Sullivan County covered bridges reported that Rodgers had designed it too . 
 The Forksville Covered Bridge was added to the NRHP on July 24 , 1980 , in a Multiple Property Submission of seven Covered Bridges of Bradford , Sullivan and Lycoming Counties . The 2009 National Bridge Inventory ( NBI ) lists the covered bridge as 152 feet 11 inches ( 46 @.@ 6 m ) long , with a roadway 12 feet 2 inches ( 3 @.@ 7 m ) wide , and a maximum load of 3 @.@ 0 short tons ( 2 @.@ 7 metric tons ) . According to the NRHP , the bridge 's " road surface width " is 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) , which is only sufficient for a single lane of traffic . As of 2011 , each portal has a small sign reading " 1850 Sadler Rogers " at the top , above a sign with the posted clearance height of 8 @.@ 0 feet ( 2 @.@ 4 m ) , and a " No Trucks Allowed " sign hanging below these . 
 The covered bridge rests on the original stone abutments , which have since been reinforced with concrete . The bridge deck , which is now supported by steel beams , is made of " very narrow crosswise planks " . Wheel guards on the deck separate the roadway from the pedestrian walkways on either side and protect the sides , which are covered with vertical planks almost to the eaves . The bridge has long , narrow windows with wooden shutters : the south side has four windows , and the north side has three . An opening between the eaves and the siding runs the length of the bridge on both sides . The bridge is supported by a Burr arch truss of 16 panels , with wooden beams . The gable roof is sheet metal and is used as the model illustration of a " classic gable roof " for a covered bridge by the U.S. Department of Transportation Federal Highway Administration 's Turner @-@ Fairbank Highway Research Center .

 In the 19th century the Forksville Covered Bridge survived major floods on March 1 , 1865 , and June 1 , 1889 , that destroyed other bridges in the West Branch Susquehanna River valley . Between about 1870 and 1890 , logging in the Loyalsock Creek watershed produced lumber rafts that floated beneath the bridge . These rafts , each containing 5 @,@ 000 – 30 @,@ 000 board feet ( 12 – 70 m3 ) of lumber , were carried down the Loyalsock to its mouth at Montoursville , and some continued on the West Branch Susquehanna River beyond . The rafts ended when the eastern hemlock were all clearcut . 
 From 1908 to 1913 , there was a stream gauge on the bridge . Twice a day , the creek height was read on a chain 21 @.@ 88 feet ( 6 @.@ 67 m ) long on the bridge 's upstream side , and discharge measurements were taken on the downstream side . At the time it served as a " single span , wooden , covered highway bridge " . The bridge survived another major flood on November 16 , 1926 , when a dam broke upstream but was " badly damaged " by an ice jam on January 23 , 1959 , in a flood that left blocks of ice weighing up to 500 pounds ( 230 kg ) in the streets of Forksville . 
 The Forksville Covered Bridge was restored in 1970 with what the NRHP nomination form describes as " all kinds of odd repairs " . The restoration work was completed by T. Corbin Lewis of Hillsgrove Township , a retired electrical contractor , whose low bid of $ 48 @,@ 000 was accepted over a Baltimore , Maryland , firm 's $ 185 @,@ 000 bid . The restoration was supervised by the Pennsylvania Department of Transportation ( PennDOT ) , which owns and maintains the bridge . The repair involved minor work on the " steel floor beams and stringers " , which had been added years before . An entirely new wooden deck was installed , with wheel guards ( wooden curbs ) to channel vehicle traffic to the center and to protect the pedestrian walkways on the sides . Windows were cut in the bridge 's sides for the first time , and steel girders were " added to support the bridge 's <unk> . " 
 Attitudes towards covered bridges in Sullivan County changed considerably in the last half of the 20th century . Two of the five bridges remaining in 1954 were razed by 1970 , when PennDOT considered tearing down the Forksville bridge too . It was renovated rather than razed because of its historic nature and appeal to tourists . The Forksville Covered Bridge was added to the NRHP in 1980 , and the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission now forbids the destruction of any covered bridge on the NRHP in the state and has to approve any renovation work . 
 The NBI says the bridge was " reconstructed " in 2004 but does not give further details . The entire bridge has been reinforced with steel girders , including vertical beams . In 2006 the red bridge was repainted , which took about three weeks . 
 The bridge 's condition was described as " good " in the 1980 NRHP form , Zacher 's 1994 book , and the Evans ' 2001 book . However , the 2009 Federal Highway Administration National Bridge Inventory found the sufficiency rating of the bridge structure to be 17 @.@ 7 percent . It found that the bridge 's foundations were " determined to be stable for calculated scour conditions " but that the railing " does not meet currently acceptable standards " . Its overall condition was deemed " basically intolerable requiring high priority of corrective action " ; the 2006 NBI estimated the cost to improve the bridge at $ 463 @,@ 000 . 
 Today the Forksville Covered Bridge is heavily used , as it is the most direct and shortest route from PA 154 , at the eastern end , to Forksville and its general store , which are at the western end . In 2000 , Forksville had 147 residents . The posted speed limit is 15 miles per hour ( 24 km / h ) , and its average daily traffic was 224 vehicles in 2009 . The bridge is used as the logo of the Farmers & Mechanics Mutual Insurance Company , which was founded in Sullivan County in 1877 . 
 In addition to its utility , the bridge is appreciated for its history and beauty . In 1970 a long @-@ time Forksville resident spoke of the bridge 's connection to the past : " When you stand quiet on the bridge and the woods are still , you can almost hear the horses <unk> over the wooden deck as they did in years gone by ; you can almost see the youngsters who climbed the rafters of the bridge to ' skinny @-@ dip ' in the creek below " . Zacher 's 1994 The Covered Bridges of Pennsylvania : A Guide describes the bridge 's location " over the rocky Loyalsock Creek " as " one of the most attractive settings in the state . "

 The following table is a comparison of published measurements of length , width and load recorded by four different sources using different methods , as well as the name cited for the bridge and its builder . The NBI measures bridge length between the " backwalls of abutments " or pavement grooves and the roadway width as " the most restrictive minimum distance between curbs or rails " . The NRHP form was prepared by the Pennsylvania Historical and Museum Commission ( PHMC ) , which surveyed county engineers , historical and covered bridge societies , and others for all the covered bridges in the commonwealth . The Evans visited every covered bridge in Pennsylvania in 2001 and measured each bridge 's length ( portal to portal ) and width ( at the portal ) for their book . The data in Zacher 's book was based on a 1991 survey of all covered bridges in Pennsylvania by the PHMC and PennDOT , aided by local government and private agencies . The article uses primarily the NBI and NRHP data , as they are national programs .

 The Florida State University ( commonly referred to as Florida State or FSU ) is an American public space @-@ grant and sea @-@ grant research university . Its primary campus is located on a 1 @,@ 391 @.@ 54 @-@ acre ( 5 @.@ 631 km2 ) campus in Tallahassee , Florida , United States . It is a senior member of the State University System of Florida . Founded in 1851 , it is located on the oldest continuous site of higher education in the state of Florida . 
 The University is classified as a Research University with Very High Research by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching . The university comprises 16 separate colleges and more than 110 centers , facilities , labs and institutes that offer more than 360 programs of study , including professional school programs . The university has an annual budget of over $ 1 @.@ 7 billion . Florida State is home to Florida 's only National Laboratory – the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory and is the birthplace of the commercially viable anti @-@ cancer drug Taxol . Florida State University also operates The John & Mable Ringling Museum of Art , the State Art Museum of Florida and one of the largest museum / university complexes in the nation . 
 The university is accredited by the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools ( SACS ) . Florida State University is home to nationally ranked programs in many academic areas , including law , business , engineering , medicine , social policy , film , music , theater , dance , visual art , political science , psychology , social work , and the sciences . Florida State University leads Florida in four of eight areas of external funding for the STEM disciplines ( Science , Technology , Engineering and Math ) . 
 FSU officially launched the " Raise the Torch : The Campaign for Florida State " on October 17 , 2014 . The campaign has a fundraising goal of more than $ 1 billion which will improve academics , research , and the overall student experience . As of May 31 , 2016 , Florida State University 's " Raise the Torch " campaign has raised $ 916 @,@ 925 @,@ 076 . 
 in 2016 , U.S. News & World Report ranked Florida State as the 43rd best public university in the United States . Florida Governor Rick Scott and the state legislature designated Florida State University as one of two " preeminent " state universities in the spring of 2013 among the twelve universities of the State University System of Florida . 
 FSU 's intercollegiate sports teams , commonly known by their " Florida State Seminoles " nickname , compete in National Collegiate Athletic Association ( NCAA ) Division I and the Atlantic Coast Conference ( ACC ) . In their 113 @-@ year history , Florida State 's varsity sports teams have won 20 national athletic championships and Seminole athletes have won 78 individual NCAA national championships . 
 = = History = = 
 In 1819 the Florida Territory was ceded to the United States by Spain as an element of the Adams – Onís Treaty . The Territory was conventionally split by the <unk> or later the Suwannee rivers into East and West areas . Florida State University is traceable to a plan set by the 1823 U.S. Congress to create a system of higher education . The 1838 Florida Constitution codified the basic system by providing for land allocated for the schools . In 1845 Florida became the 27th State of the United States , which permitted the resources and intent of the 1823 Congress regarding education in Florida to be implemented . In 1851 the Florida Legislature voted to establish two seminaries of higher education on opposite sides of the Suwannee River . Francis W. Eppes and other city leaders established an all @-@ male academy called the Florida Institute in Tallahassee as a legislative inducement to locate the West Florida Seminary in Tallahassee . The East Florida Seminary opened in Ocala in 1853 , closed in 1861 , and reopened in Gainesville in 1866 . The East Florida Seminary is the institution to which the modern University of Florida traces its foundation . 
 In 1856 , the land and buildings in an area formerly known as Gallows Hill , site of public executions in early Tallahassee , where the Florida Institute was built , was accepted as the site of the state seminary for male students . Two years later the institution absorbed the Tallahassee Female Academy founded in 1843 as the Misses Bates School and became coeducational . The West Florida Seminary stood near the front of the Westcott Building on the existing FSU campus , making this site the oldest continually used location of higher learning in Florida .

 In 1860 – 61 the legislature started formal military training at the school with a law amending the original 1851 statute . During the Civil War , the seminary became The Florida Military and Collegiate Institute . Enrollment at the school increased to around 250 students with the school establishing itself as perhaps the largest and most respected educational institution in the state . Cadets from the school defeated Union forces at the Battle of Natural Bridge in 1865 , leaving Tallahassee as the only Confederate capital east of the Mississippi River not to fall to Union forces . The students were trained by Valentine Mason Johnson , a graduate of Virginia Military Institute , who was a professor of mathematics and the chief administrator of the college . After the fall of the Confederacy , campus buildings were occupied by Union military forces for approximately four months and the West Florida Seminary reverted to its former academic purpose . In recognition of the cadets , and their pivotal role in the battle , the Florida State University Army ROTC cadet corps displays a battle streamer bearing the words " <unk> <unk> 1865 " with its flag . The FSU Army ROTC is one of only four collegiate military units in the United States with permission to display such a pennant .

 In February 1883 the West Florida Seminary became part of Florida University , the first state university in Florida . Under the new university charter , the seminary became the institution 's Literary College , and was to contain several " schools " or departments in different disciplines . However , in the new university association the seminary 's " separate Charter and special organization " were maintained . Florida University also incorporated the Tallahassee College of Medicine and Surgery , and recognized three more colleges to be established at a later date . The Florida Legislature recognized the university under the title " University of Florida " in Spring 1885 , but committed no additional financing or support . Without legislative support , the university project struggled . The institution never assumed the " university " title , and the association dissolved when the medical college relocated to Jacksonville later that year . However , the act recognizing the Tallahassee institution as the " University of Florida " was not repealed until 1903 , when the title was transferred to what had been the Florida Agricultural College . 
 However , the West Florida Seminary , as it was still generally called , continued to expand and thrive . It shifted its focus towards modern @-@ style post @-@ secondary education , awarding " <unk> of Instruction " , its first diplomas , in 1884 , and awarding Bachelor of Arts degrees in 1891 . It had become Florida 's first liberal arts college by 1897 , and in 1901 it was reorganized into the Florida State College with four departments ( the College , the College Academy , the School for Teachers and the School of Music ) .

 The 1905 Buckman Act , named after Henry Holland Buckman , reorganized the Florida college system into a school for white males ( University of the State of Florida ) , a school for white females ( Florida Female College later changed to Florida State College for Women ) , and a school for African Americans ( Florida Agricultural and Mechanical College for Negroes ) . The Buckman Act was controversial , as it changed the character of a historic coeducational state school into a school for women . An early and major benefactor of the school , James Westcott , Jr . ( 1839 – 1887 ) , willed substantial monies to the school to support continued operations . In 1911 his estate sued the state educational board contending the estate was not intended to support a single @-@ sex school . The Florida Supreme Court decided the issue in favor of the State of Florida stating the change in character ( existing from 1905 to 1947 ) was within the intent of the Westcott will . By 1933 the Florida State College for Women had grown to be the third largest women 's college in the United States and was the first state women 's college in the South to be awarded a chapter of Phi Beta Kappa , as well as the first university in Florida so honored . Florida State was the largest of the original two universities in Florida , even during the period as the college for women until 1919 . 
 Returning soldiers using the G.I. Bill after World War II stressed the state university system to the point that a Tallahassee Branch of the University of Florida ( <unk> ) was opened on the campus of the Florida State College for Women with the men housed in barracks on nearby Dale Mabry Field . By 1947 the Florida Legislature returned the <unk> to coeducational status and designated it the Florida State University . The FSU West Campus land and barracks plus other areas continually used as an airport later became the location of the Tallahassee Community College . The post @-@ war years brought substantial growth and development to the university as many departments and colleges were added including Business , Journalism ( discontinued in 1959 ) , Library Science , Nursing and Social Welfare . Strozier Library , Tully Gymnasium and the original parts of the Business building were also built at this time . 
 = = = Student activism = = = 
 During the 1960s and 1970s the Florida State University became a center for student activism especially in the areas of racial integration , women 's rights and opposition to the Vietnam War . The school acquired the nickname " Berkeley of the South " during this period , in reference to similar student activities at the University of California , Berkeley . The school is also purported to have originated the 1970s fad of " streaking " , said to have been first observed on Landis Green . 
 After many years as a segregated university , in 1962 Maxwell Courtney became the first African @-@ American undergraduate student admitted to Florida State . In 1968 Calvin Patterson became the first African American player for the Florida State University football team . Florida State today has the highest graduation rate for African American students of all universities in Florida . 
 On March 4 , 1969 the FSU chapter of Students for a Democratic Society , an unregistered university student organization , sought to use university facilities for meetings . The FSU administration , under President Stanley Marshall , subsequently decided not to allow the SDS the use of university property and obtained a court injunction to bar the group . The result was a protest and mass arrest at bayonet point of some 58 students in an incident later called the Night of the <unk> . The university Faculty Senate later criticized the administration 's response as provoking as an artificial crisis . Another notable event occurred when FSU students massed in protest of student deaths at Kent State University causing classes to be canceled . Approximately 1000 students marched to the ROTC building where they were confronted by police armed with shotguns and carbines . Joining the all @-@ night vigil , Governor Claude Kirk appeared unexpectedly with a wicker chair and spent hours , with little escort or fanfare , on Landis Green discussing politics with protesting students . 
 LGBTQ activism at FSU is unusual in that it was actually a fight against the school itself . The Pride Student Union ( PSU ) , originally <unk> , was founded in 1969 to represent LGBTQ students . In 1980 a gay male named William Wade won the title of Homecoming Princess under the pseudonym " Billy <unk> " causing controversy . In 2006 the Union Board added sexual orientation to its nondiscrimination policy causing several student organizations to be zero @-@ funded for noncompliance . Christian Legal Society had the senate to reverse the freezing after threatening a lawsuit which resulted in the founding of The Coalition for an Equitable Community ( CFEC ) to advocate for an inclusive nondiscrimination policy . In 2008 CFEC filed suit with the FSU Supreme Court against the Union Board for failing to uphold the policy though they ruled they lacked jurisdiction after hearing the case . In November 2009 CFEC placed an editorial in the FSView to provide perspective on the issue . In June 2010 the Board of Trustees passed a resolution protecting students based on sexual orientation , gender identity and gender expression . 
 In March 2002 , FSU students pitched " Tent City " on Landis Green for 114 days to compel the university to join the fledgling Worker 's Rights Consortium ( WRC ) . The Worker Rights Consortium ( WRC ) is an independent watchdog group that monitors labor rights worldwide . At the time , FSU earned 2 million dollars a year from merchandising rights . FSU administration initially refused to meet with the WRC , reportedly for fear of harming its relationship with Nike . At the outset of the protest 12 activists were arrested for setting up their tents outside the " free speech zone . " Tent City would reach a total of 50 tents throughout the hot , humid months of March , April , May , June , and July . The protest ended in July , when administration met student demands and met with the WRC .

 The Florida State University College of Medicine was created in June 2000 . It received provisional accreditation by the Liaison Committee on Medical Education on October 17 , 2002 , and full accreditation on February 3 , 2005 . 
 The King Life Sciences Building , which sits next to the College of Medicine , was completed in June 2008 , bringing all the biological sciences departments under one roof . 
 Following the creation of performance standards by the Florida state legislature in 2013 , Florida Governor Rick Scott and the Florida Board of Governors designated the Florida State University as one of the two " preeminent universities " among the twelve universities of the State University System of Florida . 
 Florida State 's new preeminent status and " Top 25 " ranking proposal calls for an increased state commitment of $ 75 million divided into $ 15 million increments over the next five years . The university would match , through philanthropy , the state 's commitment dollar for dollar with targeted investments in four areas : science , technology , engineering and math ( STEM ) initiatives , entrepreneurial programs , career preparation and increased retention and graduation rates . New efficiencies will add to the university 's potential to invest in quality .
