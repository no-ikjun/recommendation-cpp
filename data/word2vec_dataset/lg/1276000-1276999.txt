 Mushroom ketchup is a style of ketchup ( also spelled " catsup " ) that is prepared with mushrooms as its primary ingredient . Originally , ketchup in the United Kingdom was prepared with mushrooms as a primary ingredient , instead of tomato , the main ingredient in contemporary preparations . Historical preparations involved packing whole mushrooms into containers with salt . It is used as a condiment and may be used as an ingredient in the preparation of other sauces and other condiments . Several brands of mushroom ketchup were produced and marketed in the United Kingdom , some of which were exported to the United States , and Geo Watkins Mushroom Ketchup continues to exist in contemporary times as a commercially mass @-@ produced product . 
 = = History = = 
 In the United Kingdom , ketchup was historically made with mushrooms as a primary ingredient . The result was sometimes referred to as " mushroom ketchup " . In contemporary times , ketchup 's primary ingredient is typically tomato . Mushroom ketchup appears to have originated in Great Britain . In the United States , mushroom ketchup dates back to at least 1770 in English @-@ speaking colonies in North America . A manuscript cookbook from Charleston , South Carolina that was written in 1770 by Harriott Pinckney Horry documented a mushroom ketchup that used two egg whites to clarify the mixture . This manuscript also contained a recipe for walnut ketchup . Richard Briggs 's The English Art of Cookery , first published in 1788 , has recipes for both mushroom ketchup and walnut ketchup . 
 = = = Ingredients and preparation = = = 
 The preparation of mushroom ketchup involved packing whole mushrooms into containers with salt , allowing time for the liquid from the mushrooms to fill the container , and then cooking them to a boiling point in an oven . They were finished with spices such as mace , nutmeg and black pepper , and then the liquid was separated from solid matter by straining it . Several species of edible mushrooms were used in its preparation . Some versions used vinegar as an ingredient . The final product had a dark color that was derived from the mushroom spores that transferred from the mushrooms to the solution . The version in The English Art of Cookery calls for dried mushrooms to be used for the ketchup 's preparation . This version also uses red wine in the ketchup 's preparation , and uses a cooking reduction , in which one @-@ third of the product is reduced , after which the final product is bottled . 
 The book British Edible Fungi , published in 1891 , states that for optimal results , " mixed fungi should not be used , beyond certain limits ... " Per this source , some species of mushrooms may be mixed together in mushroom ketchup 's preparation , but certain species should not be mixed together , and some should not be mixed with others at all . This book also includes a preparation for " double ketchup " that involves reducing mushroom ketchup to half its original state , which doubles its strength through the evaporation of water . 
 In some instances in the late 19th century in the United States , ketchup sold in towns and labeled as " mushroom ketchup " did not actually contain mushrooms . These products have been described as " easy to detect " , and as distinguishable by the use of a microscope .

 = Harald Maddadsson = 
 Harald Maddadsson ( Old Norse : Haraldr Maddaðarson , Gaelic : Aralt mac <unk> ) ( c . 1134 – 1206 ) was Earl of Orkney and Mormaer of Caithness from 1139 until 1206 . He was the son of Matad , Mormaer of Atholl , and Margaret , daughter of Earl Haakon Paulsson of Orkney . Of mixed Norse and Gaelic blood , and a descendant of Scots kings , he was a significant figure in northern Scotland , and played a prominent part in Scottish politics of the twelfth century . The Orkneyinga Saga names him one of the three more powerful Earls of Orkney with Sigurd Eysteinsson and Thorfinn Sigurdsson . 
 = = Background = = 
 In the early twelfth century , the Earldom of Orkney , although weakened since the time of Earl Thorfinn , remained in control of Caithness and was dominant in Sutherland and parts of the Outer Hebrides . Thus the succession of the earldom was of great interest to the Scots king David I. The marriage of Matad and Margaret is believed to have taken place not long before 1134 , shortly following David 's suppression of a major revolt involving Mormaer Óengus of Moray , grandson of king Lulach , and Máel Coluim mac Alaxandair , the illegitimate son of David 's brother Alexander , and the subsequent extension of royal power into the provinces of Moray and Ross . David 's nephew William fitz Duncan was appointed to rule Moray , and it has been proposed that Matad , whose power lay in the Scottish kingdom 's heartland of Atholl , may also have been granted authority in the new lands north of the Mounth , and that his marriage to <unk> <unk> was arranged with this in mind . 
 Harald Maddadsson was born shortly before Rognvald Kali Kolsson took control of the Earldom of Orkney , on the disappearance of Earl Paul Haakonsson . The Orkneyinga Saga reports the official tale , that Paul had abdicated , and the rumour that he was killed on the orders of Harald 's mother . Earl Paul had not been well loved by his female kin . His mother and her sister , Frakkok , had previously tried to murder him with a poisoned shirt which instead caused the death of his brother Harald Haakonsson . Rognvald represented the pro @-@ Norwegian faction in the Earldom . It is said that Frakkok and her supporters had originally intended to advance the claims of Harald Haakon 's son Erlend on Paul 's death . However , Matad and Margaret , with King David backing them , imposed the infant Harald Maddadson as joint ruler with Rognvald . 
 = = Early years = = 
 The main threat to Harald Maddadsson and Rognvald Kali came from Erlend Haraldsson , especially from Erlend 's supporter Frakkok . The old conspirator , however , was soon disposed of , burned to death in her hall near Helmsdale . The Orkneyinga Saga names Svein Asleifsson as the killer , and says that he came to Caithness from the south , from Atholl , with Rognvald 's blessing and Matad 's help . This Svein Asleifsson had also been the man in whose custody Earl Paul had disappeared . 
 In Harald 's early years , when power was exercised jointly with Rognvald on his behalf by councillors chosen by King David , Orkney enjoyed relative stability , although the Saga contains the usual killings and burnings of the time , including the death of an Earl <unk> who is otherwise unknown . In 1150 or 1151 , Harald visited Norway with Earl Rognvald , and probably met with King Ingi Haraldsson . During this visit Rognvald made his decision to go on crusade , as recounted at length in the Saga . 
 = = = Earls Rognvald , Harald and Erlend = = = 
 After Harald returned to Orkney and Rognvald departed on his expedition , King Eystein Haraldsson , eldest brother of Ingi , undertook a raiding expedition from Norway against the Earldom of Orkney . During this operation he encountered Harald near Thurso and captured him . Harald was freed in return for a ransom in gold and by giving his oath to Eystein . Eystein then went on to raid the coasts of Scotland and England . 
 Possibly as a result of Eystein 's activities , King David granted half of Caithness to Harald 's cousin , Erlend Haraldsson . The result , as recounted in the Orkneyinga Saga , was a political struggle which ended with Erlend 's murder in 1154 . Rognvald too was killed , in 1158 . Svein Asleifsson was again heavily involved in this dynastic conflict . In 1153 King David died , to be succeeded by his young grandson , Malcolm IV . King Eystein too died in a war with his brothers Ingi and Sigurd which left Ingi the sole surviving son of Harald Gilli . As a result , by 1158 Harald Maddadsson was undisputed Earl of Orkney , with neither the King of Scots nor the King of Norway in any position to contest his power . 
 = = Earl Harald and the kings ' enemies = = 
 From the death of Rognvald , Harald Maddadsson pursued a policy of supporting the enemies of the kings of Scotland , first Malcolm IV , who died young in 1165 , then Malcolm 's brother William . Of these enemies , those who were active in the north and west , where Harald 's power was significant , were Somerled , king of Argyll and Hebrides ( who married earl Harold 's first cousin Ragnhild of the Isle of Man ) , the sons of Máel Coluim mac Alasdair , illegitimate son of King Alexander I , himself held prisoner at Roxburgh , the Meic Uilleim , the descendants of William fitz Duncan , and the <unk> and dispossessed would @-@ be Mormaers of Ross ( who possibly were a branch of the ancient Loairn dynasty of Moray and claimants of its rights ) . 
 An expedition to Ross by King William and his brother Earl David in 1179 may have been related to Harald 's activities . Two years later the rebellion of Domnall , son of Máel Coluim mac Uilleim , broke out in Ross and Moray , and it is presumed that Earl Harald played a part in this . The rebellion was not finally suppressed until 1187 . 
 The defeat of Domnall 's rebellion led to more conflict between Earl Harald and King William . After 1187 , it appears that Scots and Scotto @-@ Norman nobles were being planted in Ross and in Cromarty , as had previously happened in Moray . The de Moravia family , anglicised as Moray or Murray , which later produced Andrew Moray , were granted lands in Ross and Cromarty , and they are unlikely to have been unique in this award . When King William fell ill in 1195 , this may have been the catalyst for the final conflict with Harald , which lasted from 1197 until 1201 . As part of this struggle , William granted lands in Caithness to Harald the Young , grandson of Rognvald Kali , in 1197 . Harald the Young was killed by Harald Maddadsson the following year . 
 The Orkneyinga Saga states that King William called upon the King of Mann , Ragnald <unk> , to fight against Harald . Rognvald had possibly spuriously claims to Harald 's lands , because people remembered that Harald 's mother was younger daughter of earl Haakon Paulsson , whereas the elder daughter had married the king of Isle of Man ( although Ragnald 's father Godfrey of Man had been that lady 's stepson and not her own son ) . Harald , however , retook Caithness at this time . In this campaign , dated to 1201 , the Saga tells that Harald came to the stronghold of Bishop John of Caithness , at Scrabster . Bishop John went to meet Harald , apparently to greet him , but the Earl had him seized , tortured and mutilated . The Gesta Annalia reports that Harald tormented Bishop John in this way because he believed that John was an informant set on making trouble between Harald and King William . 
 The creation of John 's see of Caithness in 1189 – 1190 was undoubtedly intended to extend Scots authority in the region . The new bishopric was not uncontroversial and John soon came into conflict with Harald Maddadson and the Bishop of Orkney , Bjarni <unk> . The conflict , presented as a dispute over the collection of monies for the papacy ( a form of Peter 's pence ) , was appealed to Pope Innocent III , who wrote to Bishop Bjarni and the Bishop of Rosemarkie ( or Ross ) to prevent John from interfering with the collection . 
 King William , using the treatment of Bishop John as a cause for war with Harald , brought a large army north in 1201 – 1202 . The army , it is said , was so large that Harald capitulated without a fight and agreed to give a quarter of the revenues of Caithness to William . During this time , Earl Harald 's son Thorfinn was captured by the Scots . Whether in revenge for the treatment of Bishop John , or to cow Harald , or because Thorfinn may have had some claim to the throne through his mother ( the lady of Moray ) , he was blinded and castrated , dying soon later in prison . 
 Harald Maddadson also faced troubles with the Norwegian king . Orkney and Shetland warriors ( Øyskjeggs ) , led by Harald 's brother @-@ in @-@ law Olaf fought on behalf of Sigurd Magnusson against King Sverre Sigurdsson . Sigurd Magnusson was the son of former King Magnus V of Norway and pretender to the throne of King Sverre . Olaf was joined by <unk> Jonsson , who had been a son @-@ in law of Norwegian earl Erling <unk> as well as the brother @-@ in @-@ law of King Magnus V. King Sverre and his force confronted the Øyskjeggs in the spring of 1194 , when the two fleets met at Florvåg on Askøy , an island just north of Bergen , Norway . In the Battle of Florvåg on 3 April 1194 , the experience of the Norwegian veterans proved to be decisive . King Sverre won and both Sigurd Magnusson and <unk> Jonsson fell with most of their men . King Sverre appears to have believed that Harald Maddadson was involved in the affair . After the Battle of Florvåg , King Sverre punished Harald by seizing Shetland , which was never returned in his lifetime . 
 In 1202 Pope Innocent , persuaded that Harald was not personally responsible for the abuse of Bishop John , wrote to Bishop Bjarni to order him to ensure that Harald 's man <unk> , who was blamed for the deeds , was suitably punished . With this , the story of Harald 's turbulent life reaches its close . He died of natural causes in 1206 after a long and eventful reign of 65 years , aged about 72 . 
 = = The <unk> = = 
 Harald 's first wife was named <unk> , a Gaelic name shared with a daughter of Fergus of Galloway . They had four children together whom the Orkneyinga Saga names as <unk> , Haakon , Helena and Margaret . 
 The second wife of Earl Harald , the Orkneyinga Saga says , was Hvarflod ( <unk> called Gormflaith in some literature ) , daughter of " Earl Máel Coluim of Moray " , whom he married around 1168 , and with her he had six children : Thorfinn , David , Jon , Gunnhild , <unk> and <unk> . Hvarflod 's father is presumed to have been Máel Coluim mac <unk> ( possibly an heir of the Moray / Loairn dynasty 's rights ) , so that her sons , and it may be that she was the mother of Thorfinn alone of Harald 's sons , would carry on the old rival claims to the Scots throne . It appears that King William demanded that Harald repudiate Hvarflod as a condition of peace between them . Of the surviving <unk> , David and Jon were joint Earls of Orkney on their father 's death , while <unk> ( Eanric mac Arailt mac <unk> ) ruled Ross . Nothing more is known of <unk> and Earl David Haraldsson died of sickness in 1214 , leaving Jon to rule alone until 1231 . 
 In 1222 Earl Jon was implicated , indirectly , in the burning of Bishop Adam of Caithness in his hall at Halkirk by local farmers . Jon was accused of looking on or of fomenting the discontent . King Alexander II undertook harsh reprisals for the killing , to the satisfaction of Pope Honorius III . The writer of the Orkneyinga Saga <unk> " The punishments by Alexander for the burning of the bishop , by mutilation and death , confiscation and outlawry from the land , are still in fresh memory " . 
 Jon Haraldsson was killed in 1231 , at Thurso in Caithness . He was contested by <unk> <unk> , a great @-@ grandson of Rognvald Kali , who had demanded that Jon should share the Earldom with him , as had been done before . Jon 's supporters and <unk> 's fought a war until it was agreed that King Haakon <unk> should settle the matter . All concerned set off to Norway , but a ship carrying Earl Jon , his supporters , and his kin , was lost at sea on the return voyage . As a result , the line of Norse Earls came to a temporary end and from 1231 until 1236 Orkney was without an Earl . In 1236 the Earldom was granted by Haakon IV of Norway , to Magnus , son of Gille Brigte , Mormaer of Angus . Although ruled by Angus , Strathearn and Sinclair lords thereafter , Orkney remained part of the kingdom of Norway . 
 = Volvopluteus gloiocephalus = 
 Volvopluteus gloiocephalus , commonly known as the big sheath mushroom , rose @-@ gilled grisette , or stubble rosegill , is a species of mushroom in the family Pluteaceae . For most of the 20th century it has been known under the names Volvariella gloiocephala or Volvariella speciosa , but recent molecular studies have placed it as the type species of the genus Volvopluteus , newly created in 2011 . The cap of this mushroom is about 5 – 15 cm ( 2 – 6 in ) in diameter , varies from white to grey or grey @-@ brown , and is markedly sticky when fresh . The gills start out as white but they soon turn pink . The stipe is white and has a sack @-@ like volva at the base . Microscopical features and DNA sequence data are of great importance for separating V. gloiocephalus from related species . V. gloiocephalus is a saprotrophic fungus that grows on grassy fields and accumulations of organic matter like compost or woodchips piles . It has been reported from all continents except Antarctica . 
 = = Taxonomy = = 
 This taxon has a long and convoluted nomenclatural history . It was originally described as Agaricus gloiocephalus by Swiss botanist Augustin Pyramus de Candolle in 1815 and later sanctioned under this name by Elias Magnus Fries in 1821 . The French mycologist Claude Gillet transferred it in 1878 to the genus Volvaria erected by Paul Kummer just a few years earlier in 1871 . The name Volvaria was already taken , as it had been coined by De Candolle for a genus of lichens in 1805 . The generic name Volvariella , proposed by the Argentinean mycologist Carlos Luis Spegazzini in 1899 , would eventually be adopted for this group in 1953 after a proposal to conserve Kummer ’ s Volvaria against De Candolle ’ s Volvaria was rejected by the Nomenclature Committee for Fungi established under the principles of the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature . 
 Despite the generic name Volvariella being adopted in 1953 the name Volvariella gloiocephala did not exist until 1986 , when the placement of the species in that genus was formally proposed by mycologists <unk> Boekhout and Manfred Enderle . The reason for this long interval is that most 20th @-@ century mycologists working on Volvariella ( e.g. Rolf Singer , Robert L. Shaffer , Robert Kühner , Henri Romagnesi ) considered the epithet " gloiocephalus " to represent a variety with dark basidiocarps of another species of Volvariella , viz . Volvariella speciosa , that has white basidiocarps , and therefore would use the name Volvariella speciosa var. gloiocephala to refer to this taxon . Boekhout & Enderle showed that white and dark basidiocarps can arise from the same mycelium , and that the epithets " gloiocephalus " proposed by De Candolle in 1815 and " speciosa " proposed by Fries in 1818 should be considered to represent the same species with the former having nomenclatural priority . In 1996 Boekhout and Enderle designated a neotype to serve as a representative example of the species . 
 The phylogenetic study of Justo and colleagues showed that Volvariella gloiocephala and related taxa are a separate clade from the majority of the species traditionally classified in Volvariella and therefore another name change was necessary , now as the type species of the newly proposed genus Volvopluteus . 
 The epithet gloiocephalus comes from the Greek terms <unk> ( <unk> 
 = glue or glutinous substance ) and <unk> ( <unk> = 
 head ) meaning " with a sticky head " making reference to the viscid cap surface . It is commonly known as the " big sheath mushroom " , " rose @-@ gilled grisette " or the " stubble rosegill " . 
 = = Description = = 
 The cap of Volvopluteus gloiocephalus is between 5 and 15 cm ( 2 @.@ 0 and 5 @.@ 9 in ) in diameter , more or less ovate or conical when young , then expands to convex or flat , sometimes with a slight central depression in old specimens . The surface is markedly viscid in fresh basidiocarps ; the color ranges from pure white to grey or greyish @-@ brown . The gills are crowded , free from the stipe , ventricose ( swollen in the middle ) , and up to 2 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 in ) broad ; they are white when young but turn pink with age . The stipe is 8 – 22 @.@ 5 cm ( 3 @.@ 1 – 8 @.@ 9 in ) long and 0 @.@ 7 – 1 @.@ 5 cm ( 0 @.@ 3 – 0 @.@ 6 in ) wide , cylindrical , broadening towards the base ; the surface is white , smooth or slightly pruinose ( covered with fine white powdery granules ) . The volva is 2 – 3 cm ( 0 @.@ 8 – 1 @.@ 2 in ) high , <unk> ( pouch @-@ like ) , white and has a smooth surface . The flesh is white on stipe and cap and it does not change when bruised or exposed to air . Smell and taste vary from indistinct to <unk> ( radish @-@ like ) or similar to raw peeled potatoes . The spore print is pinkish @-@ brown . 
 The basidiospores are ellipsoid and measure 12 – 16 by 8 – 9 @.@ 5 µm . Basidia are 20 – 35 by 7 – 15 µm and usually four @-@ spored , but sometimes two @-@ spored basidia can occur . Pleurocystidia are 60 – 90 by 20 – 50 µm with variable morphology : club @-@ shaped , fusiform , ovoid , and sometimes with a small apical papilla . Cheilocystidia are 55 – 100 by 15 – 40 µm with similar morphology to the pleurocystidia ; they completely cover the gill edge . The cap cuticle ( pileipellis ) is an ixocutis ( parallel hyphae wide embedded in a gelatinous matrix ) . <unk> is a cutis ( parallel hyphae not embedded in a gelatinous matrix ) . Caulocystidia are sometimes present , measuring 70 – 180 by 10 – 25 µm ; they are mostly cylindrical . Clamp connections are absent from the hyphae . 
 = = = Edibility = = = 
 Volvopluteus gloiocephalus is edible , although it is cited as mediocre or of poor quality . It was once sold in markets in Perth , Australia . Mature fruit bodies , collected in sufficient quantity , can be used to prepare soup , or added to dishes where wild mushrooms are used , such as stews and casseroles . The mushrooms are best used fresh as they do not preserve well . Young specimens of Volvopluteus gloiocephalus have white gills so it is possible to mistake them for an Amanita and vice versa . In the United States , there have been several cases of Asian immigrants collecting and eating death caps ( Amanita phalloides ) , under the mistaken assumption that they were Volvariella . A Greek study determined the nutritional composition of fruit bodies : protein 1 @.@ 49 g / 100 g fresh weight ( fw ) , 18 @.@ 36 g / 100 g dry weight ( dw ) ; fat 0 @.@ 54 g / 100 g fw , 6 @.@ 65 g / 100g dw ; carbohydrates 5 @.@ 33 g / 100g fw , 65 @.@ 64 g / 100 g dw . 
 = = = Similar species = = = 
 Molecular analyses of the internal transcribed spacer region clearly separate the four species currently recognized in Volvopluteus , but morphological identification can be more difficult due to the sometimes overlapping morphological variation among the species . Size of the fruit bodies , color of the cap , spore size , presence or absence of cystidia and morphology of the cystidia are the most important characters for morphological species delimitation in the genus . V. earlei has smaller fruit bodies ( cap less than 5 cm ( 2 in ) in diameter ) , has no pleurocystidia ( usually ) , and the cheilocystidia usually have a very long apical excrescence ( outgrowth ) . In V. asiaticus the majority of the pleurocystidia have an apical excrescence up to 10 – 15 µm long and the cheilocystidia are predominantly lageniform ( flask @-@ shaped ) . V. michiganensis has smaller basidiospores , on average less than 12 @.@ 5 µm long . Volvariella <unk> , known from central Africa ( Zaire ) and Italy , somewhat resembles Volvopluteus gloiocephalus . It can be distinguished from the latter by its smaller fruit bodies , with caps up to 3 cm ( 1 @.@ 2 in ) in diameter , and , microscopically , by the complete absence of cheilo- and pleurocystidia . 
 = = Ecology , habitat , and distribution = = 
 Volvopluteus <unk> is a saprotrophic mushroom that grows on the ground in gardens , grassy fields , both in and outside forest areas , and on accumulations of vegetable matter like compost or woodchips piles . It has also been reported fruiting in greenhouses . It usually fruits in groups of several basidiocarps but it can also be found growing solitary . In China it grows in bamboo thickets . It is not unusual for a season of " spectacular " fruiting to be followed by several years with no appearance of the mushroom . 
 This species has been reported from all continents except Antarctica , usually under names such as Volvariella gloiocephala or Volvariella speciosa . Molecular data have so far corroborated its occurrence in Europe and North America but records from other continents remain to be confirmed . 
 = Halo : First Strike = 
 Halo : First Strike is a military science fiction novel by Eric Nylund , based on the Halo series of video games . The book was released in December 2003 and is the third Halo novel ; Nylund 's second contribution to the series . The novel serves as a bridge between the events of the games Halo : Combat Evolved and its 2004 sequel Halo 2 . First Strike was also released as an audiobook , narrated by Todd McLaren . 
 Halo : First Strike opens with the arrival of the Covenant armada at the human stronghold planet of Reach . The book follows both the unsuccessful attempt to defend Reach by the SPARTAN @-@ IIs who were on the planet 's surface and the adventures of the rag @-@ tag survivors of the battle at Alpha Halo . The book also reveals that humanity 's worst fear is going to come true : the Covenant is on its way to Earth . The book was well received by critics and sold well , making The New York Times Best Seller list . Critics found it added depth to the Halo video games and that it was exciting throughout . 
 = = Background = = 
 First Strike was Nylund 's second Halo novel after his task of writing the prequel to the first game , 2001 's Halo : The Fall of Reach . Nylund said in an interview that he wrote the book within sixteen weeks , a much longer deadline than the seven weeks he had to complete The Fall of Reach . However , due to more Halo canon already being published Nylund found it harder to write First Strike into the existing story ; " There were more events and characters to link and keep track of … timelines to sync up … like threading three needles at once with one hand . " To write a better novel than The Fall of Reach , Nylund read military combat manuals and biographies of soldiers , he also tried to improve where fans had criticized the first Halo book .

 = = = Setting = = = 
 First Strike takes place in the 26th century , where humanity , under the governance of the United Nations Space Command ( UNSC ) , has been fighting a losing war against a religious collective of alien races known as the Covenant . Humanity 's best defense against the Covenant is the SPARTAN Project , super @-@ soldiers in powered armor , but these elite troops are too few to turn the tide of war in the UNSC 's favor . Following a Covenant attack on Reach , a planet within UNSC jurisdiction , the Pillar of Autumn flees randomly coming across an ancient installation built by the mysterious Forerunner . The Covenant call this relic Halo , and believe it is a weapon and means of transcendence . UNSC discover that Halo is in fact a method of containing a parasite known as the Flood , by destroying all sentient life to prevent the Flood from spreading beyond Halo . The SPARTAN Master Chief and his artificial intelligence companion , Cortana , detonate the Pillar of Autumn 's engines , destroying Halo . Escaping the destruction via a fighter , the Chief and Cortana believe themselves the only survivors of the catastrophe . 
 = = = Plot = = = 
 The novel begins in orbit above planet Reach , as humanity fights the Covenant invasion forces . The last line of defense for the planet is an array of magnetic accelerator cannons ( <unk> ) orbiting the planet . The Master Chief sends a team of Spartans to the surface of Reach to protect the MAC 's planet @-@ based power generators . Ultimately , the Covenant are able to destroy the generators and begin <unk> the planet , melting its surface to glass . The surviving Spartans flee underground to the hidden headquarters of the Office of Naval Intelligence . There they meet Dr. Halsey who , with help of some of the surviving Spartans , uncovers a strange crystalline shard in a cavern built by the ancient Forerunner . Pursued by the Covenant , the Spartans retrieve the shard and collapse the passage behind them , which saves them from the pursuing Covenant forces , but also traps them deep under the surface of Reach . 
 The book then shifts to events occurring soon after Halo , as the Master Chief and Cortana drift through the ruins of Halo , they discover other survivors including Sergeant Johnson and Corporal Locklear . The group commandeer the Covenant flagship Ascendant Justice and use its slipspace capabilities to return to the Reach system . To prevent the Covenant finding Earth with a tracking device , the humans plan to find a suitably undamaged human ship to take them to Earth . Upon arrival the group receive a radio signal used by the Spartans in their training days . On the surface , they find three Spartans and Vice Admiral Danforth Whitcomb , the Deputy Chief of Naval Operations . The Vice Admiral arms a " Nova thermonuclear mine " , a weapon that would destroy the planet . The Master Chief and his newly acquired team of Spartans then proceed to rescue Dr. Halsey and the other Spartans that were trapped under the surface of the planet . Meanwhile , Cortana , still aboard Ascendant Justice , learns that the Covenant already know the location of Earth and are preparing an invasion fleet .

 Upon release , First Strike was a critical and commercial success , being the first Halo novel to make The New York Times bestsellers list . IGN stated that the writing was " terse and exciting " and that players waiting for the release of Halo 2 could pick up interesting hints about what was to come in the game and in the ilovebees viral marketing campaign . About.com 's Eric Qualls stated that First Strike and the other Halo novels " make you appreciate Halo and Halo 2 a hundred times more " , and strongly recommended that fans of the game pick up the novel . Shawn of Digital Monkey Box criticized the way the Nylund sidelines characters who were developed early in the book as the Master Chief takes precedence but overall praised the book highly . Nylund 's character development and the ethical challenges presented to the Master Chief were praised however and reviewer Josh Carter considered it superior to either of the previous books . When Phil Jones reviewed the book for Science Fiction Crowsnest he found that " the combat does get somewhat tiresome " but concluded that the book was a good , easy read and " as spin @-@ offs go , it 's not bad . " The First Strike audiobook was also well received , reviewer Cliff <unk> commenting that " Todd McLaren did a good job narrating " , as well as finding it to be " an exciting story throughout . " 
 Various sources of sharia are used by Islamic jurisprudence to elucidate the body of Islamic law . The primary sources , accepted universally by all Muslims , are the Qur 'an and Sunnah . The Qur 'an is the holy scripture of Islam , believed by Muslims to be the direct and unaltered word of God . The Sunnah consists of the religious actions and quotations of the Islamic prophet Muhammad and narrated through his Companions and the Imams ( per the beliefs of the Sunni and Shi 'ite schools respectively ) . 
 As Islamic regulations stated in the primary sources do not explicitly deal with every conceivable eventuality , jurisprudence must refer to resources and authentic documents to find the correct course of action . According to Sunni schools of law , secondary sources of Islamic law are consensus , the exact nature of which bears no consensus itself ; analogical reason ; pure reason ; seeking the public interest ; juristic discretion ; the rulings of the first generation of Muslims ; and local customs . Hanafi school frequently relies on analogical deduction and independent reasoning , and Maliki and Hanbali generally use the Hadith instead . Shafi 'i school uses Sunnah more than Hanafi and analogy more than two others . Among Shia , <unk> school of Ja <unk> jurisprudence uses four sources , which are Qur 'an , Sunnah , consensus and the intellect . They use consensus under special conditions and rely on the intellect to find general principles based on the Qur 'an and Sunnah , and use the principles of jurisprudence as a methodology to interpret the Qur 'an and Sunnah in different circumstances . <unk> Ja <unk> rely more on tradition and reject ijtihad . According to Momen , despite considerable differences in the principles of jurisprudence between Shia and the four Sunni schools of law , there are fewer differences in the practical application of jurisprudence to ritual observances and social transactions . 
 = = = Qur ’ an = = = 
 The Qur 'an is the first and most important source of Islamic law . Believed to be the direct word of God as revealed to Muhammad through angel Gabriel in Mecca and Medina , the scripture specifies the moral , philosophical , social , political and economic basis on which a society should be constructed . The verses revealed in Mecca deal with philosophical and theological issues , whereas those revealed in Medina are concerned with socio @-@ economic laws . The Qur 'an was written and preserved during the life of Muhammad , and compiled soon after his death . 
 The verses of the Qur 'an are categorized into three fields : " science of speculative theology " , " ethical principles " and " rules of human conduct " . The third category is directly concerned with Islamic legal matters which contains about five hundred verses or one thirteenth of it . The task of interpreting the Qur 'an has led to various opinions and judgments . The interpretations of the verses by Muhammad 's companions for Sunnis and Imams for Shias are considered the most authentic , since they knew why , where and on what occasion each verse was revealed . 
 = = = Sunnah = = = 
 The Sunnah is the next important source , and is commonly defined as " the traditions and customs of Muhammad " or " the words , actions and silent assertions of him " . It includes the everyday sayings and utterances of Muhammad , his acts , his tacit consent , and acknowledgments of statements and activities . According to Shi 'ite jurists , the sunnah also includes the words , deeds and acknowledgments of the twelve Imams and Fatimah , Muhammad 's daughter , who are believed to be infallible . 
 Justification for using the Sunnah as a source of law can be found in the Qur 'an . The Qur 'an commands Muslims to follow Muhammad . During his lifetime , Muhammad made it clear that his traditions ( along with the Qur 'an ) should be followed after his death . The overwhelming majority of Muslims consider the sunnah to be essential supplements to and clarifications of the Qur 'an . In Islamic jurisprudence , the Qur 'an contains many rules for the behavior expected of Muslims but there are no specific Qur 'anic rules on many religious and practical matters . Muslims believe that they can look at the way of life , or sunnah , of Muhammad and his companions to discover what to imitate and what to avoid . 
 Much of the sunnah is recorded in the Hadith . Initially , Muhammad had instructed his followers not to write down his acts , so they may not confuse it with the Qur 'an . However , he did ask his followers to disseminate his sayings orally . As long as he was alive , any doubtful record could be confirmed as true or false by simply asking him . His death , however , gave rise to confusion over Muhammad 's conduct . Thus the Hadith were established . Due to problems of authenticity , the science of Hadith ( Arabic : <unk> al @-@ hadith ) is established . It is a method of textual criticism developed by early Muslim scholars in determining the veracity of reports attributed to Muhammad . This is achieved by analyzing the text of the report , the scale of the report 's transmission , the routes through which the report was transmitted , and the individual narrators involved in its transmission . On the basis of these criteria , various Hadith classifications developed . 
 To establish the authenticity of a particular Hadith or report , it had to be checked by following the chain of transmission ( <unk> ) . Thus the reporters had to cite their reference , and their reference 's reference all the way back to Muhammad . All the references in the chain had to have a reputation for honesty and possessing a good retentive memory . Thus biographical analysis ( <unk> al @-@ <unk> , lit . " science of people " ) , which contains details about the transmitter are scrutinized . This includes analyzing their date and place of birth ; familial connections ; teachers and students ; religiosity ; moral behaviour ; literary output ; their travels ; as well as their date of death . Based upon these criteria , the reliability ( <unk> ) of the transmitter is assessed . Also determined is whether the individual was actually able to transmit the report , which is deduced from their <unk> and geographical proximity with the other transmitters in the chain . Examples of biographical dictionaries include Ibn Hajar al @-@ Asqalani 's " <unk> al @-@ <unk> " or al @-@ <unk> 's " <unk> al @-@ <unk> . " 
 Using this criterion , Hadith are classified into three categories : 
 <unk> ( <unk> ) , which are very widely known , and backed up by numerous references . 
 Widespread ( <unk> ) , which are widely known , but backed up with few original references . 
 Isolated or Single ( <unk> ) , which are backed up by too few and often discontinuous references . 
 in a <unk> court a qadi ( judge ) hears a case , including witnesses and evidence . then the qadi makes a ruling . sometimes the qadi consults a mufti or scholar of law , for an opinion . 
 = = = Consensus = = = 
 also called <unk> 
 The ijma ' , or consensus amongst Muslim jurists on a particular legal issue , constitutes the third source of Islamic law . Muslim jurists provide many verses of the Qur 'an that legitimize ijma ' as a source of legislation . Muhammad himself said : 
 " My followers will never agree upon an error or what is wrong " , 
 " God 's hand is with the entire community " . 
 In history , it has been the most important factor in defining the meaning of the other sources and thus in formulating the doctrine and practice of the Muslim community . This is so because ijma ' represents the unanimous agreement of Muslims on a regulation or law at any given time . 
 There are various views on ijma ' among Muslims . Sunni jurists consider ijma ' as a source , in matters of legislation , as important as the Qur 'an and Sunnah . Shiite jurists , however , consider ijma ' as source of secondary importance , and a source that is , unlike the Qur 'an and Sunnah , not free from error . <unk> ' was always used to refer to agreement reached in the past , either remote or near . Amongst the Sunni jurists there is diversity on who is eligible to participate in ijma ' , as shown in the following table : 
 In modern Muslim usage it is no longer associated with traditional authority and appears as democratic institution and an instrument of reform . 
 = = = Analogical reason = = = 
 <unk> or analogical reason is the fourth source of the sharia for the majority of Sunni jurisprudence . It aims to draw analogies to a previously accepted decision . Shiites do not accept analogy , but replace it with reason ( <unk> ) ; among Sunnis , the <unk> have traditionally been reluctant to accept analogy while the <unk> don 't accept it at all . Analogical reason in Islam is the process of legal deduction according to which the jurist , confronted with an unprecedented case , bases his or her argument on the logic used in the Qur 'an and Sunnah . Legally sound analogy must not be based on arbitrary judgment , but rather be firmly rooted in the primary sources . 
 Supporters of the practice of qiyas will often point to passages in the Qur 'an that describe an application of a similar process by past Islamic communities . According to supporters of the practice , Muhammad said : " Where there is no revealed injunction , I will judge amongst you according to reason . " Further , supporters claim that he extended the right to reason to others . Finally , supporters of the practice claim that it is sanctioned by the ijma , or consensus , amongst Muhammad 's companions . Islamic studies scholar Bernard G. Weiss has pointed out that while analogical reason was accepted as a fourth source of law by later generations , its validity was not a foregone conclusion among earlier Muslim jurists . Thus the issue of analogical reason and its validity was a controversial one early on , though the practice eventually gained acceptance of the majority of Sunni jurists . 
 The success and expansion of Islam brought it into contact with different cultures , societies and traditions , such as those of Byzantines and Persians . With such contact , new problems emerged for Islamic law to tackle . Moreover , there was a significant distance between Medina , the Islamic capital , and the Muslims on the periphery on the Islamic state . Thus far off jurists had to find novel Islamic solutions without the close supervision of the hub of Islamic law ( back in Medina ) . During the Umayyad dynasty , the concept of qiyas was abused by the rulers . The Abbasids , who succeeded the Umayyads defined it more strictly , in an attempt to apply it more consistently . 
 The general principle behind the process of qiyas is based on the understanding that every legal injunction guarantees a beneficial and welfare satisfying objective . Thus , if the cause of an injunction can be deduced from the primary sources , then analogical deduction can be applied to cases with similar causes . For example , wine is prohibited in Islam because of its intoxicating property . Thus qiyas leads to the conclusion that all intoxicants are forbidden . 
 The Hanafi school of thought very strongly supports qiyas . Imam Abu Hanifa , an important practitioner of qiyas , elevated qiyas to a position of great significance in Islamic law . Abu Hanifa extended the rigid principle of basing rulings on the Qur 'an and Sunnah to incorporate opinion and exercise of free thought by jurists . In order to respond suitably to emerging problems , he based his judgments , like other jurists , on the explicit meanings of primary texts ( the Qur 'an and sunnah ) . But , he also considered the " spirit " of Islamic teachings , as well as whether the ruling would be in the interest of the objectives of Islam . Such rulings were based on public interest and the welfare of the Muslim community . 
 The Shafi 'i school of thought accepts qiyas as a valid source . Imam Shafi 'i , however , considered it a weak source , and tried to limit the cases where jurists would need to resort to qiyas . He criticized and rejected analogical deductions that were not firmly rooted in the Qur 'an and sunnah . According to Shafi 'i , if analogical deductions were not strictly rooted in primary sources , they would have adverse effects . One such consequence could be variety of different rulings in the same subject . Such a situation , he argued , would undermine the predictability and uniformity of a sound legal system . 
 Imam Malik accepted qiyas as a valid source of legislation . For him , if a parallel could be established between the effective cause of a law in the primary sources and a new case , then analogical deduction could be viable tool . Malik , however , went beyond his adherence to " strict analogy " and proposed pronouncements on the basis of what jurists considered was " public good " . 
 = = = <unk> discretion = = = 
 Abu Hanifa developed a new source known as juristic discretion . <unk> discretion is defined as : 
 A means to seek ease and convenience , 
 To adopt tolerance and moderation , 
 To over @-@ rule analogical reason , if necessary . 
 The source , inspired by the principle of conscience , is a last resort if none of the widely accepted sources are applicable to a problem . It involves giving favor to rulings that dispel hardship and bring ease to people . The doctrine was justified directly by the Qur 'anic verse stating : " Allah desires you ease and good , not hardship " . Though its main adherents were Abu Hanifa and his pupils ( such as Abu Yusuf ) , Malik and his students made use of it to some degree . The source was subject to extensive discussion and argumentation , and its opponents claimed that it often departs from the primary sources . 
 This doctrine was useful in the Islamic world outside the Middle East where the Muslims encountered environments and challenges they had been unfamiliar with in Arabia . One example of <unk> is cited as follows : If a well is contaminated it may not be used for ritual purification . <unk> suggests that withdrawing a certain number of buckets of water from the well will remove the impurities . Analogical reason , however , dictates that despite removing some of the water , a small concentration of contaminants will always remain in the well ( or the well walls ) rendering the well impure . The application of analogy means the public may not use the well , and therefore causes hardship . Thus the principle of <unk> discretion is applied , and the public may use the well for ritual purification . 
 = = = Public interest = = = 
 Malik developed a tertiary source called al @-@ <unk> al @-@ <unk> , which means that which is in the best interests of the general public . According to this source of Islamic law , rulings can be pronounced in accordance with the " underlying meaning of the revealed text in the light of public interest " . In this case , the jurist uses his wisdom to pursue public interest . This source is rejected by the Shafi 'ites , <unk> and <unk> from Sunni jurisprudence . 
 = = = Inference = = = 
 Shafi 'i accepted cases in which he had to be more flexible with the application of Qisas . Similar to Abu Hanifa and Malik , he developed a tertiary source of legislation . The Shafi 'i school adopted <unk> or inference , a process of seeking guidance from the source . Inference allowed the jurists to avoid strict analogy in a case where no clear precedent could be found . In this case , public interest was distinguished as a basis for legislation . 
 Muslim scholars divided inference into three types . The first is the expression of the connection existing between one proposition and another without any specific effective cause . Next , inference could mean presumption that a state of things , which is not proved to have ceased , still continues . The final type of inference is the authority as to the revealed laws previous to Islam . 
 = = = Reason = = = 
 Shi 'ite jurists maintain that if a solution to a problem can not be found from the primary sources , then <unk> or reason should be given free rein to deduce a proper response from the primary sources . The process , whereby rational efforts are made by the jurist to arrive at an appropriate ruling , when applied is called ijtihad ( literally meaning " exerting oneself " ) . Shi 'ite jurists maintain that qiyas is a specific type of ijtihad . The Sunni Shafi ' school of thought , however , holds that both qiyas and ijtihad are the same . 
 Sunni jurists accepted ijtihad as a mechanism for deducing rulings . They , however , announced an end to its practice during the thirteenth century . The reason for this was that centers of Islamic learning ( such as Baghdad , Nishapur , and Bukhara ) had fallen into the hands of the Mongols . Thus , the " doors to ijtihad " , were closed . In Sunni Islam , thus , ijtihad was replaced by <unk> or the acceptance of doctrines developed previously . Later in Sunni history , however , there were notable instances of jurists using reason to re @-@ derive law from the first principles . One was Ibn <unk> ( d . 728 / 1328 ) , another was Ibn Rus ̲ h ̲ d ( Averroes d . 595 / 1198 ) . 
 There are many justifications , found in the Qur 'an and sunnah , for the use of ijtihad . For example , during a conversation with Mu <unk> ibn Jabal , Muhammad asked the former how he would give judgments . Mu <unk> replied that he would refer first to the Qur 'an , then to the Sunnah and finally commit to ijtihad to make his own judgment . Muhammad approved of this . 
 A lawyer who is qualified to use this source is called a mujtahid . The founders of the Sunni <unk> ( schools of law ) were considered such lawyers . All mujtahid exercise at the same time the powers of a mufti and can give fatwa . Some mujtahid have claimed to be <unk> ̲ <unk> , or " renewer of religion . " Such persons are thought to appear in every century . In Shi 'ite Islam they are regarded as the spokespersons of the hidden Imam . 
 = = = Local custom = = = 
 The term urf , meaning " to know " , refers to the customs and practices of a given society . Although this was not formally included in Islamic law , the sharia recognizes customs that prevailed at the time of Muhammad but were not abrogated by the Qur 'an or the tradition ( called " Divine silence " ) . Practices later innovated are also justified , since Islamic tradition says what the people , in general , consider good is also considered as such by God . According to some sources , urf holds as much authority as ijma ( consensus ) , and more than qiyas ( analogical deduction ) . <unk> is the Islamic equivalent of " common law " . 
 Local custom was first recognized by Abū Yūsuf ( d . 182 / 798 ) , an early leader of the <unk> school . However , it was considered part of the Sunnah , and not as formal source . Later , al @-@ <unk> ̲ h ̲ <unk> ( d . 483 / 1090 ) opposed it , holding that custom cannot prevail over a written text . 
 According to Sunni jurisprudence , in the application of local custom , custom that is accepted into law should be commonly prevalent in the region , not merely in an isolated locality . If it is in absolute opposition to Islamic texts , custom is disregarded . However , if it is in opposition to analogical reason , custom is given preference . Jurists also tend to , with caution , give precedence to custom over doctoral opinions of highly esteemed scholars . Shi 'ite scholars do not consider custom as a source of jurisprudence , nor do the <unk> or <unk> schools of Sunni jurisprudence .

 = SMS Baden ( 1880 ) = 
 SMS Baden was one of four Sachsen @-@ class armored frigates of the German Imperial Navy . Her sister ships were Sachsen , Bayern , and Württemberg . Baden was built in the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel from 1876 to 1883 . The ship was commissioned into the Imperial Navy in September 1883 . She was armed with a main battery of six 26 cm ( 10 in ) guns in two open barbettes . 
 After her commissioning , Baden served with the fleet on numerous training exercises and cruises in the 1880s and 1890s , during which she frequently simulated hostile naval forces . She participated in several cruises escorting Kaiser Wilhelm II on state visits to Great Britain and to various countries in the Baltic Sea in the late 1880s and early 1890s . During 1896 – 1897 , the ship was extensively rebuilt at the Germaniawerft dockyard in Kiel . She was removed from active duty in 1910 and thereafter served in a number of secondary roles , finally serving as a target hulk in the 1920s and 1930s . She was sold in April 1938 and broken up in 1939 – 1940 in Kiel . 
 = = Construction = = 
 Baden was ordered by the Imperial Navy under the contract name " C , " which denoted that the vessel was a new addition to the fleet . She was built at the Imperial Dockyard in Kiel ; her keel was laid in 1876 under construction number 4 . The ship was launched on 28 July 1880 and commissioned into the German fleet on 24 September 1883 . Along with her three sisters , Baden was the first large , armored warship built for the German navy that relied entirely on engines for propulsion . 
 The ship was 98 @.@ 20 meters ( 322 @.@ 2 ft ) long overall and had a beam of 18 @.@ 40 m ( 60 @.@ 4 ft ) and a draft of 6 @.@ 32 m ( 20 @.@ 7 ft ) forward . Baden was powered by two 3 @-@ cylinder triple expansion engines , which were supplied with steam by eight coal @-@ fired Dürr boilers . The ship 's top speed was 13 knots ( 24 km / h ; 15 mph ) , at 5 @,@ 600 indicated horsepower ( 4 @,@ 200 kW ) Her standard complement consisted of 32 officers and 285 enlisted men , though while serving as a squadron flagship this was augmented by another 7 officers and 34 men . 
 She was armed with six 26 cm ( 10 in ) guns , two of which were single @-@ mounted in an open barbette forward of the conning tower and the remaining four mounted amidships , also on single mounts in an open barbette . As built , the ship was also equipped with six 8 @.@ 7 cm ( 3 @.@ 4 in ) L / 24 guns and eight 3 @.@ 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) Hotchkiss revolver cannons . Baden 's armor was made of wrought iron , and was concentrated in an armored citadel amidships . The armor ranged from 203 to 254 mm ( 8 @.@ 0 to 10 @.@ 0 in ) on the armored citadel , and between 50 – 75 mm ( 2 @.@ 0 – 3 @.@ 0 in ) on the deck . The barbette armor was 254 mm of wrought iron backed by 250 mm of teak . 
 = = Service history = = 
 Commissioned in September 1883 , Baden joined the fleet too late to participate in the fleet maneuvers that year . Baden served as the flagship for Rear Admiral Alexander von Monts during the 1884 fleet maneuvers ; she was assigned to the I Division alongside her three sisters . The ship was placed in reserve in 1885 , but returned to active duty the following year for training exercises with the fleet . In June 1887 , Germany dedicated the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal ; Baden was among the ships present during the celebrations . 
 In 1888 , Baden returned to active duty to take part in a naval tour of the Baltic by the newly crowned Kaiser Wilhelm II . Rear Admiral Eduard Knorr , the commander of the fleet , raised his flag aboard Baden during the voyage . The fleet stopped in St. Petersburg , Stockholm , and Copenhagen on the seventeen @-@ day cruise . Baden ran aground in the harbors of both Stockholm and Copenhagen , but was not seriously damaged in either incident . Baden also participated in the visit to Great Britain in August 1889 , where Wilhelm II took part in the Cowes Regatta . Baden and the rest of the fleet joined the Royal Navy in a fleet review for Queen Victoria . 
 During the fleet maneuvers of 1890 , Baden and the rest of the capital ships of the I and II Divisions simulated a Russian attack on Kiel . The exercises were held in conjunction with IX Corps of the German Army , several divisions of which acted as a simulated amphibious invasion . Baden remained in the I Division in 1891 , when she was joined by the new coastal defense ship Siegfried . During the 1891 maneuvers , the I Division generally " fought " on the German side , against either Franco @-@ Russian or Danish @-@ Russian alliances . Baden was present for all of the fleet exercises in 1892 and 1893 . The maneuvers of the early 1890s were generally disappointments , as the " hostile " forces were judged to be the victors in the majority of the scenarios . 
 By the winter of 1894 – 1895 , the last of the four Brandenburg @-@ class battleships had been commissioned ; these ships were assigned to the I Division , which displaced Baden and her three sisters to the II Division . The eight ships conducted training cruises over the winter and spring before conducting the annual autumn fleet exercises . On 21 June 1895 , the Kaiser Wilhelm Canal was opened for traffic , eight years after work had begun . Baden and her three sisters , along with dozens of other warships , attended the ceremonies . The major naval powers sent fleets to join the fleet review . The Autumn 1895 maneuvers simulated a high @-@ seas battle between the I and II Divisions in the North Sea , followed by combined maneuvers with the rest of the fleet in the Baltic . 
 In 1896 , Baden went into drydock in the Germaniawerft dockyard in Kiel for an extensive modernization . The ship 's old wrought iron and teak armor was replaced with new Krupp nickel @-@ steel armor . The four funnels were trunked into a single large funnel and new engines were also installed , which increased the ship 's speed to 14 @.@ 9 kn ( 27 @.@ 6 km / h ; 17 @.@ 1 mph ) . The ship 's 8 @.@ 7 cm guns were replaced with quick @-@ firing 8 @.@ 8 cm ( 3 @.@ 5 in ) SK L / 30 guns and four 3 @.@ 7 cm ( 1 @.@ 5 in ) autocannons . Work was completed in 1897 . Baden remained with the fleet until 1910 , at which point she was removed from active duty . She then served as a blockade and defense hulk after 1912 . In 1920 , she was converted into a target hulk and stationed off <unk> . The ship was finally sold on 23 April 1938 and broken up for scrap in 1939 – 1940 in Kiel . 
 = Tomb of Safdarjung = 
 Safdarjung 's Tomb is a sandstone and marble mausoleum in New Delhi , India . It was built in 1754 in the late Mughal Empire style for the statesman Safdarjung . The monument has an ambiance of spaciousness and an imposing presence with its domed and arched red brown and white coloured structures . Safdarjung was made prime minister of the Mughal Empire ( Wazir ul @-@ <unk> @-@ i @-@ Hindustan ) when Ahmad Shah Bahadur ascended the throne in 1748 .

 The tomb is located near the Safdarjung Airport at the T junction of Lodhi Road and Aurobindo Marg ( road ) in New Delhi .

 The structure was constructed in 1754 in the late Mughal Empire style Safdarjung . 
 Mirza <unk> Abul Mansur Khan , who was popularly known as <unk> , who ruled over Avadh was an independent ruler of Avadh as viceroy of Muhammad <unk> was very rich and most powerful . With the death of Emperor Muhammad Shah of Mughal Empire , he moved to Delhi . When Mohammed Shah Ahmed Shah ascended the throne of the Mughal Empire in Delhi in 1748 , Safdarjung was made the Chief Minister ( Vizier ) of the empire with the title of Wazir ul @-@ <unk> @-@ i @-@ Hindustan and at that time the empire was on decline as their rule extended only to North India . 
 As Vizier he had taken all powers under his control as the king was only a puppet , a figurehead , who was into enjoying life with wine , opium and women . But he overestimated and over exercised his powers with the result that the Emperor ’ s family called their Hindu Maratha confederacy to help them get rid of their Vizier . A civil strife ensued and eventually in 1753 Safdarjung was driven out of Delhi . He died soon thereafter in 1754 . After his death his son Nawab <unk> Daula pleaded with the Mughal Emperor to permit him to erect a tomb for his father in Delhi . He then built the tomb , which was designed by an <unk> architect . 
 To the south of this tomb is the historic site of the battle that was fought in 1386 between Timur of <unk> and Mohammed Tughlaq when the latter was defeated . 
 = = Architecture = = 
 The Safdarjung tomb , the last monumental tomb garden of the Mughals , was planned and built like an enclosed garden tomb in line with the style of the Humayun tomb . It was completed in 1754 . The slabs from the tomb of Abdul Rahim <unk> were used in the construction of the tomb . 
 The tomb has four key features which are : The <unk> garden plan with the mausoleum at the center , a ninefold floor plan , a five @-@ part façade and a large podium with a hidden stairway . 
 The main entry gate to the tomb is two @-@ storied and its façade has very elaborate ornamentation over plastered surfaces and is in ornate purple colour . There is an inscription in Arabic on the surface and its translation reads “ When the hero of plain bravery departs from the transitory , may he become a resident of god ’ s paradise ” . The rear side of the façade , which is seen after entering through the gate , has many rooms and the library . To the right of the gate is the mosque which is a three @-@ domed structure marked with stripes . 
 Entering through the main gate gives a perfect view of the mausoleum . Its walls are built high and the central dome , which is the main mausoleum of Safdarjung , is built over a terrace . Red and buff stones are the materials used for building the main mausoleum which measures 28 metres ( 92 ft ) square . The central chamber , square in shape , has eight partitions with a cenotaph in the middle . Here there are partitions in rectangular shape and the corner partitions are in octagonal shape . The interior of the tomb is covered with rococo plaster with decorations . There are four towers around the main tomb at the corners which are polygonal in shape and are provided with kiosks . They have marble panels which are faded , and decorated arches . There is an underground chamber in the mausoleum which houses the graves of <unk> and his wife . The ceiling of the mosque has been plastered , painted and ornamented . 
 The façade , though built in the style of the Taj Mahal , lacks symmetry as the vertical axis has been given prominence which has resulted in an unbalanced appearance to the tomb . The dome is more elongated ; the central part has a taller pishtaq . The four minarets at the four corners are part of the main mausoleum which was totally a different concept in elevation compared to the Taj Mahal where the towers are detached and away from the facade of the tomb . 
 The architecture of the tomb is praised and also derided ; it is derided for the lack of proportioning of its various units and use of poor material for construction . Reginald Heber , who was Bishop of Calcutta between 1823 and 1826 , based on the light brown colour of the stone used , had observed that the tomb has the “ colour of potted meat ” . Even ASI has observed that the marble used for ornamentation in the towers though pleasing is “ rather florid ” . Another observation is that the tomb can not be compared to the Taj Mahal or the Humayun Tomb , as , at the time it was built , the Mughal Empire was on the decline and sandstone had to be used and lines were set improperly and the quality appeared “ thread bare ” . 
 = = Garden = = 
 The large square garden surrounding the tomb is surrounded by a wall that is approximately 280 metres ( 920 ft ) long on each side . The layout is in the form of four squares with wide foot paths and water tanks , which have been further subdivided into smaller squares . The garden is in the Mughal charbagh garden style , and is a smaller version of the garden of the Humayun Tomb which is also built in Delhi . One channel leads to the entrance gate and the other leads to the three pavilions . The main podium over which the mausoleum is built measures 50 metres ( 160 ft ) on each side . The high walls have been built in rubble stone masonry and have recessed arches in the interior . The towers or <unk> are octagonal in shape . Its overall layout consists of four pavilions which have multiple chambers and the entrance gateway to the east is impressive . On the eastern side adjoining the gate are many apartments and a mosque , and a courtyard . The pavilions are laid out in the western , northern and southern directions and are named <unk> Mahal ( palace in the forest ) , Moti Mahal ( pearl palace ) and Badshah <unk> ( King ’ s favorite ) respectively . Nawab ’ s family used to reside in these pavilions . Now the entire monument is under the control of Archaeological Survey of India ( ASI ) who have their offices in the pavilions and also a library over the main gate

 On 21 August 2012 , the then Health Minister of India , Ghulam Nabi Azad offered Eid prayers in a mosque in the complex . However under the law of Archaeological Survey of India ( ASI ) , " prayers at centrally protected monuments are not allowed unless the practice was prevalent at the time when it was notified as protected " and it is one of the 174 protected monument of ASI in Delhi . Earlier also , Indian vice president Hamid Ansari " planned to offer Eid prayers " at the tomb but was cancelled at the " eleventh hour " . 
 The tomb has four fountains on each of the four sides . In December 2013 , it was reported that a plan was going on for " activating the fountains " as officials believed that they " were in working condition " . But " in recent excavation " , ASI unearthed a drainage system adjacent to the fountain . The system would " help them restart these " . Though there are four fountains , but according to ASI , only one , which is opposite to the main entrance would be made " functional " . 
 In June 2014 , the ASI shifted their office from the tomb to General Pool Offices near the Indian National Army Colony . In November of the same year new visitor boards were installed in the tomb to " promote the lesser known but striking monuments in the city [ Delhi ] " . 
 The Hollywood film Jobs released in 2013 , was shot in the tomb . 
 = Petar Baćović = 
 Petar Baćović ( Serbian Cyrillic : <unk> <unk> ; 1898 – April 1945 ) was a Bosnian Serb reserve army officer , lawyer , and then a Chetnik commander ( vojvoda , вoјвода ) within occupied Yugoslavia during World War II . From the summer of 1941 until April 1942 , he headed the cabinet of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for Milan Nedić 's puppet Government of National Salvation in Belgrade . In July 1942 , Baćović was appointed by the Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović and his Supreme Command as the commander of the " Chetnik Operational Units in eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina " during which he collaborated with the Italians and Germans in actions against the Yugoslav Partisans . 
 Along with other Chetnik commanders , Baćović carried out numerous massacres of Bosnian Muslim and Catholic civilians and those sympathetic to the Partisan movement . In April 1945 , he was captured near Banja Luka by elements of the Armed Forces of the Independent State of Croatia ( HOS ) along with Chetnik leaders Pavle Đurišić and Zaharije Ostojić , and Chetnik ideologue Dragiša Vasić in what was apparently a trap . According to some sources , Baćović and the others were taken to the area of the Jasenovac concentration camp , where they were killed . 
 = = Early life = = 
 Petar Baćović was born in 1898 in Kalinovik , a village within the Bosnia Vilayet , a province of the Ottoman Empire that was occupied by Austria @-@ Hungary in 1878 . His father Maksim was a Chetnik commander ( Serbo @-@ Croatian : vojvoda , вoјвода ) . Prior to World War II , Baćović was a major in the Royal Yugoslav Army reserve . He also studied law , did with legal work , and was a governor 's notary immediately prior to the outbreak of war .

 From the summer of 1941 , Baćović headed the cabinet of the Ministry of Internal Affairs for Milan Nedić 's German @-@ installed puppet Government of National Salvation in the German @-@ occupied Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia . Chetnik leader Draža Mihailović , with no direct control over the many independent Chetnik bands throughout partitioned and occupied Yugoslavia , had been corresponding with some of their leaders via letter and courier . Following an agreement between Nedić and Mihailović , in April 1942 Baćović left Belgrade and went to join the Chetniks operating in eastern Bosnia , then part of the Axis puppet state , the Independent State of Croatia ( Croatian : Nezavisna Država Hrvatska , NDH ) . He was sent as Mihailović 's permanent representative to Dobroslav Jevđević and Ilija Trifunović @-@ Birčanin , the main spokesmen for the Chetnik bands in Herzegovina .

 From mid @-@ May to early June 1942 , Baćović took part in the joint Italian @-@ Chetnik 1942 Montenegro offensive against the Partisans , which also included operations in eastern Herzegovina . Baćović led Chetnik forces fighting against the Partisans in the Sandžak region that straddled the border between Italian @-@ occupied Montenegro and German @-@ occupied Serbia . His troops fought alongside Sandžak Chetniks led by Zdravko <unk> and Vojislav Lukačević , and the Požega Chetnik detachment led by <unk> <unk> and Miloš Glišić . The Požega Chetniks had been " legalised " as auxiliaries by the Nedić puppet government with the approval of the Germans . These forces also fought alongside the Italian 19th Infantry Division Venezia and 5th Alpine Division <unk> , and were one of three main Chetnik formations involved in the joint offensive , the others being led by the Montenegrin Serbs Pavle Đurišić and Bajo Stanišić . In the face of the three @-@ pronged assault , the outnumbered Partisan forces withdrew from Montenegro and eastern Herzegovina into southeastern Bosnia , and then undertook the Partisan Long March to western Bosnia . At the end of May , Baćović submitted a report to Mihailović on Đurišić 's troops and the significant amounts of weapons and equipment he had received from the Italians . 
 = = = Legalization by the Italians = = = 
 In the summer of 1942 , after order had been established in significant parts of the Italian occupation zone of the NDH , Chetnik detachment leaders including Petar <unk> , Momčilo Đujić , Uroš Drenović , Jevđević , Trifunović @-@ Birčanin , and their principal political spokesmen with Italian Second Army headquarters were recognized as auxiliaries by the Italians . Early in that summer , the commander of the Italian Second Army , Generale Mario Roatta agreed to the delivery of arms , munitions , and supplies to the Chetniks . On 16 July 1942 , Baćović , acting as one of Jevđević 's military organizers , informed Mihailović that the vast majority of the 7 @,@ 000 Chetniks in Herzegovina were well equipped with small arms and had been " legalized " by the Italians . Combined with Đujić 's group , the number of " legalized " Chetniks in the Italian zone of the NDH stood at 10 @,@ 000 or more . 
 From March 1942 on , Mihailović had been looking for opportunities to create a " national corridor " connecting all the Chetnik groups operating in the Italian @-@ occupied areas of the NDH , from Montenegro , Herzegovina , Dalmatia , to Lika and western Bosnia . In June , to advance Mihailović 's aim of creating a " national corridor " , Jevđević offered to send 2 @,@ 000 Herzegovinian Chetniks to Dalmatia , where they would be placed under the control of Trifunović @-@ Birčanin . Transfer of Chetnik forces to Dalmatia also created an opportunity to strike at the major concentration of Partisan strength at that time , in western Bosnia . 
 = = = Zimonjić Kula conference = = = 
 On 22 and 23 July 1942 , Mihailović held a conference at Zimonjić Kula , near Avtovac in eastern Herzegovina , which was attended by Trifunović @-@ Birčanin , Đurišić , Jevđević , Zaharije Ostojić , Radovan Ivanišević , Milan <unk> and a group of Chetnik commanders from Herzegovina . The purpose of the meeting was to establish co @-@ operation between the Herzegovinian and Montenegrin Chetnik leaders . Baćović was appointed as the Chetnik commander for eastern Bosnia and Herzegovina , replacing Boško Todorović , who had been captured and executed by the Partisans in late February 1942 . Trifunović @-@ Birčanin was appointed the Chetnik commander for Dalmatia , Lika and western Bosnia . 
 The historian <unk> Jelić @-@ <unk> believes that the idea of an anti @-@ Partisan offensive was also discussed at the conference as a potential response to the Zagreb agreement concluded between Italy and the NDH in June . The Zagreb agreement heralded a major drawdown of Italian occupation forces from large areas of the NDH , including areas of Bosnia south of the Italian @-@ German demarcation line , as well as Kordun , Lika and Dalmatia , and the Chetnik leaders believed that this would reduce the area in which they could operate with Italian consent . On the second day of the conference , Jevđević and Trifunović @-@ Birčanin travelled to nearby Trebinje and conferred with two other Chetnik commanders , Radmilo <unk> and Milan Šantić , who agreed on a set of goals and a strategy to achieve them : 
 the creation of Greater Serbia ; 
 the destruction of the Partisans ; 
 the removal of the Catholics and Muslims ; 
 non @-@ recognition of the NDH ; 
 no collaboration with the Germans ; and 
 temporary collaboration with the Italians for weapons , munitions and food . 
 The Chetniks addressed a crowd in Trebinje , announcing that they had cells in every village in eastern Herzegovina , and were establishing a Greater Serbia . Only five days after Baćović 's appointment , the commander of the Mountain Staff of the Bosnian Chetnik Detachments , Stevan Botić , demanded Baćović be replaced . Botić had appointed himself as commander of the Mountain Staff after the previous commander , Jezdimir Dangić had been arrested in Belgrade in April 1942 . Botić and his allies opposed Mihailović 's control because they favoured a political rather than strictly military organisation , wanted to continue the alliance with the Nedić regime that Dangić had forged , and opposed the control of Bosnian Chetniks by non @-@ Bosnians . Botić also wanted to remain independent of Mihailović so that he could freely kill Muslims and Bosnian Croats without damaging Mihailović 's standing with the Serb people through close association with Botić 's activities . Soon after the conference , both Baćović and Trifunović @-@ Birčanin were negotiating with Italian VI Corps and XVIII Corps headquarters staff regarding the proposed offensive against the Partisans in western Bosnia . 
 By August , Baćović was advocating the " liquidation " of Botić 's Mountain Staff because they were creating disunity , and trying to politicise the Chetnik movement in Bosnia and Herzegovina on the model of the League of Farmers , which had defended the interests of Bosnian Serb peasants against Muslim landowners during the interwar period . On 6 August 1942 , in a continued Chetnik effort to eliminate external enemies and purge their own ranks , Baćović ordered the subordinate commanders of all corps and brigades to submit lists of such individuals with suggestions on how to deal with them . Brigade commanders were required to send three assassins to kill any person whom they labelled with the letter " Z " ( from the Serbo @-@ Croatian : <unk> , meaning " murder " ) within 24 hours of receiving the name . Baćović demanded that " the killing has to be done exclusively through the use of slaughtering knife " . 
 = = = Capture of Foča and massacres of Muslims and Croats = = = 
 On 19 August , Chetniks commanded by Ostojić , but drawn mainly from Đurišić 's Lim @-@ Sandžak Chetnik Detachment and acting on the orders of Mihailović , attacked and captured the eastern Bosnian town of Foča , which had been abandoned by the Partisans in June and had then been occupied by NDH forces . After a two @-@ hour battle , Chetnik units entered Foča and began massacring the Muslim population of the town , regardless of gender and age . According to the initial Chetnik reports , a total of 1 @,@ 000 people were killed , including about 450 members of the Croatian Home Guard and Ustaše Militia , as well as around 300 women and children . Later Chetnik reports stated that between 2 @,@ 000 and 3 @,@ 000 were killed in Foča after its capture . A few days after they seized Foča , Baćović and Jevđević reported to Mihailović that all traces of the massacre had been removed and they had formally announced that those responsible for looting and killing had been shot . Eight days after the capture of Foča , Baćović wrote , " on that occasion 1 @,@ 200 Ustaše in uniform and about 1 @,@ 000 compromised Muslims perished , while we suffered only four dead and five wounded " . 
 On a field near <unk> and <unk> in eastern Bosnia , the Chetniks of Baćović and Ostojić massacred about 2 @,@ 500 Muslims and burned a number of villages . Baćović also killed a number of Partisan sympathizers elsewhere . In September 1942 , Baćović completed a tour of Chetnik units in Herzegovina , and reported that the morale of the population was excellent and that the actions of the Ustaše and Partisans were drawing the populace to the Chetniks . That same month , his Chetniks killed 900 Croats in the coastal town of Makarska . Baćović 's reports made it plain that his forces were conducting planned operations to kill or drive out the Muslim and Catholic population of Herzegovina . One of these reports stated that during reprisal attacks against the towns of <unk> in western Herzegovina and <unk> in the Dalmatian hinterland , his Chetniks had skinned alive three Catholic priests , killed all men over fifteen , and razed 17 villages . 
 = = = Operation Alfa and subsequent massacres = = = 
 Towards the end of August 1942 , Mihailović issued directives to Chetnik units ordering them to prepare for a large scale anti @-@ Partisan operation alongside Italian and NDH troops . In September 1942 , aware that they were unable to defeat the Partisans alone , the Chetniks tried to persuade the Italians to undertake a large operation against the Partisans in western Bosnia . Trifunović @-@ Birčanin met with Roatta on 10 and 21 September and urged him to undertake this operation as soon as possible to clear the Partisans from the Prozor – Livno area and offered 7 @,@ 500 Chetniks as aid on the condition that they be provided with the necessary arms and supplies . He was successful in obtaining some arms and promises of action . The proposed operation , faced with opposition from Ustaše leader Ante Pavelić and a cautious Italian high command , was nearly cancelled , but after Jevđević and Trifunović @-@ Birčanin promised to cooperate with Croat and Muslim anti @-@ Partisan units , it went ahead , with less Chetnik involvement . 
 Baćović and Jevđević , with 3 @,@ 000 Herzegovinian Chetniks , participated in the Italian @-@ led Operation Alfa , which involved a two @-@ pronged thrust towards Prozor . The Chetniks fought alongside the Italian 18th Infantry Division Messina as they advanced from the line of the Neretva River , while the German 714th and 718th Infantry Divisions , and NDH forces drove from the north . Before the offensive Baćović had openly announced his plans to destroy entire Muslim villages . Prozor and some smaller towns were captured by the combined Italian – Chetnik force . Chetniks under Baćović and Jevđević 's command participated enthusiastically in the operation , burning Croat and Muslim villages and killing civilians . Between 14 and 15 October , the Herzegovinian Chetniks massacred over 500 Muslims and Croats and razed several villages , alleging that they had " harbored and aided the Partisans " . On 23 October , Baćović reported to Mihailović that " in the operation in Prozor we slaughtered more than 2 @,@ 000 Croats and Muslims . Our soldiers returned enthusiastic " . According to the historian Jozo Tomasevich , incomplete data shows that 543 civilians were massacred . At least 656 victims have been listed by name , while another source states that about 848 people were killed , mainly " children , women , and the elderly " . Historian Ivo Goldstein also mentions an estimate of 1 @,@ 500 victims , and attributes the discrepancy " to the fact that the estimates refer to different territories " . 
 Roatta objected to these " massive slaughters " of noncombatant civilians and threatened to halt Italian aid to the Chetniks if they did not end . He requested that " Trifunović be apprised that if the Chetnik violence against the Croatian and Muslim population is not immediately stopped , we will stop supplying food and daily wages to those formations whose members are perpetrators of the violence . If this criminal situation continues , more severe measures will be undertaken " . The massacre angered the NDH government and the Italians had to order the Chetniks to withdraw from Prozor . Some were discharged altogether while others were later sent to northern Dalmatia to aid Đujić 's forces . Operation Beta later followed in the same month in which the Italians and NDH forces captured Livno and surrounding localities . A month after the massacre , Jevđević and Baćović wrote a self @-@ critical report on Prozor to Mihailović , hoping to distance themselves from the actions of their troops . 
 In October 1942 , Baćović issued an appeal to Serb Partisans which blamed the establishment of the Partisan movement on Jews and " the scum of the earth " . He blamed the Partisans for the destruction of traditional Serb society , religion and morals , claiming that they were corrupting women and the young , and promoting incest and immorality . He further deplored to Serb Partisans that they were being led by " Jews , Muslims , Croats , Magyars , Bulgarians " . In the same month , his staff issued a further appeal , claiming that the Serb Chetniks controlled all of Serbia , Montenegro , Sandžak , Herzegovina and most of Bosnia , and that Serb Partisans were to be found only in a few places in Bosnia . He urged them to defect to the Chetniks so that they could return to being " good Serbs " and contribute to the creation of a " free and Great Serb state " . Baćović 's bands committed further atrocities against Croats and Muslims in Mostar and Konjic in November . 
 = = = Operations in northern Dalmatia and Lika = = = 
 In late September or early October 1942 , Baćović and Jevđević held talks with Muslim leader Ismet Popovac and agreed to recruit Muslims into the Chetnik ranks . Popovac 's Muslim Chetnik militia later fought the Partisans during the Axis @-@ led Case White offensive in early 1943 , but did not distinguish itself . By December 1943 , an estimated 4 @,@ 000 ( or eight percent ) of Mihailović 's Chetniks were Muslim . In November and December 1942 , the Italians helped about 4 @,@ 000 of Baćović 's Chetniks in Herzegovina relocate to northern Dalmatia and Lika with another 4 @,@ 000 to be relocated later . On 8 January , Baćović was conferred the title of vojvoda by the ailing Trifunović @-@ Birčanin . 
 In late January 1943 , Baćović 's forces in northern Dalmatia committed a massacre of Croat civilians in the town of Vrlika , near Split . Following Trifunović @-@ Birčanin 's death in February 1943 , Baćović , Jevđević , Đujić and Baćović 's chief of staff Radovan Ivanišević vowed to continue his policy of closely collaborating with the Italians against the Partisans . On 10 February 1943 , a proclamation signed by Baćović , Đujić , Ivanišević and Ilija <unk> was issued . It declared to the people of Bosnia , Lika and Dalmatia that the Chetniks had cleansed Serbia , Montenegro , and Herzegovina of the Partisans , and were about to do the same in their areas . The declaration denounced the Partisans as the " criminal band of Tito , <unk> Pijade , Levi Vajnert , and other paid Jews " . The declaration also called upon the Partisan rank and file to kill their political commissars and join the Chetniks , and claimed that hundreds of their comrades were surrendering to the Chetniks every day because they realised that they had been " betrayed and swindled by the Communist Jews " . 
 By 28 February 1943 , 2 @,@ 807 of the 8 @,@ 137 Chetniks operating in northern Dalmatia as part of the Italian Anti @-@ Communist Volunteer Militia ( <unk> ) <unk> Corps were under Baćović 's command . In July 1943 , Montenegrin Partisan leader Milovan Đilas contacted both Baćović and Ostojić to establish their willingness to work jointly against the Germans and Italians , given that a new Yugoslav government @-@ in @-@ exile was about to be established in London without Mihailović . Baćović and Ostojić reported this contact to Mihailović who threatened to exclude them from his Chetnik organization if they maintained contact with the Partisans . 
 = = = Cairo , London and return to Yugoslavia = = = 
 In mid @-@ February 1944 , Baćović and Lukačević accompanied Special Operations Executive ( SOE ) Colonel Bill Bailey to the coast south of Dubrovnik and were evacuated from Cavtat by a Royal Navy gunboat . They then travelled via Cairo to London , where Lukačević represented Mihailović at King Peter 's wedding on 20 March 1944 . After the British government decided to withdraw support from Mihailović , Baćović and Lukačević were not allowed to return to Yugoslavia until the British mission to Mihailović headed by Brigadier Charles Armstrong had been safely evacuated from occupied territory . The two were detained by the British in Bari and thoroughly searched by local authorities , who suspected them of a robbery that had occurred in the Yugoslav consulate in Cairo . Most of the money , jewelry and uncensored letters that they were carrying were impounded . The two were flown out of Bari on 30 May , and landed on an airfield at Pranjani northwest of Čačak shortly after . Because their landing at Pranjani coincided with Armstrong 's departure , Baćović and Lukačević demanded that Armstrong be held as a hostage until their impounded belongings could be returned from Bari . The Chetnik personnel at the airfield refused to keep Armstrong any further , and he was allowed to depart without incident . 
 Later that month , Baćović helped organize a Chetnik " Independent Group of National Resistance " and wanted to contact British forces who they expected to land in the southern Adriatic coast . On 11 September 1944 , Baćović and Ostojić warned Chetnik headquarters that Muslims and Croats were joining the Partisans in large numbers and that Chetniks in Bosnia and Herzegovina lacked food and ammunition . They suggested that Mihailović request an Allied occupation of Yugoslavia or risk losing the war both politically and militarily . They assessed that the population had sensed that the Partisans were now supported by the three major Allied Powers , but that the Chetniks had now been abandoned by them . Baćović had always urged Mihailović to show restraint in his dealings with the Germans and Italians , and often warned Mihailović that he must never be seen openly cooperating with the occupiers . On 20 October 1944 , Partisan and Soviet Red Army troops took Belgrade from the Germans . Soon after the Chetniks lost Serbia , the center of their movement . After the breakdown of the Chetnik movement in early 1945 , Baćović was no longer loyal to Mihailović . 
 = = = Withdrawal and death = = = 
 Baćović joined Đurišić 's forces in their trek towards Slovenia , alongside Chetnik ideologue Dragiša Vasić , detachments commanded by Ostojić , and a large number of refugees , totaling around 10 @,@ 000 . This force was formed into the Chetnik 8th Montenegrin Army , consisting of the 1st , 5th , 8th and 9th ( Herzegovina ) divisions . Earlier , Đurišić and Mihailović had argued over the best course of action . Đurišić had wanted to withdraw through Albania to Greece , but Mihailović had told him to prepare for an Allied landing , the return of the king and the establishment of a national government . From the time Đurišić joined Mihailović in northeastern Bosnia , he was very critical of Mihailović 's leadership and argued strongly for all remaining Chetnik troops to move to Slovenia . When Mihailović remained unconvinced , Đurišić decided to move to Slovenia independently of him , and arranged for Dimitrije Ljotić 's Serbian Volunteer Corps already in Slovenia to meet him near Bihać in western Bosnia to assist his movement . 
 In order to get to Bihać , Đurišić made a safe @-@ conduct agreement with elements of the Armed Forces of the NDH and with the Montenegrin separatist Sekula Drljević . The details of the agreement are not known , but it appears that he and his troops were meant to cross the Sava River into Slavonia where they would be aligned with Drljević as the " Montenegrin National Army " with Đurišić retaining operational command . Đurišić apparently tried to outsmart them and sent only his sick and wounded across the river , keeping his fit troops south of the river . He began moving his command westwards and , harassed by both the NDH troops and Partisans , reached the Vrbas River . In the Battle of Lijevče Field , north of Banja Luka , the combined Chetnik force was defeated by a strong NDH force which was armed with German @-@ supplied tanks . 
 Following this defeat and the defection of one of his sub @-@ units to Drljević , Đurišić was induced to negotiate directly with the leaders of the NDH forces about the further movement of his Chetniks towards Slovenia . However , this appears to have been a trap , as he was attacked and captured by them on his way to the meeting . According to Tomasevich , exactly what occurred after his capture is not clear , but Baćović , Đurišić , Vasić and Ostojić were subsequently killed , along with some Serbian Orthodox priests and others . According to some sources , on 20 April , Đurišić , Baćović , Vasić and Ostojić were taken to the Stara Gradiška prison , near Jasenovac . The Ustaše gathered them in a field alongside 5 @,@ 000 other Chetnik prisoners and arranged for Drljević and his followers to select 150 Chetnik officers and non @-@ combatant intellectuals for execution . Đurišić , Baćović , Vasić and Ostojić were amongst those selected . They and the others were loaded onto boats by the Ustaše and taken across the Sava River , never to be seen again . It is reported that they were killed either in the Jasenovac concentration camp itself , or in a marsh in its vicinity . The website of the Jasenovac Memorial Site lists Baćović as having been killed at the camp by the Ustaše in 1945 . Both the NDH forces and Drljević had reasons for ensnaring Đurišić . The NDH forces were motivated by the mass terror committed by Đurišić on the Muslim population in Sandžak and southeastern Bosnia while Drljević was opposed to Đurišić 's support of a union of Serbia and Montenegro which ran counter to Drljević 's separatism .

 Maryland Route 300 ( MD 300 ) is a state highway in the U.S. state of Maryland . Known for most of its length as Sudlersville Road , the highway runs 13 @.@ 55 miles ( 21 @.@ 81 km ) from MD 213 in Church Hill east through Sudlersville to the Delaware state line , where the highway continues as Delaware Route 300 ( DE 300 ) . Together with DE 300 , DE 44 , and DE 8 , MD 300 forms the primary east – west connection between U.S. Route 301 ( US 301 ) in northern Queen Anne 's County and Dover , Delaware . MD 300 between Church Hill and Dudley Corners was one of the original state roads marked for improvement in 1909 . The highway was completed between Church Hill and Sudlersville around 1920 . MD 300 between Sudlersville and the Delaware state line was constructed in the late 1920s and early 1930s .

The state highway intersects US 301 ( Blue Star Memorial Highway ) at a superstreet intersection . Traffic on MD 300 is required to turn right onto US 301 , perform a U @-@ turn , then turn right again to continue on MD 300 . The highway continues northeast before curving east at the crossing of Red Lion Branch and intersecting MD 290 ( Crumpton Road ) and Benton Corners Road at Dudley Corners , which is the site of historic Dudley 's Chapel . 
 MD 300 heads east to the town of Sudlersville , where the highway 's name changes to Main Street . The highway intersects MD 837 ( Church Circle ) and MD 313 ( Church Street ) before crossing the Centreville Branch of the Northern Line of the Maryland and Delaware Railroad . MD 300 becomes Sudlersville Road again upon leaving the town . The highway crosses Unicorn Branch , intersects Duhamel Corner Road and Peters Corner Road , and crosses Andover Branch . MD 300 curves to the northeast at <unk> Church Road to its eastern terminus at the Delaware state line , where Sudlersville Road continues east as DE 300 . A short distance east of the state line at Everetts Corner , the highway intersects DE 44 , which leads to DE 8 and Dover . DE 300 heads east from there toward Kenton and Smyrna . 
 MD 300 is officially separated into two sections by the US 301 superstreet intersection ; MD 300 runs east of US 301 and MD <unk> is the portion west of the U.S. Highway . The portion of the highway from US 301 to the Delaware state line is a part of the National Highway System . 
 = = History = = 
 The portion of MD 300 between Church Hill and Dudley Corners was designated one of the original state roads , as part of a connection to Crumpton , by the Maryland State Roads Commission in 1909 . In 1915 , no work on this segment had begun , but by then it was no longer considered a necessary part of the statewide road system . The first segment of MD 300 was a 9 @-@ foot @-@ wide ( 2 @.@ 7 m ) macadam state @-@ aid road built between Dudley Corners and Sudlersville by 1910 . The link between Church Hill and Dudley Corners was completed as a 15 @-@ foot @-@ wide ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) concrete state @-@ aid road between 1919 and 1921 . The portions of the Church Hill – Sudlersville road narrower than 15 feet ( 4 @.@ 6 m ) were widened to this width with macadam shoulders by 1926 . 
 The portion of MD 300 between Sudlersville and the Delaware state line was started in 1926 ; the paving of Main Street in concrete from MD 313 to the railroad crossing within Sudlersville was completed in 1927 . The concrete highway was extended to Duhamel Corner Road in 1928 and to Peters Corner Road in 1930 . MD 300 was marked along the length of Sudlersville Road when it was completed to the state line between 1930 and 1933 . When MD 213 's bypass of Church Hill was completed in 1971 , MD 300 was extended west to its present terminus . MD <unk> was designated along the portion of MD 300 west of US 301 when the superstreet intersection between the two highways was installed in 2005 .

The first system , Hurricane One , was initially observed on June 25 . The final storm , Hurricane Five , was last observed on October 22 . These dates fall within the period with the most tropical cyclone activity in the Atlantic . No tropical cyclones during this season existed simultaneously . One tropical cyclone has a single known point in its track due to a sparsity of data . 
 Of the season 's five tropical cyclones , three reached hurricane status . Furthermore , one of those strengthened into a major hurricane , which is Category 3 or higher on the modern @-@ day Saffir – Simpson hurricane wind scale . The strongest cyclone of the season , the third hurricane , peaked at Category 3 strength with 125 mph ( 205 km / h ) winds . After making landfall near the Georgia @-@ South Carolina border , the storm caused 26 fatalities and extensive damage in the area . Hurricane Four caused four deaths and approximately $ 20 @,@ 000 ( 1854 USD ) in damage after striking the coast of Texas . Hurricane One also caused moderate damage in Texas . 
 The season 's activity was reflected with a low accumulated cyclone energy ( ACE ) rating of 31 . ACE is , broadly speaking , a measure of the power of the hurricane multiplied by the length of time it existed , so storms that last a long time , as well as particularly strong hurricanes , have high ACEs . ACE is only calculated for full advisories on tropical systems at or exceeding 34 knots ( 39 mph , 63 km / h ) or tropical storm strength .

 = Senate House ( University of London ) = 
 Senate House is the administrative centre of the University of London , situated in the heart of Bloomsbury , London between the School of Oriental and African Studies to the east , and the British Museum to the south . The Art Deco building was constructed between 1932 and 1937 as the first phase of a large uncompleted scheme designed for the University by Charles Holden . It consists of 19 floors and is 210 feet ( 64 m ) high . 
 Today the main building contains the University of London 's Central Academic Bodies and activities , including the offices of the Vice @-@ Chancellor of the University , the entire collection of the Senate House Library , and eight of the ten research institutes of the School of Advanced Study . During the Second World War , the building 's use by the Ministry of Information inspired two noted English writers . Graham Greene 's novel The Ministry of Fear ( 1943 ) and its film adaptation Ministry of Fear by Fritz Lang ( 1944 ) set in Bloomsbury . George Orwell 's wife Eileen worked in Senate House for the Censorship Department of the Ministry of Information , and her experiences acted as the description of the Ministry of Truth in Orwell 's 1949 novel Nineteen Eighty @-@ Four . 
 = = History = = 
 After the First World War the University of London , then based at the Imperial Institute in Kensington was in urgent need of new office and teaching space to allow for its growth and expansion . In 1921 , the government bought 11 acres ( 4 @.@ 5 ha ) of land in Bloomsbury from the Duke of Bedford to provide a new site for the University . However , many within the university were opposed to a move , and , in 1926 , the Duke bought back the land . The election of William Beveridge however to the post of Vice @-@ Chancellor of the University in June 1926 was highly significant as Beveridge supported a move to Bloomsbury . Beveridge persuaded the Rockefeller Foundation to donate £ 400 @,@ 000 to the University and the original site was reacquired in 1927 . 
 Beveridge saw the university as one " for the nation and the world , drawing from overseas as many students as Oxford and Cambridge and all the other English universities together . " and specified that " the central symbol of the University on the Bloomsbury site can not fittingly look like an imitation of any other University , it must not be a replica from the Middle Ages . It should be something that could not have been built by any earlier generation than this , and can only be at home in London ... ( the building ) means a chance to enrich London – to give London at its heart not just more streets and shops ... but a great architectural feature ... an academic island in swirling tides of traffic , a world of learning in a world of affairs . " 
 The grand art deco design was the work of Charles Holden , who was appointed as architect in March 1931 from a short list which also included Giles Gilbert Scott , Percy Scott Worthington and Arnold Dunbar Smith . In making their choice , Beveridge and the Principal , Edwin Deller , were influenced by the success of Holden 's recently completed 55 Broadway , designed as the headquarters for the London Electric Railway and then the tallest office building in London . 
 Holden 's original plan for the university building was for a single structure covering the whole site , stretching almost 1 @,@ 200 feet ( 370 m ) from Montague Place to Torrington Street . It comprised a central spine linked by a series of wings to the perimeter façade and enclosing a series of courtyards . The scheme was to be topped by two towers ; the taller Senate House and a smaller one to the north . The design featured elevations of load @-@ bearing brick work faced with Portland stone . Construction began in 1932 and was undertaken by Holland , Hannen & Cubitts . King George V laid the ceremonial foundation stone on 26 June 1933 and the first staff moved in during 1936 , the University 's centenary year . On 28 November 1936 , a group of University officials , led by the Principal , Sir Edwin Deller , went out to inspect the work in progress . Suddenly , without warning , a skip being pushed by a workman overhead accidentally fell down and hit them . All were rushed to University College Hospital , where two days later , Deller died of his injuries . Due to a lack of funds , the full design was gradually cut back , and only the Senate House and Library were completed in 1937 , although the external flanking wings of the north @-@ eastern courtyard were not constructed . As he had with his earlier buildings , Holden also prepared the designs for the individual elements of the interior design . The completion of the buildings for the Institute of Education and the School of Oriental Studies followed , but the onset of the Second World War prevented any further progress on the full scheme . 
 = = = Critical opinion = = = 
 The architectural character and scale of the building has received both positive and negative criticism since its construction . Steen Eiler Rasmussen , a friend of Holden , commented that , with the expansive design , " the London University is swallowing more and more of the old houses , and this quarter – which the Duke of Bedford laid out for good domestic houses – has taken on quite a different character . " Evelyn Waugh , in Put Out More Flags , describes it as " the vast bulk of London University insulting the autumnal sky . " 
 Positive comments came from functionalist architect Erich Mendelsohn in 1938 , who wrote to Holden that he was " very much taken and am convinced that there is no finer building in London . " Architectural historian Arnold <unk> described the building as a " static massive pyramid ... obviously designed to last for a thousand years " , but thought " the interior is more pleasing than the exterior . There is essentially the atmosphere of dignity , serenity and repose that one associates with the architecture of ancient Greece . " Nikolaus Pevsner was less enthusiastic . He described its style as " strangely semi @-@ traditional , undecided modernism " and summarised the result : " The design certainly does not possess the vigour and directness of Charles Holden 's smaller Underground stations . " Others have described it as Stalinist , or as totalitarian due to its great scale . 
 Holden recognised that his architectural style placed him in " rather a curious position , not quite in the fashion and not quite out of it ; not enough of a traditionalist to please the traditionalists and not enough of a modernist to please the modernists . "

 Senate House remains a prominent landmark throughout Bloomsbury and is visible from some distance away . The building was listed as Grade II * in 1969 Following a multimillion @-@ pound refurbishment in 2006 , Senate House has also become a popular conference and event venue playing host to some of the city 's most prestigious events including London Fashion Week . 
 Following the relaxation of the rules in the UK on university status under the Major government and consequential stirrings towards full independence of the larger London University colleges , the future of the Senate House library has from time to time been called into question . However , Senate House remains , and continues to be home both to the Vice @-@ Chancellor of the University of London and to the deep resources of the University library ; indeed , it has recently undergone a refurbishment to bring it up to modern standards and to reinstate some of Holden 's original interiors . 
 Some schools in constituent colleges , such as the Birkbeck School of Computer Science and Information Systems ( until 2010 ) , and the School of Advanced Study ( the UK 's national centre for the facilitation and promotion of research in the humanities and social sciences ) are or were based in Senate House . SOAS is moving into the north block of Senate House from 2016 . 
 The main entrance is from Malet Street to the west and the rear entrance from Russell Square to the east .

 Senate House Library ( formerly known as the University of London Library ) occupies the fourth to the eighteenth floors of the building with the public areas of the library on the fourth to seventh floors , which is open to staff and students of all colleges within the university ( although levels of access differ between institutions ) and contains material relevant chiefly to arts , humanities , and social science subjects . 
 The library is administered by the central university as part the Senate House Libraries and in 2005 had over 32 @,@ 000 registered users . The library holds around three million volumes , including 120 @,@ 000 volumes printed before 1851 . The Library started with the foundation of the University of London in 1836 , but began to develop from 1871 when a book fund was started . 
 Along with a subscription to over 5 @,@ 200 Journals , other resources include the Goldsmiths ' Library of Economic Literature , and the Palaeography room 's collection of western European manuscripts . The library also holds over 170 @,@ 000 theses by graduate students . From 2006 onwards , the library has been undergoing a comprehensive refurbishment process . 
 The Library is also home to the University of London archives , which include the central archive of the University itself and many other collections , including the papers of philanthropist Charles Booth , philosopher Herbert Spencer , actress and mystic Florence Farr , author and artist Thomas Sturge Moore , writer Opal Whiteley , and publishing company Gerald Duckworth and Company Ltd .

 " The Edge of Glory " is a song by American singer Lady Gaga from her second studio album , Born This Way ( 2011 ) . The song was released on May 9 , 2011 as the album 's third single . Initially released as one of two promotional singles for Born This Way , it shortly became a single following its success in digital outlets worldwide . The song was written and produced by Gaga and Fernando Garibay , and is a pop and disco song that speaks of the very last moments of life . According to Gaga , lyrical inspiration came from the death of her grandfather , who died in September 2010 . Alongside a saxophone solo played by the late Clarence Clemons , the melody of the song resembles much of the musical works of Bruce Springsteen , and contains several qualities similar to that of 1980s adult contemporary musical works . 
 " The Edge of Glory " received critical acclaim , with many reviewers deeming it as an album highlight . Much of the praise went to the song 's chorus and the musical production . Reviewers also complimented Gaga 's vocals , describing it as " soulful " . The song was a commercial success worldwide , charting in the top ten in several major music markets , including Australia , Belgium , Canada , New Zealand , Norway , Spain and the United Kingdom . In the United States , it peaked at number three on the Billboard Hot 100 , becoming Gaga 's tenth consecutive top @-@ ten single in the United States . 
 A music video for the song was filmed in late May , co @-@ directed by the singer and her production team , Haus of Gaga . The video is simple in contrast to much of Gaga 's previous work , and portrays her dancing on a fire @-@ escape and walking on a lonely street . Differences include the lack of intricate choreography and back @-@ up dancers , as well as using only one outfit designed by Versace . Critics lauded the simplicity of the video , while comparing it to the works of Michael Jackson , Janet Jackson and Madonna . Gaga has performed the song in award shows , music festivals and her concert tours .

 " The Edge of Glory " was written by Lady Gaga , Fernando Garibay and DJ White Shadow , and was produced by Gaga and Garibay . The origins of the song first came about in January 2011 , when Gaga released part of the lyrics on her Twitter account . White Shadow revealed that before they returned to Europe for the 2010 dates of The Monster Ball Tour , Gaga had taken leave for few days to be with her ailing grandfather . After he died , Gaga told White Shadow that she wrote a song about her grandfather 's death and its impact on her . Gaga spoke to Jon Pareles of The New York Times about the story behind the song : 
 " [ ' The Edge of Glory ' ] was about how when my grandma was standing over my grandfather while he was dying . There was this moment where I felt like he had sort of looked at her and reckoned that he had won in life . Like , ' I 'm a champion . We won . Our love made us a winner . ' They were married 60 years . I thought about that idea , that the glorious moment of your life is when you decide that it 's okay to go , you don ’ t have any more words to say , more business , more mountains to climb . You 're on the cliff , you tip your hat to yourself and you go . That ’ s what it was for me in that moment when I witnessed it . " 
 More information in regards to " The Edge of Glory " was revealed by Gaga , in an interview with Google where she explained the song as being about one 's final moments on earth , before death . Another inspiration for the song was actor Sylvester Stallone 's 1976 film Rocky , which was Gaga 's favorite film . The singer felt that the song was about looking at life directly , with the feeling that he or she is a champion — like the emotion displayed by the character Rocky Balboa in the film . 
 On May 5 , 2011 , Interscope sent out an e @-@ mail to radio stations across the United States , which stated that " The Edge of Glory " was to be released on Monday , May 9 , 2011 , as the first of two promotional single for Born This Way . It was to serve as the first song in the " Countdown to Born This Way " promotion on iTunes Store . However , after its release to the digital stores , " The Edge of Glory " started selling a considerable amount of digital downloads , prompting Gaga to make it the third single from Born This Way . On her Twitter account Gaga revealed the cover for the single . It showed Gaga topless with her mouth open , wearing her facial prosthetics from the " Born This Way " cover , and her hair wildly cascading around her . 
 = = Recording and composition = = 
 " The Edge of Glory " features synthesizers executed in a style influenced by smooth jazz , as well as the inclusion of a saxophone solo . The song is less electronic and more straightforward pop , and the lyrics deals more of romance than individual inspiration . Garibay revealed that the song was recorded in Gaga 's natural vocal tone , and required just one take . She requested him to add the sound of heartbeat at the start of the track . Garibay said that the decision to add a saxophone solo was a " bold move " for Gaga , since contemporary hit radio did not have any song with a saxophone solo on their song playlists . 
 A pop and disco song , " The Edge of Glory " opens with Gaga 's vocals over a keyboard , singing the line : " There ain 't no reason you and me should be alone tonight , yeah baby , tonight , yeah baby . " According to MTV 's Jocelyn Vena , the song 's production evokes the late ' 80s , early ' 90s adult @-@ contemporary pop , when big choruses were the norm for songs . Jason Lipshultz from Billboard stated the song " leans upon sunny electronica " that sounds big on the chorus , where Gaga sings " I 'm on the edge of glory and I 'm hanging on a moment of truth " . Evan Sawdey of the website PopMatters found several rock elements in the composition of the song . Vena also felt that what made the song stand out from others on the radio was the saxophone solo by Clemons right in the middle of the track , as Gaga belts out , " I 'm on the edge with you . " Robert Copsey from Digital Spy said that the musical composition is a mixture of loud @-@ sounding electric guitars and club @-@ beat influenced synths . The song and album ends with a long coda , with the sound of the saxophone fading out . 
 According to sheet music published at Musicnotes.com by Sony / ATV Music Publishing , " The Edge of Glory " is written in common time with a tempo of 128 beats per minute . Set in the key of A major , it follows the basic chord progression of A – E – D for the verse and A – E – F ♯ m – D progression for the chorus , while Gaga 's voice spans from A3 to D5 Gaga 's references for the saxophone solo was E Street Band and Bruce Springsteen hence she ultimately asked Clarence Clemons from E Street Band to play the instrument . Clemons told Rolling Stone that in January 2011 , he was contacted by Gaga 's management and they wanted him to play on Born This Way . Since the call was on a Friday , Clemons replied that he could record it on the coming Monday or Tuesday , but Gaga was adamant to have him at the New York recording studio on that day itself . Clemons flew from Florida to New York , and reached the recording studio in Manhattan at midnight . Gaga wanted him to play saxophone on multiple tracks , one of them being " The Edge of Glory " . She simply told Clemons , " We 'll put the tape on and you just play " . The recording concluded by 3 am in the morning after a few takes . Clemons added that he was surprised to get paid , since he " would have done it for free . I can never believe something that feels so good earns me money . "

 The Edge of Glory was met with general acclaim from critics . While previewing the song Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone wrote a positive review : " This one sounds crazy in print [ ... ] , but somehow it all seems totally natural when you actually hear it . " Perpetua added that there is an element of cheesiness in the song , but nevertheless , it is captivating and catchy when one listens to it . He complimented the inclusion of Clemons as an " inspired touch that amplifies the song 's Eighties stadium rock vibe , " and Clemons ' actual performance was described as amazing and among the best of his career . In another review , Perpetua noted that " The Edge of Glory " is " an immediate pop anthem " . Fellow Rolling Stone journalist Jody Rosen complimented the hook , the chorus and Clemens ' saxophone playing on the song . Jocelyn Vena from MTV News asserted that the song showed a softer side to Gaga , as opposed to her previous singles from Born This Way . Willa Paskin from New York was impressed with the track , saying : " If the first two tracks off the forthcoming Born This Way were all jangly dance @-@ rock , this is as smooth as an ' 80s jam straight off the Flashdance soundtrack , and it has the saxophone breakdown to prove it . " Paskin also believed that the song had potential to be a summer hit , but could face competition from singer Katy Perry 's single , " Last Friday Night ( T.G.I.F. ) " . 
 Jason Lipshutz of Billboard wrote that " The Edge of Glory " was " risk @-@ taking , [ but ] it 's focused on romance rather than individual inspiration . " Lewis Corner of Digital Spy awarded the song with five out of five stars and wrote : " Gaga belts over a chorus tastier and more filling than a meatball sub – stuffed with stadium @-@ sized beats and massive techno synths ; while the side of sax solo courtesy of the late Clarence Clemons is bound to seduce many a <unk> into bringing out their rarely @-@ used @-@ nowadays air sax . " Kevin O 'Donnell of Spin noted that in the song , Gaga " goes back to basics " . He also called the song a " four @-@ on @-@ the @-@ floor anthem with loads of references to ' 80s pop music " and concluded " Thankfully , ' Edge of Glory ' proves Gaga hasn 't let her global celebrity get the best of her art , and she 's still capable to cranking out straightforward , dance @-@ ready jams like ' Just Dance ' or ' Poker Face ' . " Both Andy Gill of The Independent and James Reed of The Boston Globe praised Clarence Clemons ' saxophone solo in " The Edge of Glory " . 
 <unk> Saad from Los Angeles Times asserted that " The Edge of Glory " was less shock @-@ provoking than her previous releases . Saad also felt that the track was slower and less electro in its composition than " Judas " , her then current single . Priya Elan of NME wrote that the song felt like a " pop moment " without Gaga trying too hard to address social issues or religious conflicts ; Elan also complimented Clemons ' saxophone addition . Similar sentiments were expressed by fellow NME writer Dan Martin , who found the track to be gleaming , calling it the " most ecstatic pop serenade " Gaga has ever come up with . Robert Copsey from Digital Spy commented that the song is a " straight @-@ up fists @-@ in @-@ the @-@ air feel @-@ good anthem that is less cheesy than ' Born This Way ' but equally ( if not more ) euphoric . " However , he found similarity in the opening bar of the song with that of Cher 's 2002 single " Song for the Lonely " . 
 Megan Gibson from Time was disappointed with the single , feeling that it was not " particularly good " , and called the music as trite , uninspiring and bland . Matthew Cole from Slant Magazine was polarized with the song , stating that while it lowered his expectations for the album , he expressed that the saxophone solo was " admittedly a high point , and one of the more original ideas that Gaga has had of late . " Sal Cinquemani , from the same publication , felt that the song " isn 't retro so much as retrograde , starting off with some crafty Art of Noise synth tones before morphing into what sounds like the theme song to an early- ' 90s sitcom , or an inspirational sports flick , as sung by Bonnie Tyler . " Greg Kot of Chicago Tribune also gave a mixed review about the song , calling it a " Springsteen @-@ on @-@ steroids bombast " and adding that it features " Clarence Clemons doing almost a parody of a Clarence Clemons sax solo .

 " The Edge of Glory " was nominated in the category for Song of the Year at the 38th People 's Choice Awards . At the end of 2011 , Slant Magazine listed " The Edge of Glory " as the eighth best song of the year , with Ed Gonzalez from the website commenting that the song is " a study in radical contrast that , once you sift aside its deliberately dated effects and the legacy of the late Clarence Clemons , is deep down an incredibly delicate ballad . Yes , everyone expects Gaga to make her confessions on the dance floor , but who knew she could make her shouts whisper ? " It was placed at the same rank by Billboard , and at position seven by Rolling Stone .

 At the BMI Pop Music Awards , Gaga 's choreographer Laurieann Gibson said that they would be filming the music video for " The Edge of Glory " soon . While she did not reveal much about the music video concept , she added : " I just know that we 'll be feeling very fishy . " Gaga told MTV UK that she had already written the treatment for the video , adding that it 's her favorite . E ! Online reported that a casting call for the video was made , where the agents looked for a Puerto Rican or Dominican origin male . Other roles included a male or female on @-@ air reporter , a doctor role reminiscent to the one in the American show Dr. 90210 , and a group of military men for scenes involving rifles . The music video director was confirmed as Joseph Kahn , but Interscope Records later confirmed that Kahn and Gaga parted ways due to collaborative misunderstandings . Gibson confirmed that there was " some issues on the set " , which resulted in Kahn being replaced as the director . 
 Gaga 's creative team Haus of Gaga were later chosen to direct the video instead . Chancler Haynes , Kahn 's on @-@ set editor revealed that the mermaid @-@ themed performance of the song , on Le Grand Journal was the actual theme of the video , and included sets built for a hospital scene , Brooklyn Bridge , and a big underwater mermaid scene . However , at the last minute before shooting , Gaga changed her mind regarding the whole concept , leading to a disagreement with Kahn , and hence it was cancelled . She then shot the scenes with Clarence Clemons in a New York City set . She later explained that her idea was to create a " sweater set of a video " . She wanted to acknowledge herself and the success she had experienced in her music career , with a simplified video showing her dancing outside her New York apartment from her early days . The music video premiered on June 16 , 2011 , on the eighth season of US reality television show , So You Think You Can Dance . 
 = = = Synopsis = = = 
 Gaga 's wardrobe throughout the entire video primarily consists of only one outfit which was designed by Gianni Versace . The dress consists of a S & M inspired outfit , with heavy gold jewelry , studs on the leather , and vibrant nail polish and lipstick . Notable in the video is the absence of back @-@ up dancers , elaborate choreography , or a symbolic plot : components that have all been predominant in Gaga 's other music videos . Aside from Gaga herself , Clemons is the only other person to appear in the video . 
 The video begins with Gaga slowly appearing from behind a building on a deserted street corner . The whole scenario is bathed in red and violet lights , coming from the windows of the buildings and alleyways as steam billows out from the drains . When the first verse of the song begins , Gaga emerges from the window of an apartment onto the fire escape . A long take follows , of Gaga strutting through the red @-@ lit district singing the line " I got a reason that you should take me home tonight " , and a shock of black hair falls in her eyes . Gaga does not remove it and the shot spans to her walking backside , gesturing the viewer to follow . The video consists mostly of interchanging shots of Gaga dancing and singing on the street , on the fire escape , and on the steps in front of the apartment building with Clemons . Near the end of the video , after Clemons ' saxophone solo , Gaga crouches in front of the building 's steps and kisses the sidewalk . The video concludes with a close @-@ up of Gaga 's face , before she re @-@ enters through the window into her smokey apartment .

 Both Jocelyn Vena from MTV and Christian Blauvelt from Entertainment Weekly commented on the similarity of the music video with the Broadway musical , Rent . Vena also compared the visuals with those for Madonna 's 1986 single " Papa Don 't Preach " and Michael Jackson 's 1984 single , " Billie Jean " . She concluded by saying that the music video " still manages to shine , mostly because of its simplicity " . In another review , James Montgomery from MTV , also found similarities between the video and the musicals Rent and West Side Story . Blauvelt was initially surprised to see the simplistic approach of the video , since her previous releases had provocative visuals . He added that the video seemed a " clear homage " to Gaga 's inspirations like Madonna , concluding that " all the references in ' The Edge of Glory ' are so overt , there 's no way it could be shameless cribbing . " 
 Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine gave the video a positive review , calling it a " visual triumph " , with " breathtaking " art direction , and a " gray @-@ blue @-@ black color palette carefully calibrated by Gaga 's vibrant lipstick and nail polish , a red painted stripe on the curb , and the gold of her jewelry and the studs on her leather , not to mention Clarence Clemons 's brass . " The video was compared to Michael Jackson 's " The Way You Make Me Feel , " Janet Jackson 's " When I Think of You " and " The Pleasure Principle " , and the film , Crimes of Passion , all of them being 1980s videos and films . He did , however , criticize Gaga 's " half @-@ convincing " lip @-@ synching . Writing for The Washington Post , Sarah Anne Hughes called the video " shockingly simple " . Amos Barshad from New York liked the straight approach Gaga took with the video , and although he called it boring compared to Gaga 's previous efforts , he felt the video worked well because of the simplicity . 
 Jarett Wieselman from New York Post tried to understand what actually went wrong with the production , and came to the conclusion that the mutual disagreements between Gaga and Kahn led to the video being a " piece of rubbish " . He deemed the whole issue surrounding the production as " foolish " , in the end agreeing that " it was foolish of us to expect that GaGa would never stumble because , despite the preternatural image constantly presented , she is only human after all . " Rolling Stone 's Daniel Kreps gave a mixed review of the video , calling the song " over @-@ the @-@ top " with a " lackluster " and " understated " video . Dose 's Leah Collins was more neutral in her review , questioning if Gaga was simply " swooning with nostalgia for other pop culture nuggets that have featured the same NYC backdrop of fire escapes and brown @-@ stone steps " or just attempting to " be saving a metric <unk> on the budget " . While reviewing the video for The Vancouver Sun , Collins compared Gaga 's look in the video to a " hooker " from the 1982 American science fiction film , Blade Runner . 
 = = Live performances = = 
 Gaga first performed an acoustic @-@ jazz version of the song at Radio 1 's Big Weekend in Carlisle , Cumbria on May 15 , 2011 . During the song , she revealed that her record company had told her to keep new material to a minimum , but she said she wanted to air the track in full . Another piano version of the song was performed on May 21 , 2011 , on the season finale of Saturday Night Live , where Gaga wore a metallic black dress , knee @-@ high boots and a semi @-@ circular metallic headdress . The full version was first performed at the final show of American Idol season 10 on May 25 , 2011 , where she was joined by Clemons in person . Gaga appeared perched atop a mountain top on the " Idol " stage , dressed in a long cape and a bedazzled headpiece . A trio of dancers were at the base of the set performing choreographed dance steps while Gaga sang from the top . At the end of the performance , Gaga and a dancer embraced each other , took a breath and then jumped off the edge of the stage , landing out of sight on a bed of fake rocks , as steam shot up high in the air . Len <unk> from The Star @-@ Ledger felt that the performance was too " sexually suggestive " for the audience of American Idol and wondered whether Gaga " went just a little too far for a family @-@ oriented show that 's geared toward a younger audience ? " Conversely , Adam Graham from MTV News listed it as one of Gaga 's most memorable television performances . Monica Herrera from Billboard listed it as the fourth best performance of the night , and felt that Gaga " channeled Bruce Springsteen " in her personality . 
 On May 27 , 2011 , Gaga performed " The Edge of Glory " on Good Morning America as a part of their " Summer Concert Series " , wearing a full black dress . At the sixth cycle of Germany 's Next Topmodel , Gaga performed the song on the final show . The performance included a segment where Gaga was portrayed as getting beheaded in a guillotine . Gaga then jumped up with a prosthetic head held aloft , before snarling towards the judges " I would kill for fashion " . The whole show was broadcast worldwide on the internet . An acoustic version was later performed at the <unk> 2011 in Rome , along with " Born This Way " . At the X Factor show in Paris , Gaga performed it along with " Judas " . She wore a fringed dress with long hair extensions and a long blue wig , while playing a keytar . At the French television show , Le Grand Journal , a mermaid themed performance of " The Edge of Glory " was televised . Gaga re @-@ created the New York City fire escape sets for the performance of the song on the Paul O 'Grady Live show . Ryan Love of Digital Spy had an advance preview of the recording of the show , and complimented the choreography by Gaga and her dancer , during the saxophone interlude . 
 Gaga opened the 2011 MuchMusic Video Awards with a performance of the song , sporting a bejeweled catsuit and a bob teal colored wig . While on tour in Japan , Gaga performed " The Edge of Glory " and " Born This Way " at the 2011 MTV Video Music Aid Japan . She started the performance while hanging from a giant spider web , with her aquamarine hair extensions stuck in it . Beginning to sing , Gaga pulled and tugged at the web , and ultimately broke free to join her dancers as she finished the performance . On October 16 , 2011 she performed the song during a concert at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles for the Clinton Foundation . She performed the song as the encore to her 2012 Born This Way Ball tour in which she plays the beginning of the song on piano atop a watch tower .

 American pop singer Nick Jonas sang an acoustic version of the song in July during his concert at the Westfield Century City in Los Angeles . Before the performance Jonas announced : " Do you guys mind if I play a couple of songs I like from pop radio right now ? Would that be OK ? The only problem is , I don 't know all the words . So if you know them , sing along . " After watching the performance online , Gaga posted his cover on her Twitter account along with the words " Swoon ! Nick Jonas singing The Edge of Glory . On my way to press conference in Taichung , listening to it . So dreamy ! X. " British band Friendly Fires covered the song during BBC Radio 1 's Live Lounge . Kevin O 'Donnell of Spin praised their cover writing : " Gaga 's original showcases the pop star 's gale force pipes , and Friendly Fires frontman Ed Macfarlane doesn 't try to match that energy . Instead , they offer a lovely , cinematic take on the song : Macfarlane croons with the heart @-@ on @-@ sleeve sensitivity of an emo @-@ boy over cascading synth melodies and a breezy funk pulse .

 = Enceladus = 
 Enceladus ( pronounced / <unk> / ) is the sixth @-@ largest moon of Saturn . It is approximately 500 kilometers ( 310 mi ) in diameter , about a tenth of that of Saturn 's largest moon , Titan . Enceladus is mostly covered by fresh , clean ice , reflecting almost all the sunlight that strikes it , making its surface temperature at noon reach only − 198 ° C ( − 324 @.@ 4 ° F ) . Despite its small size , Enceladus has a wide range of surface features , ranging from old , heavily cratered regions to young , tectonically deformed terrains that formed as recently as 100 million years ago . 
 Enceladus was discovered in 1789 by William Herschel , but little was known about it until the two Voyager spacecraft passed nearby in the early 1980s . In 2005 , the Cassini spacecraft started multiple close flybys of Enceladus , revealing its surface and environment in greater detail . In particular , Cassini discovered water @-@ rich plumes venting from the south polar region . <unk> near the south pole shoot geyser @-@ like jets of water vapor , other volatiles , and solid material , including sodium chloride crystals and ice particles , into space , totaling approximately 200 kilograms ( 440 lb ) per second . Over 100 geysers have been identified . Some of the water vapor falls back as " snow " ; the rest escapes , and supplies most of the material making up Saturn 's E ring . According to NASA scientists , the plumes are similar in composition to comets . In 2014 , NASA reported that Cassini found evidence for a large south polar subsurface ocean of liquid water with a thickness of around 10 km ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) . 
 These geyser observations , along with the finding of escaping internal heat and very few ( if any ) impact craters in the south polar region , show that Enceladus is geologically active today . Like many other satellites in the extensive systems of the giant planets , Enceladus is trapped in an orbital resonance . Its resonance with Dione excites its orbital eccentricity , which is damped by tidal forces , tidally heating its interior , and possibly driving the geological activity . 
 = = History = = 
 = = = Discovery = = = 
 Enceladus was discovered by Fredrick William Herschel on August 28 , 1789 , during the first use of his new 1 @.@ 2 m ( 47 in ) telescope , then the largest in the world . Its faint apparent magnitude ( HV = + 11 @.@ 7 ) and its proximity to the much brighter Saturn and Saturn 's rings make Enceladus difficult to observe from Earth with smaller telescopes . Like many satellites of Saturn discovered prior to the Space Age , Enceladus was first observed during a Saturnian equinox , when Earth is within the ring plane . At such times , the reduction in glare from the rings makes the moons easier to observe . Prior to the Voyager missions the view of Enceladus improved little from the dot first observed by Herschel . Only its orbital characteristics were known , with estimations of its mass , density and albedo . 
 = = = Naming = = = 
 Enceladus is named after the giant Enceladus of Greek mythology . The name , like the names of each of the first seven satellites of Saturn to be discovered , was suggested by William Herschel 's son John Herschel in his 1847 publication Results of Astronomical Observations made at the Cape of Good Hope . He chose these names because Saturn , known in Greek mythology as Cronus , was the leader of the Titans . 
 Features on Enceladus are named by the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) after characters and places from Burton 's translation of The Book of One Thousand and One Nights . Impact craters are named after characters , whereas other feature types , such as fossae ( long , narrow depressions ) , dorsa ( ridges ) , <unk> ( plains ) , and sulci ( long parallel grooves ) , are named after places . The IAU has officially named 85 features on Enceladus , most recently Samaria <unk> , formerly called Samaria Fossa . 
 = = Orbit and rotation = = 
 Enceladus is one of the major inner satellites of Saturn along with Dione , Tethys , and Mimas . It orbits at 238 @,@ 000 km from Saturn 's center and 180 @,@ 000 km from its cloud tops , between the orbits of Mimas and Tethys . It orbits Saturn every 32 @.@ 9 hours , fast enough for its motion to be observed over a single night of observation . Enceladus is currently in a 2 : 1 mean @-@ motion orbital resonance with Dione , completing two orbits around Saturn for every one orbit completed by Dione . This resonance maintains Enceladus 's orbital eccentricity ( 0 @.@ 0047 ) , which is known as a forced eccentricity . This non @-@ zero eccentricity results in tidal deformation of Enceladus . The dissipated heat resulting from this deformation is the main heating source for Enceladus 's geologic activity . Enceladus orbits within the densest part of Saturn 's E ring , the outermost of its major rings , and is the main source of the ring 's material composition . 
 Like most of Saturn 's larger satellites , Enceladus rotates synchronously with its orbital period , keeping one face pointed toward Saturn . Unlike Earth 's Moon , Enceladus does not appear to librate about its spin axis ( more than 1 @.@ 5 ° ) . However , analysis of the shape of Enceladus suggests that at some point it was in a 1 : 4 forced secondary spin – orbit libration . This libration could have provided Enceladus with an additional heat source . 
 = = = Source of the E ring = = = 
 Plumes from Enceladus , which are similar in composition to comets , have been shown to be the source of the material in Saturn 's E ring . The E ring is the widest and outermost ring of Saturn ( except for the tenuous Phoebe ring ) . It is an extremely wide but diffuse disk of microscopic icy or dusty material distributed between the orbits of Mimas and Titan . 
 Mathematical models show that the E ring is unstable , with a lifespan between 10 @,@ 000 and 1 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 years ; therefore , particles composing it must be constantly replenished . Enceladus is orbiting inside the ring , at its narrowest but highest density point , raising suspicion since the 1980s that Enceladus is the main source of particles for the ring . This hypothesis was confirmed by Cassini 's first two close flybys in 2005 . 
 = = Geology = = 
 = = = Surface features = = = 
 Voyager 2 was the first spacecraft to observe the surface in detail , in August 1981 . Examination of the resulting highest @-@ resolution imagery revealed at least five different types of terrain , including several regions of cratered terrain , regions of smooth ( young ) terrain , and lanes of ridged terrain often bordering the smooth areas . In addition , extensive linear cracks and scarps were observed . Given the relative lack of craters on the smooth plains , these regions are probably less than a few hundred million years old . Accordingly , Enceladus must have been recently active with " water volcanism " or other processes that renew the surface . The fresh , clean ice that dominates its surface gives Enceladus probably the most reflective surface of any body in the Solar System with a visual geometric albedo of 1 @.@ 38 . Because it reflects so much sunlight , the mean surface temperature at noon only reaches − 198 ° C ( − 324 @.@ 4 ° F ) , making it somewhat colder than other Saturnian satellites . 
 Observations during three flybys by Cassini on February 17 , March 9 , and July 14 , 2005 , revealed Enceladus 's surface features in much greater detail than the Voyager 2 observations . The smooth plains , which Voyager 2 had observed , resolved into relatively crater @-@ free regions filled with numerous small ridges and scarps . Numerous fractures were found within the older , cratered terrain , suggesting that the surface has been subjected to extensive deformation since the craters were formed . Some areas contain no craters , indicating major resurfacing events in the geologically recent past . There are fissures , plains , corrugated terrain and other crustal deformations . Several additional regions of young terrain were discovered in areas not well @-@ imaged by either Voyager spacecraft , such as the bizarre terrain near the south pole . All of this indicates that Enceladus 's interior may be liquid today , even though it should have been frozen long ago . 
 = = = = Impact craters = = = = 
 Impact cratering is a common occurrence on many Solar System bodies . Much of Enceladus 's surface is covered with craters at various densities and levels of degradation . This subdivision of cratered terrains on the basis of crater density ( and thus surface age ) suggests that Enceladus has been resurfaced in multiple stages . 
 Cassini observations provided a much closer look at the crater distribution and size , showing that many of Enceladus 's craters are heavily degraded through viscous relaxation and fracturing . <unk> relaxation allows gravity , over geologic time scales , to deform craters and other topographic features formed in water ice , reducing the amount of topography over time . The rate at which this occurs is dependent on the temperature of the ice : warmer ice is easier to deform than colder , stiffer ice . <unk> relaxed craters tend to have domed floors , or are recognized as craters only by a raised , circular rim . <unk> crater is a prime example of a <unk> relaxed crater on Enceladus , with a prominent domed floor . 
 = = = = Tectonic features = = = = 
 Voyager 2 found several types of tectonic features on Enceladus , including troughs , scarps , and belts of grooves and ridges . Results from Cassini suggest that tectonics is the dominant mode of deformation on Enceladus , including rifts , one of the more dramatic types of tectonic features that were noted . These canyons can be up to 200 km long , 5 – 10 km wide , and 1 km deep . Such features are geologically young , because they cut across other tectonic features and have sharp topographic relief with prominent outcrops along the cliff faces . 
 Evidence of tectonics on Enceladus is also derived from grooved terrain , consisting of lanes of curvilinear grooves and ridges . These bands , first discovered by Voyager 2 , often separate smooth plains from cratered regions . Grooved terrains such as the Samarkand Sulci are reminiscent of grooved terrain on Ganymede . However , unlike those seen on Ganymede , grooved topography on Enceladus is generally more complex . Rather than parallel sets of grooves , these lanes often appear as bands of crudely aligned , chevron @-@ shaped features . In other areas , these bands bow upwards with fractures and ridges running the length of the feature . Cassini observations of the Samarkand Sulci have revealed dark spots ( 125 and 750 m wide ) located parallel to the narrow fractures . Currently , these spots are interpreted as collapse pits within these ridged plain belts . 
 In addition to deep fractures and grooved lanes , Enceladus has several other types of tectonic terrain . Many of these fractures are found in bands cutting across cratered terrain . These fractures probably propagate down only a few hundred meters into the crust . Many have probably been influenced during their formation by the weakened regolith produced by impact craters , often changing the strike of the propagating fracture . Another example of tectonic features on Enceladus are the linear grooves first found by Voyager 2 and seen at a much higher resolution by Cassini . These linear grooves can be seen cutting across other terrain types , like the groove and ridge belts . Like the deep rifts , they are among the youngest features on Enceladus . However , some linear grooves have been softened like the craters nearby , suggesting that they are older . Ridges have also been observed on Enceladus , though not nearly to the extent as those seen on Europa . These ridges are relatively limited in extent and are up to one kilometer tall . One @-@ kilometer high domes have also been observed . Given the level of resurfacing found on Enceladus , it is clear that tectonic movement has been an important driver of geology for much of its history . 
 = = = = Smooth plains = = = = 
 Two regions of smooth plains were observed by Voyager 2 . They generally have low relief and have far fewer craters than in the cratered terrains , indicating a relatively young surface age . In one of the smooth plain regions , Sarandib Planitia , no impact craters were visible down to the limit of resolution . Another region of smooth plains to the southwest of Sarandib is criss @-@ crossed by several troughs and scarps . Cassini has since viewed these smooth plains regions , like Sarandib Planitia and Diyar Planitia at much higher resolution . Cassini images show these regions filled with low @-@ relief ridges and fractures , probably caused by shear deformation . The high @-@ resolution images of Sarandib Planitia revealed a number of small impact craters , which allow for an estimate of the surface age , either 170 million years or 3 @.@ 7 billion years , depending on assumed impactor population . 
 The expanded surface coverage provided by Cassini has allowed for the identification of additional regions of smooth plains , particularly on Enceladus 's leading hemisphere ( the side of Enceladus that faces the direction of motion as it orbits Saturn ) . Rather than being covered in low @-@ relief ridges , this region is covered in numerous criss @-@ crossing sets of troughs and ridges , similar to the deformation seen in the south polar region . This area is on the opposite side of Enceladus from Sarandib and Diyar <unk> , suggesting that the placement of these regions is influenced by Saturn 's tides on Enceladus . 
 = = = = South polar region = = = = 
 Images taken by Cassini during the flyby on July 14 , 2005 , revealed a distinctive , tectonically deformed region surrounding Enceladus 's south pole . This area , reaching as far north as 60 ° south latitude , is covered in tectonic fractures and ridges . The area has few sizable impact craters , suggesting that it is the youngest surface on Enceladus and on any of the mid @-@ sized icy satellites ; modeling of the cratering rate suggests that some regions of the south polar terrain are possibly as young as 500 @,@ 000 years or less . Near the center of this terrain are four fractures bounded by ridges , unofficially called " tiger stripes " . They appear to be the youngest features in this region and are surrounded by mint @-@ green @-@ colored ( in false color , UV – green – near IR images ) , coarse @-@ grained water ice , seen elsewhere on the surface within outcrops and fracture walls . Here the " blue " ice is on a flat surface , indicating that the region is young enough not to have been coated by fine @-@ grained water ice from the E ring . Results from the visual and infrared spectrometer ( VIMS ) instrument suggest that the green @-@ colored material surrounding the tiger stripes is chemically distinct from the rest of the surface of Enceladus . VIMS detected crystalline water ice in the stripes , suggesting that they are quite young ( likely less than 1 @,@ 000 years old ) or the surface ice has been thermally altered in the recent past . VIMS also detected simple organic ( carbon @-@ containing ) compounds in the tiger stripes , chemistry not found anywhere else on Enceladus thus far . One of these areas of " blue " ice in the south polar region was observed at high resolution during the July 14 flyby , revealing an area of extreme tectonic deformation and blocky terrain , with some areas covered in boulders 10 – 100 m across . 
 The boundary of the south polar region is marked by a pattern of parallel , <unk> and V @-@ shaped ridges and valleys . The shape , orientation , and location of these features suggest they are caused by changes in the overall shape of Enceladus . As of 2006 there were two theories for what could cause such a shift in shape : the orbit of Enceladus may have migrated inward , leading to an increase in Enceladus 's rotation rate . Such a shift would lead to a more oblate shape ; or a rising mass of warm , low @-@ density material in Enceladus 's interior may have led to a shift in the position of the current south polar terrain from Enceladus 's southern mid @-@ latitudes to its south pole . Consequently , the moon 's ellipsoid shape would have adjusted to match the new orientation . One problem of the polar flattening hypothesis is that both polar regions should have similar tectonic deformation histories . However , the north polar region is densely cratered , and has a much older surface age than the south pole . Thickness variations in Enceladus 's lithosphere is one explanation for this discrepancy . Variations in lithospheric thickness are supported by the correlation between the Y @-@ shaped discontinuities and the V @-@ shaped cusps along the south polar terrain margin and the relative surface age of the adjacent non @-@ south polar terrain regions . The Y @-@ shaped discontinuities , and the north @-@ south trending tension fractures into which they lead , are correlated with younger terrain with presumably thinner <unk> . The V @-@ shaped cusps are adjacent to older , more heavily cratered terrains . 
 = = = Internal structure = = = 
 Before the Cassini mission , little was known about the interior of Enceladus . However , flybys by Cassini provided information for models of Enceladus 's interior , including a better determination of the mass and shape , high @-@ resolution observations of the surface , and new insights on the interior . 
 Mass estimates from the Voyager program missions suggested that Enceladus was composed almost entirely of water ice . However , based on the effects of Enceladus 's gravity on Cassini , its mass was determined to be much higher than previously thought , yielding a density of 1 @.@ 61 g / cm3 . This density is higher than Saturn 's other mid @-@ sized icy satellites , indicating that Enceladus contains a greater percentage of silicates and iron . 
 Castillo et al . ( 2005 ) suggested that Iapetus and the other icy satellites of Saturn formed relatively quickly after the formation of the Saturnian subnebula , and thus were rich in short @-@ lived radionuclides . These radionuclides , like aluminium @-@ 26 and iron @-@ 60 , have short half @-@ lives and would produce interior heating relatively quickly . Without the short @-@ lived variety , Enceladus 's complement of long @-@ lived radionuclides would not have been enough to prevent rapid freezing of the interior , even with Enceladus 's comparatively high rock – mass fraction , given its small size . Given Enceladus 's relatively high rock – mass fraction , the proposed enhancement in 26Al and 60Fe would result in a differentiated body , with an icy mantle and a rocky core . Subsequent radioactive and tidal heating would raise the temperature of the core to 1 @,@ 000 K , enough to melt the inner mantle . However , for Enceladus to still be active , part of the core must have also melted , forming magma chambers that would flex under the strain of Saturn 's tides . Tidal heating , such as from the resonance with Dione or from libration , would then have sustained these hot spots in the core and would power the current geological activity . 
 In addition to its mass and modeled geochemistry , researchers have also examined Enceladus 's shape to determine if it is differentiated . Porco et al . ( 2006 ) used limb measurements to determine that its shape , assuming hydrostatic equilibrium , is consistent with an undifferentiated interior , in contradiction to the geological and geochemical evidence . However , the current shape also supports the possibility that Enceladus is not in hydrostatic equilibrium , and may have rotated faster at some point in the recent past ( with a differentiated interior ) . Gravity measurements by Cassini show that the density of the core is low , indicating that the core contains water in addition to silicates . 
 = = = = Subsurface water ocean = = = = 
 Evidence of liquid water on Enceladus began to accumulate in 2005 , when scientists observed plumes containing water vapor spewing from its south polar surface , with jets moving 250 kg of water vapor every second at up to 2 @,@ 189 km / h ( 1 @,@ 360 mph ) into space . Soon after , in 2006 it was determined that Enceladus 's plumes are the source of Saturn 's E Ring . The sources of salty particles are uniformly distributed along the tiger stripes , whereas sources of " fresh " particles are closely related to the high @-@ speed gas jets . The " salty " particles are heavier and mostly fall back to the surface , whereas the fast " fresh " particles escape to the E ring , explaining its salt @-@ poor composition of 0 @.@ 5 – 2 % of sodium salts by mass . The plumes ' " salty " composition indicates that the source is a salty subsurface ocean . Cassini also found traces of simple organic compounds in some dust grains . 
 <unk> data from Cassini 's December 2010 flybys showed that Enceladus likely has a liquid water ocean beneath its frozen surface , but at the time it was thought the subsurface ocean was limited to the south pole . The top of the ocean <unk> lies beneath a 30 to 40 kilometers ( 19 to 25 mi ) thick ice shelf . The ocean may be 10 kilometers ( 6 @.@ 2 mi ) deep at the south pole . 
 Measurements of Enceladus 's " wobble " as it orbits Saturn — called libration — suggests that the entire icy crust is detached from the rocky core and therefore that a global ocean is present beneath the surface . The amount of libration ( 0 @.@ 120 ° ± 0 @.@ 014 ° ) implies that this global ocean is about 26 to 31 kilometers deep . For comparison , Earth 's ocean has an average depth of 3 @.@ 7 kilometers . 
 A model suggests that Enceladus 's salty ocean ( <unk> , <unk> , <unk> ) has an alkaline pH of 11 to 12 . The high pH is interpreted to be a consequence of serpentinization of chondritic rock that leads to the generation of H2 , a geochemical source of energy that can support both abiotic and biological synthesis of organic molecules such as those that have been detected in Enceladus 's plumes .

 Following Voyager 's encounters with Enceladus in the early 1980s , scientists postulated that it may be geologically active based on its young , reflective surface and location near the core of the E ring . Based on the connection between Enceladus and the E ring , scientists suspected that Enceladus was the source of material in the E ring , perhaps through venting of water vapor . Readings from Cassini 's 2005 passage suggested that cryovolcanism , where water and other volatiles are the materials erupted instead of silicate rock , had been discovered on Enceladus . The first Cassini sighting of a plume of icy particles above Enceladus 's south pole came from the Imaging Science Subsystem ( ISS ) images taken in January and February 2005 , though the possibility of a camera artifact delayed an official announcement . Data from the magnetometer instrument during the February 17 , 2005 , encounter provided a hint that the feature might be real when it found evidence for a planetary atmosphere . The magnetometer observed an increase in the power of ion cyclotron waves near Enceladus . These waves are produced by the interaction of ionized particles and magnetic fields , and the waves ' frequency can be used to identify their composition , in this case ionized water vapor . During the two following encounters , the magnetometer team determined that gases in Enceladus 's atmosphere are concentrated over the south polar region , with atmospheric density away from the pole being much lower . The Ultraviolet Imaging Spectrograph ( UVIS ) confirmed this result by observing two stellar occultations during the February 17 and July 14 encounters . Unlike the magnetometer , UVIS failed to detect an atmosphere above Enceladus during the February encounter when it looked over the equatorial region , but did detect water vapor during an occultation over the south polar region during the July encounter . 
 Fortuitously , Cassini flew through this gas cloud during the July 14 encounter , allowing instruments such as the ion and neutral mass spectrometer ( INMS ) and the cosmic dust analyzer ( CDA ) to directly sample the plume . INMS measured the composition of the gas cloud , detecting mostly water vapor , as well as traces of molecular nitrogen , methane , and carbon dioxide . The CDA " detected a large increase in the number of particles near Enceladus " , confirming Enceladus as the primary source for the E ring . Analysis of the CDA and INMS data suggest that the gas cloud Cassini flew through during the July encounter , and observed from a distance with its magnetometer and UVIS , was actually a water @-@ rich cryovolcanic plume , originating from vents near the south pole . 
 Visual confirmation of venting came in November 2005 , when ISS imaged geyser @-@ like jets of icy particles rising from Enceladus 's south polar region . ( Although the plume was imaged before , in January and February 2005 , additional studies of the camera 's response at high phase angles , when the Sun is almost behind Enceladus , and comparison with equivalent high @-@ phase @-@ angle images taken of other Saturnian satellites , were required before this could be confirmed . ) The November 2005 images showed the plume 's fine structure , revealing numerous jets ( perhaps issuing from numerous distinct vents ) within a larger , faint component extending out nearly 500 km from the surface . The particles have a bulk velocity of 1 @.@ 25 ± 0 @.@ 1 km / s . Cassini 's UVIS later observed gas jets coinciding with the dust jets seen by ISS during a non @-@ targeted encounter with Enceladus in October 2007 . 
 Observations during a flyby on March 12 , 2008 , revealed additional chemicals in the plume , including trace amounts of simple hydrocarbons such as methane , propane , acetylene and formaldehyde . The plumes ' composition , as measured by the INMS , is similar to that seen at most comets . 
 The combined analysis of imaging , mass spectrometry , and magnetospheric data suggests that the observed south polar plume emanates from pressurized subsurface chambers , similar to Earth 's geysers , but the mechanism that drives and sustains the eruptions is unclear . The intensity of the eruption of the south polar jets varies significantly as a function of the position of Enceladus in its orbit . The plumes are about four times brighter when Enceladus is at apoapsis ( the point in its orbit most distant from Saturn ) than when it is at periapsis . This is consistent with geophysical calculations which predict the south polar fissures are under compression near periapsis , pushing them shut , and under tension near apoapsis , pulling them open . 
 Much of the plume activity consists of broad curtain @-@ like eruptions . Optical illusions from a combination of viewing direction and local fracture geometry previously made the plumes look like discrete jets .

 During the flyby of July 14 , 2005 , the Composite Infrared Spectrometer ( CIRS ) found a warm region near the south pole . Temperatures in this region ranged from 85 – 90 K , with small areas showing as high as 157 K ( − 116 ° C ) , much too warm to be explained by solar heating , indicating that parts of the south polar region are heated from the interior of Enceladus . The presence of a subsurface ocean under the south polar region is now accepted , but it cannot explain the source of the heat , with an estimated heat flux of 200 mW / m2 , which is about 10 times higher than that from radiogenic heating alone . 
 Several explanations for the observed elevated temperatures and the resulting plumes have been proposed , including venting from a subsurface reservoir of liquid water , sublimation of ice , decompression and dissociation of clathrates , and shear heating , but a complete explanation of all the heat sources causing the observed thermal power output of Enceladus has not yet been settled . 
 Heating in Enceladus has occurred through various mechanisms ever since its formation . Radioactive decay in its core may have initially heated it , giving it a warm core and a subsurface ocean , which is now kept above freezing through an unidentified mechanism . Geophysical models indicate that tidal heating is a main heat source , perhaps aided by radioactive decay and some heat @-@ producing chemical reactions . A 2007 study predicted the internal heat of Enceladus , if generated by tidal forces , could be no greater than 1 @.@ 1 gigawatts , but data from Cassini 's infrared spectrometer of the south polar terrain over 16 months , indicate that the internal heat generated power is about 4 @.@ 7 gigawatts , and suggest that it is in thermal equilibrium . 
 The observed power output of 4 @.@ 7 gigawatts is challenging to explain from tidal heating alone , so the main source of heat remains a mystery . Most scientists think the observed heat flux of Enceladus is not enough to maintain the subsurface ocean , and therefore any subsurface ocean must be a remnant of a period of higher eccentricity and tidal heating , or the heat is produced through another mechanism . 
 = = = = Tidal heating = = = = 
 Tidal heating occurs through the tidal friction processes : orbital and rotational energy are dissipated as heat in the crust of an object . In addition , to the extent that tides produce heat along fractures , libration may affect the magnitude and distribution of such tidal shear heating . Tidal dissipation of Enceladus 's ice crust is significant because Enceladus has a subsurface ocean . Scientific models of heating on Enceladus suggest that despite the increased heat from tidal dissipation , the total observed heating of Enceladus is not enough to maintain a subsurface ocean for more than 30 million years ( Enceladus is billions of years old ) , even if the ocean contains other chemical components that lower its freezing point . It is thought that if Enceladus had a more eccentric orbit in the past , the enhanced tidal forces could be sufficient to maintain a subsurface ocean , such that a periodic enhancement in eccentricity could maintain a subsurface ocean that periodically changes in size . Previous models suggest that resonant perturbations of Dione could provide the necessary periodic eccentricity changes to maintain the subsurface ocean of Enceladus , if the ocean contains a substantial amount of ammonia . The surface of Enceladus indicates that the entire moon has experienced periods of enhanced heat flux in the past . 
 = = = = Radioactive heating = = = = 
 The " hot start " model of heating suggests Enceladus began as ice and rock that contained rapidly decaying short @-@ lived radioactive isotopes of aluminium , iron and manganese . Enormous amounts of heat were then produced as these isotopes decayed for about 7 million years , resulting in the consolidation of rocky material at the core surrounded by a shell of ice . Although the heat from radioactivity would decrease over time , the combination of radioactivity and tidal forces from Saturn 's gravitational tug could prevent the subsurface ocean from freezing . The present @-@ day radiogenic heating rate is 3 @.@ 2 × 1015 ergs / s , assuming Enceladus has a composition of ice , iron and silicate materials . Heating from long @-@ lived radioactive isotopes uranium <unk> , <unk> , thorium <unk> and potassium <unk> inside Enceladus would add 0 @.@ 3 gigawatts to the observed heat flux . The presence of Enceladus 's regionally thick subsurface ocean suggests a heat flux ~ 10 times higher than that from radiogenic heating in the silicate core . 
 = = = = Chemistry = = = = 
 Because no ammonia was initially found in the vented material by INMS or UVIS , which could act as an anti @-@ freeze , it was thought such a heated , pressurized chamber would consist of nearly pure liquid water with a temperature of at least 270 K ( − 3 ° C ) , because pure water requires more energy to melt . In July 2009 it was announced that traces of ammonia had been found in the plumes during flybys in July and October 2008 . Reducing the freezing point of water with ammonia would also allow for outgassing and higher gas pressure , and less heat required to power the water plumes . The subsurface layer heating the surface water ice could be an ammonia – water slurry at temperatures as low as 170 K ( − 103 ° C ) , and thus less energy is required to produce the plume activity . However , the observed 4 @.@ 7 gigawatts heat flux is enough to power the cryovolcanism without the presence of ammonia .

 Enceladus is a relatively small satellite composed of ice and rock . It is a scalene ellipsoid in shape ; its diameters , calculated from images taken by Cassini 's ISS ( Imaging Science Subsystem ) instrument , are 513 km between the sub- and anti @-@ Saturnian poles , 503 km between the leading and trailing hemispheres , and 497 km between the north and south poles . Enceladus is only one @-@ seventh the diameter of Earth 's Moon . It ranks sixth in both mass and size among the satellites of Saturn , after Titan ( 5 @,@ 150 km ) , Rhea ( 1 @,@ 530 km ) , Iapetus ( 1 @,@ 440 km ) , Dione ( 1 @,@ 120 km ) and Tethys ( 1 @,@ 050 km ) .

 = = = Mimas – Enceladus paradox = = = 
 Mimas , the innermost of the round moons of Saturn and directly interior to Enceladus , is a geologically dead body , even though it should experience stronger tidal forces than Enceladus . This apparent paradox can be explained in part by temperature @-@ dependent properties of water ice ( the main constituent of the interiors of Mimas and Enceladus ) . The tidal heating per unit mass is given by the formula <formula> , where ρ is the ( mass ) density of the satellite , n is its mean orbital motion , r is the satellite 's radius , e is the orbital eccentricity of the satellite , μ is the shear modulus and Q is the dimensionless dissipation factor . For a same @-@ temperature approximation , the expected value of <unk> for Mimas is about 40 times that of Enceladus . However , the material parameters μ and Q are temperature dependent . At high temperatures ( close to the melting point ) , μ and Q are low , so tidal heating is high . Modeling suggests that for Enceladus , both a ' basic ' low @-@ energy thermal state with little internal temperature gradient , and an ' excited ' high @-@ energy thermal state with a significant temperature gradient , and consequent convection ( endogenic geologic activity ) , once established , would be stable . For Mimas , only a low @-@ energy state is expected to be stable , despite its being closer to Saturn . So the model predicts a low @-@ internal @-@ temperature state for Mimas ( values of μ and Q are high ) but a possible higher @-@ temperature state for Enceladus ( values of μ and Q are low ) . Additional historical information is needed to explain how Enceladus first entered the high @-@ energy state ( e.g. more radiogenic heating or a more eccentric orbit in the past ) . 
 The significantly higher density of Enceladus relative to Mimas ( 1 @.@ 61 vs. 1 @.@ 15 g / cm3 ) , implying a larger content of rock and more radiogenic heating in its early history , has also been cited as an important factor in resolving the Mimas paradox . 
 It has been suggested that for an icy satellite the size of Mimas or Enceladus to enter an ' excited state ' of tidal heating and convection , it would need to enter an orbital resonance before it lost too much of its primordial internal heat . Because Mimas , being smaller , would cool more rapidly than Enceladus , its window of opportunity for initiating orbital resonance @-@ driven convection would have been considerably shorter . 
 = = = Proto @-@ Enceladus hypothesis = = = 
 Enceladus is losing mass at a rate of 200 kg / second . If mass loss at this rate continued for 4 @.@ 5 Gyr , the satellite would have lost approximately 30 % of its initial mass . A similar value is obtained by assuming that the initial densities of Enceladus and Mimas were equal . It suggests that tectonics in the south polar region is probably mainly related to subsidence and associated subduction caused by the process of mass loss . 
 = = = Date of formation = = = 
 In 2016 , a study of how the orbits of Saturn 's moons should have changed due to tidal effects suggested that all of Saturn 's satellites inward of Titan , including Enceladus ( whose geologic activity was used to derive the strength of tidal effects on Saturn 's satellites ) , may have formed as little as 100 million years ago .

 Enceladus ejects plumes of salt water that are laced with grains of silica @-@ rich sand , nitrogen ( in ammonia ) , nutrients and organic molecules , including trace amounts of simple hydrocarbons such as methane ( CH

 8 ) , acetylene ( C 
 2H 
 2 ) and formaldehyde ( CH 
 2O ) , which are carbon @-@ bearing molecules . This indicates that hydrothermal activity — an energy source — may be at work in Enceladus 's subsurface ocean . In addition , models indicate the large rocky core is porous , allowing water to flow through it to pick up heat . 
 Molecular hydrogen ( H 
 2 ) , a geochemical source of energy that can be metabolized by methanogen microbes to provide energy for life , could be present if , as models suggest , Enceladus 's salty ocean has an alkaline pH from serpentinization of chondritic rock . 
 The presence of an internal global salty ocean with an aquatic environment supported by global ocean circulation patterns , with an energy source and simple organic compounds in contact with Enceladus 's rocky core , may advance the study of astrobiology and the study of potentially habitable environments for microbial extraterrestrial life . Therefore , several robotic missions have been proposed to further explore Enceladus and assess its habitability ; some of the proposed missions are : Journey to Enceladus and Titan , Enceladus Explorer , Enceladus Life Finder , and Life Investigation For Enceladus .

 The two Voyager spacecraft made the first close @-@ up images of Enceladus . Voyager 1 was the first to fly past Enceladus , at a distance of 202 @,@ 000 km on November 12 , 1980 . Images acquired from this distance had very poor spatial resolution , but revealed a highly reflective surface devoid of impact craters , indicating a youthful surface . Voyager 1 also confirmed that Enceladus was embedded in the densest part of Saturn 's diffuse E ring . Combined with the apparent youthful appearance of the surface , Voyager scientists suggested that the E ring consisted of particles vented from Enceladus 's surface . 
 Voyager 2 passed closer to Enceladus ( 87 @,@ 010 km ) on August 26 , 1981 , allowing higher @-@ resolution images to be obtained . These images showed a young surface . They also revealed a surface with different regions with vastly different surface ages , with a heavily cratered mid- to high @-@ northern latitude region , and a lightly cratered region closer to the equator . This geologic diversity contrasts with the ancient , heavily cratered surface of Mimas , another moon of Saturn slightly smaller than Enceladus . The geologically youthful terrains came as a great surprise to the scientific community , because no theory was then able to predict that such a small ( and cold , compared to Jupiter 's highly active moon Io ) celestial body could bear signs of such activity . 
 = = = Cassini = = = 
 The answers to many remaining mysteries of Enceladus had to wait until the arrival of the Cassini spacecraft on July 1 , 2004 , when it entered orbit around Saturn . Given the results from the Voyager 2 images , Enceladus was considered a priority target by the Cassini mission planners , and several targeted flybys within 1 @,@ 500 km of the surface were planned as well as numerous , " non @-@ targeted " opportunities within 100 @,@ 000 km of Enceladus . The flybys have yielded significant information concerning Enceladus 's surface , as well as the discovery of water vapor with traces of simple hydrocarbons venting from the geologically active south polar region . These discoveries prompted the adjustment of Cassini 's flight plan to allow closer flybys of Enceladus , including an encounter in March 2008 that took it to within 48 km of the surface . Cassini 's extended mission included seven close flybys of Enceladus between July 2008 and July 2010 , including two passes at only 50 km in the later half of 2008 . Cassini performed a flyby on October 28 , 2015 , passing as close as 49 km ( 30 mi ) and through a plume . Confirmation of molecular hydrogen ( H 
 2 ) would be an independent line of evidence that hydrothermal activity is taking place in the Enceladus seafloor , increasing its habitability . 
 Cassini has provided strong evidence that Enceladus has an ocean with an energy source , nutrients and organic molecules , making Enceladus one of the best places for the study of potentially habitable environments for extraterrestrial life . By contrast , the water thought to be on Jupiter 's moon Europa is located under a much thicker layer of ice .

 = United States Capitol cornerstone laying = 
 The United States Capitol cornerstone laying was the ceremonial placement of the cornerstone of the United States Capitol on September 18 , 1793 . The cornerstone was laid by president of the United States George Washington , assisted by the Grand Master of Maryland Joseph Clark , in a Masonic ritual . 
 Many of the items of ritual paraphernalia used in the cornerstone ceremony have been repurposed and are currently used for the placement of foundation stones at other important buildings in the greater Washington area . Centennial and bicentennial observances of the U.S. Capitol cornerstone laying were held in 1893 and 1993 , respectively , and a tricentennial observance of the ritual has been announced for 2093 .

 Workers began excavating the foundations of the United States Capitol in July 1793 . During construction of the foundation , building commissioner David Stuart wrote to other members of the capitol commission suggesting a cornerstone ceremony be held . At their September 2 meeting , the commission agreed with Stuart , setting a date for the ceremony a little more than two weeks later . 
 = = Ceremony = = 
 At 10 : 00 a.m. on September 18 , President of the United States George Washington and his entourage crossed the Potomac River to arrive in the city of Washington . There , they were joined by an escort consisting of the Alexandria Volunteer Artillery , and members of Masonic lodges from Virginia and Maryland , and proceeded to the construction grounds approximately 1 @.@ 5 miles ( 2 @.@ 4 km ) away . At the site of the Capitol , Washington was received by Joseph Clark , the Grand Master of the Grand Lodge of Maryland . A silver plaque , fashioned by Georgetown silversmith Caleb Bentley , was handed to Washington , who stepped into the foundation trench and placed the plaque , whereupon the cornerstone was lowered . The plaque was inscribed with a brief tribute to the " military valor and prudence " of Washington , and dedicated the building in the " first year , of the second term , of the presidency of George Washington ... and in the year of Masonry 5 @,@ 793 . " 
 Washington , accompanied by three Worshipful Masters carrying sacrifices of corn , wine , and oil , then struck the stone three times with a gavel , as prescribed by Masonic custom . Washington exited the trench to ritual chanting by the assembled Masons and a 15 @-@ gun salute ( one gun for each U.S. state ) from the Alexandria Volunteer Artillery . Clark then delivered a short invocation , after which a 500 pounds ( 230 kg ) ox was slaughtered and roasted .

 The apron and sash worn by Washington during the cornerstone laying were , according to popular belief , embroidered several years earlier by the Marquise de La Fayette and gifted to Washington . Contemporary research indicates this may not be the case . The apron is currently owned by the Masonic Grand Lodge of Pennsylvania . 
 The trowel used by Washington during the ceremony is on display at the United States Capitol Visitor Center . Since the cornerstone laying , it has occasionally been used in other Masonic cornerstone ceremonies for important buildings in the Washington metropolitan area , including the Herbert Hoover Building , the chancery of the British embassy , the Thomas Jefferson Memorial , the Washington Monument , and the National Cathedral . 
 The gavel used to ceremonially strike the cornerstone three times was given by Washington to Valentine <unk> , the Worshipful Master of Lodge 9 of Maryland . After <unk> 's death in 1817 , the gavel was donated to the lodge by his family . The lodge kept the gavel at its meeting place until 1922 when it was placed in the vault of Riggs National Bank , now a branch of PNC Bank , where it remains today . It has occasionally been removed for important Masonic cornerstone ceremonies , including that of the National Cathedral and the Washington Monument . 
 The precise location of the cornerstone was lost during the two centuries following the ceremony due to attack and multiple expansions of the original building . In 1993 , Architect of the Capitol George White , following a protracted search involving the use of ground @-@ penetrating radar , electromagnetic induction and induced polarization , announced he had found a large stone buried beneath one section of the foundation that was " obviously a ceremonial stone , " and declared it was probably the cornerstone of the building . No sign of the original silver plaque was discovered , and experts believe it may have been dislodged and destroyed during the 1850 construction of the Senate chambers .

 A centennial rededication of the Capitol , roughly modeled after the cornerstone ceremony of 1793 , was organized on September 18 , 1893 . The pre @-@ ceremonial parade proceeded along the same route followed by Washington 's entourage in 1793 and was led by President Grover Cleveland , who rode in the presidential state coach accompanied by a squadron of United States Army cavalry . The president was followed by a ceremonial escort formed into four divisions . The first division consisted of delegations from Masonic lodges and friendly societies . The second division was formed of contingents from lineage societies , including the Society of the Cincinnati , the Sons of the Revolution , and the Aztec Club of 1847 . The third division included federal military forces , including units from the U.S. Army 3rd Field Artillery Regiment and the District of Columbia National Guard . The fourth division consisted of local fire brigades . At the capitol , the United States Marine Band provided music , accompanied by a 1 @,@ 500 @-@ person choir . Opening remarks were delivered by Cleveland , followed by a two @-@ hour speech by William Wirt Henry , a member of the Virginia House of Delegates and Patrick Henry 's grandson . According to news reports of the day , 150 @,@ 000 spectators attended the event . 
 A more modest bicentennial rededication occurred on September 18 , 1993 , organized by Architect of the Capitol George White . ( After his appointment as Architect of the Capitol , White had been made a Mason @-@ at @-@ Sight , a rarely used mode of initiation in which a Grand Master instantly raises a non @-@ Mason to the degree of Master Mason . ) The 1993 ceremony was attended by the Grand Masters of each of the 50 grand lodges in the United States . At the time , White announced a tricentennial observance to occur on Friday , September 18 , 2093 .

 Congestion pricing or congestion charges is a system of <unk> users of public goods that are subject to congestion through excess demand such as higher peak charges for use of bus services , electricity , metros , railways , telephones , and road pricing to reduce traffic congestion ; airlines and shipping companies may be charged higher fees for slots at airports and through canals at busy times . This pricing strategy regulates demand , making it possible to manage congestion without increasing supply . Market economics theory , which encompasses the congestion pricing concept , postulates that users will be forced to pay for the negative externalities they create , making them conscious of the costs they impose upon each other when consuming during the peak demand , and more aware of their impact on the environment . 
 The application on urban roads is currently limited to a few cities , including London , Stockholm , Singapore , Milan , and Gothenburg , as well as a few smaller towns , such as Durham , England ; <unk> , Czech Republic ; Riga ( the scheme ended in 2008 ) , Latvia ; and Valletta , Malta . Four general types of systems are in use ; a cordon area around a city center , with charges for passing the cordon line ; area wide congestion pricing , which charges for being inside an area ; a city center toll ring , with toll collection surrounding the city ; and corridor or single facility congestion pricing , where access to a lane or a facility is priced . 
 Implementation of congestion pricing has reduced congestion in urban areas , but has also sparked criticism and public discontent . Critics maintain that congestion pricing is not equitable , places an economic burden on neighboring communities , has a negative effect on retail businesses and on economic activity in general , and represents another tax levy . 
 A survey of economic literature on the subject , however , finds that most economists agree that some form of road pricing to reduce congestion is economically viable , although there is disagreement on what form road pricing should take . Economists disagree over how to set tolls , how to cover common costs , what to do with any excess revenues , whether and how " losers " from tolling previously free roads should be compensated , and whether to privatize highways . Also , concerns regarding fossil fuel supply and urban transport high emissions of greenhouse gases in the context of climate change have renewed interest in congestion pricing , as it is considered one of the demand @-@ side mechanisms that may reduce oil consumption . 
 = = Description = = 
 Congestion pricing is a concept from market economics regarding the use of pricing mechanisms to charge the users of public goods for the negative externalities generated by the peak demand in excess of available supply . Its economic rationale is that , at a price of zero , demand exceeds supply , causing a shortage , and that the shortage should be corrected by charging the equilibrium price rather than shifting it down by increasing the supply . Usually this means increasing prices during certain periods of time or at the places where congestion occurs ; or introducing a new usage tax or charge when peak demand exceeds available supply in the case of a tax @-@ funded public good provided free at the point of usage . 
 According to the economic theory behind congestion pricing , the objective of this policy is the use of the price mechanism to make users more aware of the costs that they impose upon one another when consuming during the peak demand , and that they should pay for the additional congestion they create , thus encouraging the redistribution of the demand in space or in time , or shifting it to the consumption of a substitute public good ; for example , switching from private transport to public transport . 
 This pricing mechanism has been used in several public utilities and public services for setting higher prices during congested periods , as a means to better manage the demand for the service , and whether to avoid expensive new investments just to satisfy peak demand , or because it is not economically or financially feasible to provide additional capacity to the service . Congestion pricing has been widely used by telephone and electric utilities , metros , railways and <unk> services , and has been proposed for charging internet access . It also has been extensively studied and advocated by mainstream transport economists for ports , waterways , airports and road pricing , though actual implementation is rather limited due to the controversial issues subject to debate regarding this policy , particularly for urban roads , such as undesirable distribution effects , the disposition of the revenues raised , and the social and political acceptability of the congestion charge . 
 Congestion pricing is one of a number of alternative demand side ( as opposed to supply side ) strategies offered by economists to address traffic congestion . Congestion is considered a negative externality by economists . An externality occurs when a transaction causes costs or benefits to a third party , often , although not necessarily , from the use of a public good : for example , if manufacturing or transportation cause air pollution imposing costs on others when making use of public air . Congestion pricing is an efficiency pricing strategy that requires the users to pay more for that public good , thus increasing the welfare gain or net benefit for society . 
 Nobel @-@ laureate William Vickrey is considered by some to be the father of congestion pricing , as he first proposed it for the New York City Subway system in 1952 . In the road transportation arena these theories were extended by Maurice Allais , Gabriel Roth who was instrumental in the first designs and upon whose World Bank recommendation the first system was put in place in Singapore . Also , it was considered by the <unk> Report , published by the British Ministry of Transport in 1964 , but its recommendations were rejected by successive British governments . 
 The transport economics rationale for implementing congestion pricing on roads , described as " one policy response to the problem of congestion " , was summarized in testimony to the United States Congress Joint Economic Committee in 2003 : " congestion is considered to arise from the <unk> of a good ; namely , highway capacity at a specific place and time . The quantity supplied ( measured in lane @-@ miles ) is less than the quantity demanded at what is essentially a price of zero . If a good or service is provided free of charge , people tend to demand more of it — and use it more <unk> — than they would if they had to pay a price that reflected its cost . Hence , congestion pricing is premised on a basic economic concept : charge a price in order to allocate a scarce resource to its most valuable use , as evidenced by users ' willingness to pay for the resource " . 
 = = Urban roads = = 
 For the broader concept on roads charges see road pricing . 
 Practical implementations of road congestion pricing are found almost exclusively in urban areas , because traffic congestion is common in and around city centers . Autoroute A1 in Northern France is one of the few cases of congestion pricing implemented outside of urban areas . This is an expressway connecting Paris to Lille , and since 1992 congestion prices have been applied during weekends with the objective of spreading demand on the trip back to Paris on Sunday afternoons and evenings . As congestion pricing has been increasing worldwide , the schemes implemented have been classified into four different types : cordon area around a city center ; area wide congestion pricing ; city center toll ring ; and corridor or single facility congestion pricing . 
 = = = Cordon area and area wide = = = 
 Cordon area congestion pricing is a fee or tax paid by users to enter a restricted area , usually within a city center , as part of a demand management strategy to relieve traffic congestion within that area . The economic rationale for this pricing scheme is based on the externalities or social costs of road transport , such as air pollution , noise , traffic accidents , environmental and urban deterioration , and the extra costs and delays imposed by traffic congestion upon other drivers when additional users enter a congested road . 
 The first implementation of such a scheme was Singapore Area Licensing Scheme in 1975 , together with a comprehensive package of road pricing measures , stringent car ownership rules and improvements in mass transit . Thanks to technological advances in electronic toll collection , electronic detection , and video surveillance technology , collecting congestion fees has become easier . Singapore upgraded its system in 1998 , and similar pricing schemes were implemented in Rome in 2001 , London in 2003 with extensions in 2007 ; Stockholm in 2006 , as a seven @-@ month trial , and then on a permanent basis . In January 2008 Milan began a one @-@ year trial program called Ecopass , charging low emission standard vehicles and exempting cleaner and alternative fuel vehicles . The Ecopass program was extended until December 31 , 2011 , and on January 16 , 2012 was replaced by Area C , a trial program that converted the scheme from a pollution @-@ charge to a congestion charge . The Gothenburg congestion tax was implemented in January 2013 and it was modeled after the Stockholm scheme . 
 Although there has not yet been a comprehensive study , initial reports from the cities that have implemented congestion pricing schemes show traffic volume reductions from 10 % to 30 % , as well as reduced air pollution . Also , all cities report public controversy before and after implementation , making political feasibility a critical issue . 
 Singapore and Stockholm charge a congestion fee every time a user crosses the cordon area , while London charges a daily fee for any vehicle driving in a public road within the congestion charge zone , regardless of how many times the user crosses the cordon . Stockholm has put a cap on the maximum daily tax , while in Singapore the charge is based on a pay @-@ as @-@ you @-@ use principle , and rates are set based on traffic conditions at the pricing points , and reviewed on a quarterly basis . Through this policy , the Land Transport Authority ( LTA ) reports that the electronic road pricing " has been effective in maintaining an optimal speed range of 45 to 65 km / h for expressways and 20 to 30 km / h for arterial roads " .

 In an effort to improve the pricing mechanism , and , to introduce real @-@ time variable pricing , Singapore 's LTA together with IBM , ran a pilot from December 2006 to April 2007 , with a traffic estimation and prediction tool ( <unk> ) , which uses historical traffic data and real @-@ time feeds with flow conditions from several sources , in order to predict the levels of congestion up to an hour in advance . By accurately estimating prevailing and emerging traffic conditions , this technology is expected to allow variable pricing , together with improved overall traffic management , including the provision of information in advance to alert drivers about conditions ahead , and the prices being charged at that moment . 
 In 2010 the Land Transport Authority began exploring the potential of Global Navigation Satellite System as a technological option for a second generation ERP . LTA objective is to evaluate if the latest technologies available in the market today are accurate and effective enough for use as a congestion charging tool , especially taking into consideration the dense urban environment in Singapore . Implementation of such system is not expected in the short term .

 A proposal by former Mayor of London Ken Livingstone would have resulted in a new pricing structure based on potential CO2 emission rates by October 2008 . The goal was that vehicles with the very lowest CO2 emission rates would be exempted , and those with higher emission rates would pay a new higher charge of GB £ 25 , with the rest paying the same charge they pay today . However , the current Mayor of London , Boris Johnson , announced at the beginning of his administration that he would reform the congestion charge . 
 Johnson announced in July 2008 that the new CO2 charging structure will no longer be implemented . Among other reasons , he said the environmental charge would encourage travel by thousands of smaller vehicles free of charge , resulting in increase congestion and pollution . He also discarded plans for extending the charge zone to the suburbs , and announced he will review the western extension implemented in 2007 , based on a public consultation planned for September 2008 . Having held a five @-@ week public consultation with residents in the autumn of 2008 , Johnson decided to remove the 2007 Western Extension from the congestion charging zone beginning on January 4 , 2011 , to increase the basic charge to GB £ 10 , and also to introduce an automated payment system called Congestion Charging Auto Pay ( CC Auto Pay ) , which will charge vehicles based on the number of charging days a vehicle travels within the charging zone each month , and the drivers of these vehicles will pay a reduced GB £ 9 daily charge . 
 In November 2012 Transport for London ( TfL ) presented a proposal to abolish the Greener Vehicle Discount that benefited , among others , vehicles with small diesel engines that avoid the charge because their engines produce emissions of less than 100g per km of CO2 . Approved by Mayor Boris Johnson in April 2013 , the Ultra Low Emission Discount ( <unk> ) went into effect on 1 July 2013 . The <unk> introduced more stringent emission standards that limit the free access to the congestion charge zone to all @-@ electric cars , some plug @-@ in hybrids , and any car or van that emits 75g / km or less of CO2 and meets the Euro 5 emission standards for air quality . The measure was designed to curb the growing number of diesel vehicles on London 's roads . About 20 @,@ 000 owners of vehicles registered for the Greener Vehicle Discount by June 2013 were granted a three @-@ year sunset period before they have to pay the full congestion charge . The sunset period ended on 24 June 2016 . 
 Since the congestion charge introduction in 2003 , over GB £ 1 @.@ 2 billion has been invested in transport through December 2013 , including GB £ 960 million on improvements to the bus network ; GB £ 102 million on roads and bridges ; GB £ 70 million on road safety ; GB £ 51 million on local transport / borough plans ; and GB £ 36 million on sustainable transport and the environment . There has been criticism because during the first ten years since the scheme was implemented , gross revenue reached about GB £ 2 @.@ 6 billion , but only GB £ 1 @.@ 2 billion has been invested , meaning that 54 % of gross revenues have been spent in operating the system and administrative expenses . 
 In June 2014 the standard charge was raised 15 % from £ 10 per day to £ 11 @.@ 50 . According to TfL the objective of the increase is to recoup inflation over the previous three years and ensure the charge remains an effective deterrent to making unnecessary journeys in central London .

 The Ecopass pollution charge ended on December 31 , 2011 , and was replaced by the Area C scheme , which went into effect on January 16 , 2012 , initially as an 18 @-@ month pilot program . The Area C scheme is a conventional congestion pricing scheme and is based on the same Ecopass geographic area . Vehicles entering the charging zone incur a charge of € 5 regardless of their pollution level . However , residents inside the area have 40 free entries per year and then a discounted charge of € 2 . Electric vehicles , public utility vehicles , police and emergency vehicles , buses and taxis are exempted from the charge . Hybrid electric and bi @-@ fuel natural gas vehicles ( CNG and LPG ) were exempted until January 1 , 2013 . Exemption has been postponed until December 31 , 2016 . 
 The scheme was made permanent in March 2013 . All net earnings from Area C are invested to promote sustainable mobility and policies to reduce air pollution , including the redevelopment , protection and development of public transport , " soft mobility " ( pedestrians , cycling , Zone 30 ) and systems to rationalize the distribution of goods .

 On 1 January 2016 , congestion taxes were increased in the inner @-@ city parts of Stockholm , and also the congestion tax was introduced on Essingeleden motorway . This was the first increase of the tax since it was introduced permanently in 2007 . 
 The congestion tax is being introduced at the access and exit ramps of two interchanges on Essingeleden in order to reduce traffic jams in peak periods , and with shorter traffic jams on Essingeleden , the surrounding roads are expected to have shorter tailbacks . The transport agencies involved expected to reduce traffic on Essingeleden by some 10 % in peak hours . One week after the tax began to be charged , traffic on the motorway had decreased by 22 % compared to a normal day in mid @-@ December . 
 The tax increase was implemented not only to improve accessibility and the environment , but also to help develop the infrastructure . The additional funds will contribute to finance the extension of the Stockholm metro . As the Stockholm congestion tax varies by time of the day , the highest increase took place at the two busiest rush hour periods , 7 : 30 to 8 : 29 , and 16 : 00 to 17 : 29 , from SEK 20 to SEK 30 . The objective was to steer the traffic towards other times of the day and public transport , and in this way reduce congestion in the Inner City area . Also the maximum amount levied was raised to SEK 105 per day and vehicle .

 Around Europe several relatively small cities , such as Durham , England ; <unk> , Czech Republic ; Riga , Latvia ; and Valletta , Malta , have implemented congestion pricing to reduce traffic crowding , parking problems and pollution , particularly during the peak tourism season . 
 Durham introduced charges in October 2002 , reducing vehicle traffic by 85 % after a year ; prior to this 3 @,@ 000 daily vehicles had shared the streets with 17 @,@ 000 pedestrians . 
 Valletta has reduced daily vehicles entering the city from 10 @,@ 000 to 7 @,@ 900 ; making 400 readily available parking places in the center . There has been a 60 % drop in car stays by non @-@ residents of more than eight hours , but there has been a marked increase of 34 % in non @-@ residential cars visiting the city for an hour or less .

 Hong Kong conducted a pilot test on an electronic congestion pricing system between 1983 and 1985 with positive results . However , public opposition against this policy stalled its permanent implementation . 
 In 2002 Edinburgh , United Kingdom , initiated an implementation process ; a referendum was conducted in 2005 , with a majority of 74 @.@ 4 % rejecting the proposal . 
 Councils from across the West Midlands in the United Kingdom , including Birmingham and Coventry , rejected the idea of imposing congestion pricing schemes on the area in 2008 , despite promises from central government of transport project funding in exchange for the implementation of a road pricing pilot scheme . 
 In 2007 , New York City shelved a proposal for a three @-@ year pilot program for implementation in Manhattan , and a new proposition was denied in 2008 , with potential federal grants of US $ 354 million being reallocated to other American cities . 
 Greater Manchester , United Kingdom , was considering a scheme with two cordons , one covering the main urban core of the Greater Manchester Urban Area and another covering the Manchester city centre . The measure was supported by the government , but three local authorities rejected it ( Bury , Trafford and Stockport ) ; the support of two @-@ thirds of Manchester 's 10 local councils was needed for it to be implemented . A comprehensive transport investment package for Manchester , which included the congestion pricing element , was released for further public consultation and was to be subject of a referendum in December 2008 . On 12 December 2008 the scheme was overwhelmingly rejected by 10 out of 10 councils by a public referendum .

 In August 2007 , the United States Department of Transportation selected five metropolitan areas to initiate congestion pricing demonstration projects under the Urban Partnerships Congestion Initiative , for US $ 1 billion of federal funding . The five projects under this initiative are ; Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco , State Route 520 serving downtown Seattle and communities to its east , Interstate 95 between Miami and Ft . Lauderdale , Interstate 35W serving downtown Minneapolis , and a variable rate parking meter system in Chicago , which replaced New York City after it left the program in 2008 . 
 San Francisco transport authorities began a feasibility study in 2006 to evaluate the introduction of congestion pricing . The charge would be combined with other traffic reduction implementations , allowing money to be raised for public transit improvements and bike and pedestrian enhancements . The initial pricing scenarios were presented in public meetings conducted in December 2008 , and the final study results were announced in November 2010 , proposing modified alternatives based on the public 's feedbacks , and the updated proposal calls for implementing a six @-@ month to one @-@ year trial in 2015 .

 In September 2011 , local officials announced plans to introduce congestion pricing in Beijing . No details were provided regarding the magnitude of the congestion charges or the charge zone . The measure was initially proposed in 2010 and was recommended by the World Bank . A similar scheme was proposed for the city Guangzhou , Guangdong province , in early 2010 . The city opened a public discussion on whether to introduce congestion charges . An online survey conducted by two local news outlets found that 84 @.@ 4 % of respondents opposed the charges . 
 In December 2015 , the Beijing Municipal Commission of Transport announced plans to introduce congestion charges in 2016 . According to city ’ s motor vehicle emission control plan 2013 @-@ 2017 , the congestion charge will be a real @-@ time variable pricing scheme based on actual traffic flows and emissions data , and allow the fee to be charged for different vehicles and varying by time of the day and for different districts . The Dongcheng and Xicheng are among the districts that are most likely to firstly implement congestion charge . Vehicle emissions account for 31 % of the city 's smog sources , according to Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau . The local government has implemented already several policies to address air quality and congestion , such as a driving restriction scheme based upon the last digits on their license plates . Also a vehicle quota system was introduced in 2011 , awarding new car licenses through a lottery , with a ceiling of 6 million units set by the city authority for 2017 . In May 2016 , the Beijing city legislature announced it will consider to start levying traffic congestion charges by 2020 as part of a package of measures to reform the vehicle quota system . As of June 2016 , the city 's environmental and transport departments are working together on a congestion pricing proposal .

 In January 2012 , the federal government of Brazil enacted the Urban Mobility Law that authorizes municipalities to implement congestion pricing to reduce traffic flows . The law also seeks to encourage the use of public transportation and reduce air pollution . According to the law , revenues from congestion charges should be destined exclusively to urban infrastructure for public transportation and non @-@ motorized modes of locomotion ( such as walking and cycling ) , and to finance public subsidies to transit fares . The law went into effect in April 2013 . 
 In April 2012 , one of the committees of the São Paulo city council approved a bill to introduce congestion pricing within the same area as the existing road space rationing ( Portuguese : <unk> <unk> ) by the last digit of the license plate , which has been in force 1996 . The proposed charge is R $ 4 ( ~ US $ 2 ) per day and it is expected to reduce traffic by 30 % and raise about R $ 2 @.@ 5 billion ( ~ US $ 1 @.@ 25 billion ) per year , most of which will be destined to the expansion of the São Paulo Metro system and bus corridors . The bill still needs approval by two other committees before going for a final vote at the city council . Since 1995 , 11 bills have been presented in the city council to introduce congestion pricing . Opinion surveys have shown that the initiative is highly <unk> . A survey by Veja magazine found that 80 % of drivers are against congestion pricing , and another survey by <unk> magazine found that only 1 % of São Paulo 's residents support the initiative , while 30 % find that extending the metro system is a better solution to reduce traffic congestion . São Paulo 's strategic urban development plan " SP 2040 " , approved in November 2012 , proposes the implementation of congestion pricing by 2025 , when the density of metro and bus corridors is expected to reach 1 @.@ 25 km / km2 . The Plan also requires ample consultation and even a referendum before beginning implementation .

 Congestion pricing has also been implemented in urban freeways . Between 2004 and 2005 , Santiago de Chile implemented the first 100 % non @-@ stop urban toll for a freeway passing through a downtown area , charging by the distance traveled . Congestion pricing has been used since 2007 during rush hours in order to maintain reasonable speeds within the city core . 
 Norway pioneered the implementation of electronic urban tolling in the main corridors of Norway 's three major cities : Bergen ( 1986 ) , Oslo ( 1990 ) , and Trondheim ( 1991 ) . In Bergen cars can only enter the central area using a toll road , so that the effect is similar to a congestion charge . Though initially intended only to raise revenues to finance road infrastructure , the urban toll ring at Oslo created an unintended congestion pricing effect , as traffic decreased by around 5 % . The Trondheim Toll Scheme also has congestion pricing effects , as charges vary by time of day . The Norwegian authorities pursued authorization to implement congestion charges in cities , and legislation was approved by Parliament in 2001 . In October 2011 the Norwegian government announced the introduction of rules allowing congestion charging in cities . The measure is intended to cut greenhouse gas and air pollutant emissions , and relief traffic congestion . As of November 2015 , Norwegian authorities have implemented urban charging schemes that operates both on the motorways and for access into downtown areas in five additional cities or municipalities : Haugesund , Kristiansand , Namsos , Stavanger , and <unk> .

 Other recent application of congestion pricing policies in the urban transportation context is to adopt an innovative tolling for a particular limited purpose . The first of this kind of specific schemes allowed users of low or single @-@ occupancy vehicles to use a high @-@ occupancy vehicle lanes ( HOV ) if they pay a toll . This scheme is known as high @-@ occupancy toll lanes ( HOT ) lanes , and it has been introduced mainly in the United States and Canada . The first practical implementations was California 's private toll 91 Express Lanes , in Orange County in 1995 , followed in 1996 by Interstate 15 in San Diego . There has been controversy over this concept , and HOT schemes have been called " Lexus " lanes , as critics see this new pricing scheme as a perk to the rich . According to the Texas A & M Transportation Institute , by 2012 there were in the United States 722 corridor @-@ miles of HOV lanes , 294 corridor @-@ miles of HOT / Express lanes and 163 corridor @-@ miles of HOT / Express lanes under construction . 
 Congestion pricing in the form of variable tolls by time @-@ of @-@ the @-@ day have also been implemented in bridges and tunnels providing access to the central business districts of several major cities . In most cases there was a toll already in existence . 
 In March 2001 , the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey implemented a discount on regular toll fees during off @-@ peak hours for those vehicles paying electronically with an EZ Pass issued in New York State . These discount toll was implemented at several tunnels and bridges connecting New York City and New Jersey , including the George Washington Bridge , Lincoln Tunnel , and Holland Tunnel , and at some other bridges administrated by PANYNJ . Since March 2008 , qualified low @-@ emission automobiles with a fuel economy of at least 45 miles per gallon are eligible to receive a Port Authority Green Pass , which allows for a 50 % discount during off @-@ peak hours as compared to the regular full toll . 
 In January 2009 , variable tolls were implemented at Sydney Harbour Bridge , two weeks after upgrading to 100 % free @-@ flow electronic toll collection . The highest fees are charged during the morning and afternoon peak periods ; a toll 25 % lower applies for the shoulder periods ; and a toll lower than the previously existing is charged at nights , weekends , and public holidays . This is Australia 's first road congestion pricing scheme , and has had only a very minor effect on traffic levels , reducing them by 0 @.@ 19 % 
 In July 2010 congestion tolls were implemented at the San Francisco @-@ Oakland Bay Bridge . The Bay Bridge congestion pricing scheme charges a US $ 6 toll from 5 a.m. to 10 a.m. and 3 p.m. to 7 p.m. , Monday through Friday . During weekends cars pay US $ 5 . The toll remained at the previous toll of US $ 4 at all other times on weekdays . According to the Bay Area Toll Authority fewer users are driving during the peak hours and more vehicles are crossing the Bay Bridge before and after the 5 – 10 a.m. period in which the congestion toll goes into effect . The agency also reported that commute delays in the first six months have dropped by an average of 15 percent compared with 2009 . When the congestion tolls were proposed , the agency expected the scheme to produce a 20 to 30 percent drop in commute traffic .

 Both in the academic literature and in practice , the implementation of congestion pricing for urban road travel has raised several concerns , and has been subject of debate and controversy . 
 = = = = Measurement of effects = = = = 
 In a road network , congestion can be considered a specific measure of the time delay in a journey or time lost through traffic jams . Delays can be caused by some combination of traffic density , road capacity , and the delaying effects of other road users and traffic management schemes such as traffic lights , junctions , and street works . This can be measured as the extra journey time needed to traverse a congested route when compared to the same route with no such interference . However , this technical definition of congestion as a measurement of delay can get confused and used interchangeably with traffic density in the public mind . 
 To measure the true effects of any traffic management scheme it is normally necessary to establish a baseline , or " do nothing " case , which estimates the effects on the network without any changes other than normal trends and expected local changes . Notably this was not done for the London Congestion Charging Scheme , which has led to claims that it is not possible to determine the extent of the actual influence of the scheme . Regardless of the scheme 's impact , in a retrospective analysis Transport for London ( TfL ) estimated there would have already been a significant reduction in traffic as a consequence of parking policies and increased congestion due to traffic management and other interventions that had the effect of reducing highway capacity . In 2006 , the last year before the zone was expanded , TfL observed that traffic flows were lower than in any recent year , while network traffic speeds were also lower than in any recent year . 
 In 2013 , ten years since its implementation , TfL reported that the congestion charging scheme resulted in a 10 % reduction in traffic volumes from baseline conditions , and an overall reduction of 11 % in vehicle kilometres in London between 2000 and 2012 . Despite these gains , traffic speeds have also been getting progressively slower over the past decade , particularly in central London . TfL explains that the historic decline in traffic speeds is most likely due to interventions that have reduced the effective capacity of the road network in order to improve the urban environment , increase road safety and prioritise public transport , pedestrian and cycle traffic , as well as an increase in road works by utilities and general development activity since 2006 . TfL concludes that while levels of congestion in central London are close to pre @-@ charging levels , the effectiveness of the congestion charge in reducing traffic volumes means that conditions would be worse without the Congestion Charging scheme . 
 = = = = Academic debate and concerns = = = = 
 Even the transport economists who advocate congestion pricing have anticipated several practical limitations , concerns and controversial issues regarding the actual implementation of this policy . As summarized by <unk> : 
 " True social @-@ cost pricing of metropolitan travel has proven to be a theoretical ideal that so far has eluded real @-@ world implementation . The primary obstacle is that except for professors of transportation economics and a cadre of vocal environmentalists , few people are in favor of considerably higher charges for peak @-@ period travel . Middle @-@ class motorists often complain they already pay too much in gasoline taxes and registration fees to drive their cars , and that to pay more during congested periods would add insult to injury . In the United States , few politicians are willing to champion the cause of congestion pricing for fear of reprisal from their constituents . Critics also argue that charging more to drive is elitist policy , pricing the poor off of roads so that the wealthy can move about unencumbered . It is for all these reasons that peak @-@ period pricing remains a pipe dream in the minds of many . " 
 Both Button and Small et al . , have identified the following issues : 
 The real @-@ world demand functions for urban road travel are more complex than the theoretical functions used in transport economics analysis . Congestion pricing was developed as a first @-@ best solution , based on the assumption that the optimal price of road space equals the marginal cost price if all other goods in the economy are also marginal cost priced . In the real world this is not true , thus , actual implementation of congestion pricing is just a proxy or second @-@ best solution . Based on the economic principles behind congestion pricing , the optimal congestion charge should make up for the difference between the average cost paid by the driver and the marginal cost imposed on other drivers ( such as extra delay ) and on society as a whole ( such as air pollution ) . The practical challenge of setting optimal link @-@ based tolls is daunting given that neither the demand functions nor the link @-@ specific speed @-@ flow curves can be known precisely . Therefore , transport economists recognize that in practice setting the right price for the congestion charge becomes a trial and error experience . 
 Inequality issue : A main concern is the possibility of undesirable distribution repercussions because of the diversity of road users . The use of the tolled road depends on the user 's level of income . Where some cannot afford to pay the congestion charge , then this policy is likely to privilege the middle @-@ class and rich . The users who shift to some less @-@ preferred alternative are also worse off . The less wealthy are the more likely to switch to public transit . Road space rationing is another strategy generally viewed as more equitable than congestion pricing . However , high @-@ income users can always avoid the travel restrictions by owning a second car and users with relatively inelastic demand ( such as a worker who needs to transport tools to a job site ) are relatively more impacted . 
 There are difficulties in deciding how to allocate the revenues raised . This is a controversial issue among scholars . The revenues can be used to improve public transport ( as is the case in London ) , or to invest in new road infrastructure ( as in Oslo ) . Some academics make the case that revenues should be disposed as a direct transfer payments to former road users . Congestion pricing is not intended to increase public revenues or to become just another tax , however this is precisely one of the main concerns of road users and taxpayers . 
 One alternative , aimed at avoiding inequality and revenue allocation issues , is to implement a rationing of peak period travel through mobility rights or revenue @-@ neutral credit @-@ based congestion pricing . This system would be similar to the existing emissions trading of carbon credit . Metropolitan area or city residents , or the taxpayers , would be issued mobility rights or congestion credits , and would have the option of using these for themselves , or trading or selling them to anyone willing to continue traveling by automobile beyond their personal quota . This trading system would allow direct benefits to be accrued by those users shifting to public transportation or by those reducing their peak @-@ hour travel rather than the government . 
 = = = = Public controversy = = = = 
 Experience from the few cities where congestion pricing has been implemented shows that social and political acceptability is key . Public discontent with congestion pricing , or rejection of congestion pricing proposals , is due mainly to the inequality issues , the economic burden on neighboring communities , the effect on retail businesses and the economic activity in general , and the fears that the revenues will become just another tax . 
 Congestion pricing remains highly controversial with the public both before and after implementation . This has in part been resolved through referendums , such as after the seven @-@ month trial period in Stockholm ; however this creates a debate as to where the border line for the referendum should go , since it is often the people living outside the urban area who have to pay the tax , while the external benefit is granted those who live within the area . In Stockholm there was a majority in the referendum within the city border ( where the votes counted ) , but not outside . 
 Some concerns have also been expressed regarding the effects of cordon area congestion pricing on economic activity and land use , as the benefits are usually evaluated from the urban transportation perspective only . However , congestion pricing schemes have been used with the main objective of improving urban quality and to preserve historical heritage in the small cities . 
 The effects of a charge on business have been disputed ; reports have shops and businesses being heavily impacted by the cost of the charge , both in terms of lost sales and increased delivery costs in London , while others show that businesses were then supporting the charge six months after implementation . Reports show business activity within the charge zone had been higher in both productivity and profitability and that the charge had a " broadly neutral impact " on the London wide economy , while others claim an average drop in business of 25 % following the 2007 extension . 
 Other criticism has been raised concerning the environmental effects on neighborhoods bordering the congestion zone , with critics claiming that congestion pricing would create " parking lots " and add more traffic and pollution to those neighborhoods , and the imposition of a regressive tax on some commuters . Stockholm 's trial of congestion pricing , however , showed a reduction in traffic in areas outside the congestion zone . Other opponents argue that the pricing could become a tax on middle- and lower @-@ class residents , since those citizens would be affected the most financially . The installation of cameras for tracking purposes may also raise civil liberties concerns . 
 = = Waterways = = 
 = = = Panama Canal Transit Booking System and Transit Slot Auction = = = 
 The Panama Canal had a limited capacity determined by operational times and cycles of the existing locks and further constrained by the current trend towards larger ( close to Panamax @-@ sized ) vessels transiting the canal which take more transit time within the locks and navigational channels , and the need for permanent periodical maintenance works due to the aging canal , which forces periodical shutdowns of this waterway . On the other hand , demand has been growing due to the rapid growth of international trade . Also , many users require a guarantee of certain level of service . Despite the gains which have been made in efficiency , the Panama Canal Authority ( ACP ) estimates that the canal will reach its maximum sustainable capacity between 2009 and 2012 . The long @-@ term solution for the congestion problems was the expansion of the canal through a new third set of locks . Work started in 2007 and the expanded canal enter commercial operation in June 2016 . The new locks allow transit of larger , Post @-@ Panamax ships , which have a greater cargo capacity than the current locks are capable of handling . 
 Considering the high operational costs of the vessels ( <unk> have daily operational costs of approximately US $ 40 @,@ 000 ) , the long queues that occur during the high season ( sometimes up to a week 's delay ) , and the high value of some of the cargo transported through the canal , the ACP implemented a congestion pricing scheme to allow a better management of the scarce capacity available and to increase the level of service offered to the shipping companies . The scheme gave users two choices : ( 1 ) transit by order of arrival on a first @-@ come first @-@ served basis , as the canal historically has operated ; or ( 2 ) booked service for a fee — a congestion charge . 
 The booked service allowed two options of fees . The Transit Booking System , available online , allowing customers who do not want to wait in queue to pay an additional 15 % over the regular tolls , guaranteeing a specific day for transit and crossing the canal in 18 hours or less . ACP sells 24 of these daily slots up to 365 days in advance . The second choice was high priority transit . Since 2006 , ACP has available a 25th slot , sold through the Transit Slot Auction to the highest bidder . The main customers of the Transit Booking System are cruise ships , <unk> , vehicle carriers , and non @-@ containerized cargo vessels . 
 The highest toll for high priority passage paid through the Transit Slot Auction was US $ 220 @,@ 300 charged on a tanker in August 2006 , bypassing a 90 @-@ ship queue awaiting for the end of maintenance works on the Gatun locks , thus avoiding a seven @-@ day delay . The normal fee would have been just US $ 13 @,@ 430 . The average regular toll is around US $ 54 @,@ 000 . 
 = = Airports = = 
 Many airports are facing extreme congestion , runway capacity being the <unk> resource . Congestion pricing schemes have been proposed to mitigate this problem , including slot auctions , such as with the Panama Canal , but implementation has been piecemeal . The first scheme was started in 1968 when higher landing fees for peak @-@ hour use by aircraft with 25 seats or less at Newark , Kennedy , and LaGuardia airports in New York City . As a result of the higher charges , general aviation activity during peak periods decreased by 30 % . These fees were applied until deregulation of the industry , but higher fees for general aviation were kept to discourage this type of operations at New York 's busiest airports . In 1988 a higher landing fee for smaller aircraft at Boston 's Logan Airport was adopted ; with this measure much of the general aviation abandoned Logan for secondary airports . In both US cases the pricing scheme was challenged in court . In the case of Boston , the judge ruled in favor of general aviation users due to lack of alternative airports . In the case of New York , the judge dismissed the case because " the fee was a justified means of relieving congestion " . 
 Congestion pricing has also been implemented for scheduled airline services . The British Airports Authority ( BAA ) has been a pioneer in implementing congestion pricing for all types of commercial aviation . In 1972 implemented the first peak pricing policy , with surcharges varying depending on the season and time of the day , and by 1976 raised these peak charges . London @-@ Heathrow had seven pricing structures between 1976 and 1984 . In this case it was the US carriers that went to international arbitration in 1988 and won their case . 
 In 1991 , the Athens Airport charged a 25 % higher landing fee for those aircraft arriving between 11 : 00 and 17 : 00 during the high tourism season during summer . Hong Kong charges an additional flat fee to the basic weight charge . In 1991 – 92 peak pricing at London 's main airports Heathrow , Gatwick and Stansted was implemented ; airlines were charged different landing fees for peak and off @-@ peak operations depending on the weight of aircraft . For example , in the case of a Boeing 757 , the peak landing fee was about 2 @.@ 5 times higher than the off @-@ peak fee in all three airports . For a Boeing 747 the differential was even higher , as the old 747 carries a higher noise charge . Though related to runway congestion , the main objective of these peak charges at the major British airports was to raise revenue for investment . 
 = Opabinia = 
 Opabinia regalis is an extinct , stem group arthropod found in the Middle Cambrian Burgess Shale Lagerstätte of British Columbia , Canada . Fewer than twenty good specimens have been described ; 3 specimens of Opabinia are known from the Greater Phyllopod bed , where they comprise less than 0 @.@ 1 % of the community . Opabinia was a soft @-@ bodied animal of modest size , and its segmented body had lobes along the sides and a fan @-@ shaped tail . The head shows unusual features : five eyes , a mouth under the head and facing backwards , and a proboscis that probably passed food to the mouth . Opabinia probably lived on the seafloor , using the proboscis to seek out small , soft food . 
 When the first thorough examination of Opabinia in 1975 revealed its unusual features , it was thought to be unrelated to any known phylum , although possibly related to a hypothetical ancestor of arthropods and of annelid worms . However other finds , most notably Anomalocaris , suggested that it belonged to a group of animals that were closely related to the ancestors of arthropods and of which the living animals onychophorans and tardigrades may also be members . 
 In the 1970s there was an ongoing debate about whether multi @-@ celled animals appeared suddenly during the Early Cambrian , in an event called the Cambrian explosion , or had arisen earlier but without leaving fossils . At first Opabinia was regarded as strong evidence for the " explosive " hypothesis . Later the discovery of a whole series of similar lobopod animals , some with closer resemblances to arthropods , and the development of the idea of stem groups suggested that the Early Cambrian was a time of relatively fast evolution but one that could be understood without assuming any unique evolutionary processes . 
 = = History of discovery = = 
 Charles Doolittle Walcott found in the Burgess Shale nine almost complete fossils of Opabinia regalis and a few of what he classified as Opabinia media , and published a description of all of these in 1912 . The generic name is derived from <unk> pass between Mount <unk> and Mount Biddle , southeast of Lake O 'Hara , British Columbia , Canada . In 1966 – 1967 Harry B. Whittington found another good specimen , and in 1975 he published a detailed description based on very thorough dissection of some specimens and photographs of these specimens lit from a variety of angles . Whittington 's analysis did not cover Opabinia media : Walcott 's specimens of this species could not be identified in his collection . In 1960 Russian paleontologists described specimens they found in the <unk> region of Siberia and labelled Opabinia <unk> , but these fossils were poorly preserved , and Whittington did not feel they provided enough information to be classified as members of the genus Opabinia . 
 = = Occurrence = = 
 All the recognized Opabinia specimens found so far come from the " Phyllopod bed " of the Burgess Shale , in the Canadian Rockies of British Columbia . 
 In 1997 Briggs and <unk> reported from South Australia a new specimen of Myoscolex that was much better preserved than previous specimens , leading them to conclude that it was a close relative of Opabinia — although this interpretation was later questioned by <unk> , who instead concluded that Myoscolex was an annelid worm . 
 = = Description = = 
 Opabinia looked so strange that the audience at the first presentation of Whittington 's analysis laughed . The length of Opabinia regalis from head to tail ranged between 4 centimetres ( 1 @.@ 6 in ) and 7 centimetres ( 2 @.@ 8 in ) . The animal also had a hollow proboscis , whose total length was about one @-@ third of the body 's and projected down from under the head and then curved forwards and upwards . The proboscis was striated like a vacuum cleaner 's hose and probably flexible , and it ended with a claw @-@ like structure whose inner edges bore spines that projected inwards and forwards . The head bore five eyes : two on stalks near the front and fairly close to the middle of the head , pointing upwards and forwards ; two larger eyes , also stalked , near the rear and outer edges of the head , pointing upwards and sideways ; and a single eye with a shorter stalk between the larger pair of stalked eyes , pointing upwards . It has been assumed that the eyes were all compound , like arthropods ' lateral eyes , but this reconstruction , which is not backed up by any evidence , is " somewhat fanciful " . The mouth was under the head , behind the proboscis , and pointed backwards , so that the digestive tract formed a U @-@ bend on its way towards the rear of the animal . The proboscis appeared sufficiently long and flexible to reach the mouth . 
 The main part of the body was typically about 5 millimetres ( 0 @.@ 20 in ) wide and had 15 segments , on each of which there was a pair of lobes ( flaps ) pointing downwards and outwards . The lobes overlapped so that the front of each was covered by the rear edge of the one ahead of it . The body ended with what looked like a single conical segment bearing three pairs of overlapping lobes that pointed up and out , forming a tail like a V @-@ shaped double fan . 
 Interpretations of other features of Opabinia fossils differ . Since the animals did not have mineralized armor nor even tough organic exoskeletons like those of insects , their bodies were flattened as they were buried and fossilized , and smaller or internal features appear as markings within the outlines of the fossils . 
 Whittington interpreted as gills some markings on the upper surfaces of all lobes except the first on each side , and thought that these gills were flat underneath , had overlapping layers on top , and attached to the bases of the lobes . Budd ( 1996 , 2011 ) thought they consisted of separate " blades " attached along the front edges on the undersides of the lobes . He also found marks inside the lobes ' front edges that he interpreted as internal channels connecting the gills to the interior of the body , much as Whittington interpreted the mark along the proboscis as an internal channel . On the other hand , Bergström ( 1986 ) interpreted both the " gills " and the lobes as part of a covering over the upper surface of the body . 
 Whittington found evidence of near @-@ triangular features along the body , and concluded that they were internal structures , most likely sideways extensions of the gut . Chen et al . ( 1994 ) interpreted them as contained within the lobes along the sides . Budd thought the " triangles " were too wide to fit within Opabinia 's slender body , and that cross @-@ section views showed they were attached separately from and lower than the lobes , and extended below the body . He later found specimens that appeared to preserve the legs ' exterior cuticle . He therefore interpreted the " triangles " as short , fleshy , conical legs . He also found small mineralized patches at the tips of some , and interpreted these as claws . Zhang and Briggs ( 2007 ) analyzed the chemical composition of the " triangles " , and concluded that they had the same composition as the gut , and therefore agreed with Whittington that they were part of the digestive system . Instead they regarded Opabinia 's lobe + gill arrangement as an early form of the biramous limbs seen in trilobites and crustaceans and which may be the original form in all arthropods . However , this similar chemical composition is not only associated with the digestive tract ; Budd and Daley suggest that it represents mineralization forming within fluid @-@ filled cavities within the body ( consistent with hollow lobopod legs ) . 
 = = Lifestyle = = 
 The way in which the Burgess Shale animals were buried , by a mudslide or a sediment @-@ laden current that acted as a sandstorm , suggests they lived on the surface of the seafloor . Opabinia probably used its proboscis to search the sediment for food particles and pass them to its mouth . Since there is no sign of anything that might function as jaws , its food was presumably small and soft . Whittington , believing that Opabinia had no legs , thought that it crawled on its lobes and that it could also have swum slowly by flapping the lobes , especially if it timed the movements to create " Mexican waves " . On the other hand , he thought the body was not flexible enough to allow fish @-@ like undulations of the whole body . 
 = = Classification = = 
 Considering how paleontologists ' reconstructions of Opabinia differ , it is not surprising that the animal 's classification is still debated . Walcott , the original describer , considered it to be an <unk> crustacean , while Leif Størmer , following earlier work by Percy Raymond , thought that it belonged to the so @-@ called " <unk> " . After his thorough analysis Whittington concluded that Opabinia was no arthropod , as he found no evidence for <unk> jointed limbs , and nothing like the flexible , probably fluid @-@ filled proboscis was known in arthropods . Although he left Opabinia 's classification above the family level open , the <unk> but not articulated body and the unusual lateral lobes with gills persuaded him that it may have been a representative of the ancestral stock from which both the annelids and arthropods arose . 
 In 1985 Derek Briggs and Whittington published a description of Anomalocaris , also from the Burgess Shale . Swedish palaeontologist Jan Bergström suggested that the two animals were related , as they shared lateral flaps with gills , stalked eyes and other features ; and he classified them as primitive arthropods , although he considered that arthropods are not a single phylum . 
 In 1996 Graham Budd found what he considered evidence of short , un @-@ jointed legs in Opabinia . His examination of the anomalocarid Kerygmachela from the Sirius Passet lagerstätte , about 518 million years ago and over 10M years older than the Burgess Shale , convinced him that this had similar legs . He considered the legs of these two genera very similar to those of the Burgess Shale <unk> and the modern onychophorans , which are regarded as closely related to the ancestors of arthropods . After examining several sets of features shared by these and similar lobopods he drew up a " broad @-@ scale reconstruction of the arthropod stem @-@ group " , in other words of arthropods and what he considered to be their evolutionary " aunts " and " cousins " . One striking feature of this family tree is that modern tardigrades may be Opabinia 's closest living evolutionary relatives . 
 Although Zhang and Briggs ( 2007 ) disagreed with Budd 's diagnosis that Opabinia 's " triangles " were legs , the resemblance they saw between Opabinia 's lobe + gill arrangement and arthropods ' biramous limbs led them to conclude that Opabinia was very closely related to arthropods . In fact they presented a family tree very similar to Budd 's except that theirs did not mention tardigrades . 
 = = Theoretical significance = = 
 Opabinia made it clear how little was known about soft @-@ bodied animals , which do not usually leave fossils . When Whittington described it in the mid @-@ 1970s , there was already a vigorous debate about the early evolution of animals . Preston Cloud argued in 1948 and 1968 that the process was " explosive " , and in the early 1970s Niles Eldredge and Stephen Jay Gould developed their theory of punctuated equilibrium , which views evolution as long intervals of near @-@ stasis " punctuated " by short periods of rapid change . On the other hand , around the same time Wyatt Durham and Martin Glaessner both argued that the animal kingdom had a long Proterozoic history that was hidden by the lack of fossils . Whittington ( 1975 ) concluded that Opabinia , and other taxa such as Marrella and <unk> , cannot be accommodated in modern groups . This was one of the primary reasons why Gould in his book on the Burgess Shale , Wonderful Life , considered that Early Cambrian life was much more diverse and " experimental " than any later set of animals and that the Cambrian explosion was a truly dramatic event , possibly driven by unusual evolutionary mechanisms . He regarded Opabinia as so important to understanding this phenomenon that he wanted to call his book Homage to Opabinia . 
 However , other discoveries and analyses soon followed , revealing similar @-@ looking animals such as Anomalocaris from the Burgess Shale and Kerygmachela from Sirius Passet . Another Burgess Shale animal , <unk> , was considered very similar to modern <unk> , which are regarded as close relatives of arthropods . Paleontologists defined a group called lobopods to include animals that are thought to be close relatives of arthropods but lack jointed limbs . There is still debate about whether lobopods are monophyletic , i.e. whether they include all and only the descendants of a single common ancestor , and about whether arthropods are a sub @-@ group of lobopods or a sister @-@ group . 
 While this discussion about specific fossils such as Opabinia and Anomalocaris was going on , the concept of stem groups was introduced to cover evolutionary " aunts " and " cousins " . A crown group is a group of closely related living animals plus their last common ancestor plus all its descendants . A stem group contains offshoots from members of the lineage earlier than the last common ancestor of the crown group ; it is a relative concept , for example tardigrades are living animals that form a crown group in their own right , but Budd ( 1996 ) regarded them also as being a stem group relative to the arthropods . Viewing strange @-@ looking organisms like Opabinia in this way makes it possible to see that , while the Cambrian explosion was unusual , it can be understood in terms of normal evolutionary processes . 
 = Automonopoli = 
 Automonopoli , also known as Go to Jail , is an unauthorised computer version of the boardgame Monopoly , released in June 1983 by Automata UK for the ZX Spectrum . Although other two @-@ player Monopoly computer programs already existed , the developer advertised that their Automonopoli was the first with an artificial intelligence strong enough to compete against and defeat human players . 
 Initially released under the name Automonopoli , Waddingtons threatened legal action against Automata , and within weeks of its release the game was rebranded as Go to Jail . Waddingtons , concerned about the potential impact on a forthcoming official Monopoly video game , began formal court proceedings against Automata in late 1983 , and the game was withdrawn from sale in early 1984 . 
 = = Initial release = = 
 Automonopoli was released by Automata UK in June 1983 , selling for £ 6 ( £ NaN as of 2016 ) Written primarily in BASIC , it modelled the board game Monopoly in every detail of gameplay . Although other versions of Monopoly for home computers were already in circulation for play between human players , at the time of its release Automonopoli was marketed as the first version of the game with an artificial intelligence advanced enough for the computer to play against human players . 
 Rather than display the entire board , only two full spaces ( and a section of a third ) are displayed at one time during gameplay . The board scrolls from right to left as the player advances following each dice roll , while pressing the " X " key takes the player to a separate screen showing a full list of sites and their current ownership , allowing players to buy and sell properties between themselves , to build houses and hotels , and to mortgage and <unk> properties . On landing on a property the player is offered the chance to buy it ; if the player declines , or they have insufficient funds , the property is put up for auction . The game copies the UK version of the Monopoly board game in every significant detail , including the exact wording of the property names and " chance " cards . 
 Sold almost exclusively by mail order , the game received limited but positive reviews on its release from the few magazines which then covered ZX Spectrum gaming . A short review in ZX Computing at the time of its initial release , praised the " excellent " graphics and the strength of the computer 's gameplay , a theme repeated in a brief review in Crash . The only full @-@ length review , in ZX Computing nine months after the game 's original release , also praised the AI 's gameplay and said that " the only major complaint I can make against the program is its limited use of sound " . 
 = = Legal action and change of name = = 
 Shortly after its release , Waddingtons , UK publishers of the Monopoly boardgame , raised objections to the Automonopoli title , saying that there was a risk purchasers would confuse the two products . Automata changed the name of the product to Go to Jail in their packaging and advertising , claiming in their advertising that despite being identical in every way , Go to Jail was unrelated to Automonopoli . 
 Waddingtons was in talks with Parker Brothers ( the US publisher of Monopoly ) over jointly developing an official Monopoly computer game , and continued to object to perceived infringement by Automata ; Waddingtons spokesman Neville Fishwick said " They are riding on the back of a game we have had for 50 years . They know damn well it 's not their game , it 's ours " . In December 1983 Waddingtons began court proceedings against Automata ; Automata in turn launched a fundraising campaign with the support of the Computer Trade Association , whose secretary Nigel Blackhurst said " The Waddingtons action represents a major threat to the whole computing industry . If they win about 80 per cent of the games software in the market would become <unk> " . 
 In January 1984 , the courts ordered Automata to withdraw the program from sale . In May 1984 Waddingtons announced that the official ZX Spectrum version of Monopoly would be released shortly by Leisure Genius , although Waddingtons would retain the responsibility for taking legal action against the publishers of other computer games based on the board game . The official Monopoly video game was eventually released in July 1985 , and was described by Home Computing Weekly as " vastly superior to the other non @-@ authorised versions " . 
 = Hurricane King = 
 Hurricane King was the most severe hurricane to strike the city of Miami , Florida , since the 1926 Miami hurricane . It was the eleventh tropical storm and the last of six major hurricanes in the 1950 Atlantic hurricane season . The cyclone formed in the western Caribbean Sea on October 13 , and initially moved northeastward , slowly strengthening . Hurricane King crossed Cuba on October 17 , causing seven deaths and $ 2 million in damage ( 1950 USD ) . It reached its peak intensity of 130 mph ( 210 km / h ) and subsequently made landfall on downtown Miami . The hurricane damaged 20 @,@ 861 houses in southern Florida , 580 of them severely , and destroyed a further 248 . Further inland , King caused heavy crop damage , particularly to the citrus industry . After weakening to a tropical storm , King moved across Georgia , where it caused isolated power outages and minor damage . Across the United States , the hurricane left four fatalities and $ 30 million in damage ( $ 316 @,@ 000 @,@ 000 in 2014 USD ) . 
 = = Meteorological history = = 
 The origins of Hurricane King were from a tropical depression that developed just off the north coast of Honduras on October 13 . It was a small system throughout its duration , and initially moved toward the east and east @-@ northeast . At the time , the system was considered a weak and broad depression , producing convection , or thunderstorms , from Honduras to western Cuba . It tracked to the east @-@ northeast , becoming a tropical storm on October 14 . The system was later given the name " King " from the Joint Army / Navy Phonetic Alphabet . 
 The tropical storm slowly intensified as it tracked toward Cuba , and on October 16 , King attained hurricane status while passing between Jamaica and the Cayman Islands . It quickly intensified that day , and at 2200 UTC , the hurricane made landfall just west of Camagüey with winds of 90 mph ( 150 km / h ) . The hurricane remained small , as the city of Camagüey reported peak winds of only 65 mph ( 105 km / h ) . Within twelve hours , Hurricane King crossed central Cuba , during which it weakened into a minimal hurricane . After entering the Florida Straits , King quickly re @-@ intensified , and Hurricane Hunters indicated maximum winds of 100 to 105 mph ( 160 to 165 km / h ) over water . At the time , the barometric pressure was 988 mbar , and the eye was 20 miles ( 32 km ) in diameter . The hurricane quickly intensified as it turned north @-@ northwestward . Early on October 18 , King attained major hurricane status ; it was the sixth and final major hurricane of the season . In 24 hours , the pressure dropped 33 @.@ 2 mbar and the eye contracted to 5 miles ( 8 km ) in diameter . At 0500 UTC on October 18 , Hurricane King made landfall on downtown Miami , Florida with peak winds of 130 mph ( 210 km / h ) , making it a Category 4 hurricane . The city 's Weather Bureau office , which was struck by the eastern eyewall , recorded sustained winds of 122 mph ( 197 km / h ) with gust estimated at 150 mph ( 240 km / h ) . 
 Over land , the compact hurricane weakened as it continued through the state . After crossing Lake Okeechobee , Hurricane King passed over the city of Okeechobee , which recorded a pressure of 977 mbar . The winds diminished along the southern and western side of the storm , although winds gusted to hurricane force in many locations in eastern coastal Florida . Early on October 19 , King weakened to tropical storm status over north @-@ central Florida , and later that day weakened further into a tropical depression over western Georgia . King curved northwestward , dissipating over Alabama on October 20 .

 = = = Caribbean = = = 
 Early in its duration , King produced a widespread area of convection that spread from Honduras to Cuba . Swan Island , located just off of the coast of Honduras , reported 2 @.@ 03 in ( 52 mm ) of rainfall . Prior to its first landfall , officials posted hurricane warnings across eastern Cuba and the Bahamas . While crossing over Cuba , Hurricane King produced winds of up to 120 mph ( 195 km / h ) . The hurricane killed seven people and caused $ 2 million ( 1950 USD ) in damage throughout the country . Offshore , a freighter sunk during the storm , prompting the crew 's rescue by the Cuban navy . There was an initial report of ten people missing on the ship , although it is unknown how many , if any , were related to the seven confirmed deaths in the country . 
 = = = Florida = = = 
 About 36 hours prior to the hurricane making landfall , when it was still south of Cuba , the Miami Weather Bureau issued a hurricane alert for South Florida . About 18 hours before landfall , the alert was replaced by a hurricane warning . The advance warning time was believed to have prevented many deaths ; however , the population was considered complacent with the warning , causing additional damage when they executed improper preparations , such as securing windows . 
 Hurricane King struck Miami around midnight local time with a very compact area of strong winds . Its eye was about 5 @.@ 2 miles ( 8 @.@ 4 km ) in diameter ; the western edge of the eye moved across Miami International Airport , which reported wind gusts of 125 mph ( 202 km / h ) , and the eastern side struck the Miami Weather Bureau office , which recorded sustained winds of 122 mph ( 197 km / h ) . The principal damage zone was sharply @-@ defined in an area 14 miles ( 23 km ) in diameter ; the boundaries of the damage resembled the path of a tornado , although a subsequent analysis indicated the majority of the damage was not tornadic in nature . There was one confirmed report of a damaging tornado in Davie . As it made landfall , Hurricane King produced lightning near its center , which was the first confirmed occurrence in Florida . The Weather Bureau considered King the severest hurricane since the 1926 Great Miami Hurricane to hit the area . 
 Across Florida , damage totaled $ 27 @.@ 75 million ( 1950 USD ) , of which $ 15 million was in the Miami metropolitan area . The hurricane damaged 20 @,@ 861 houses in southern Florida , 580 of them severely . Additionally , 248 trailer homes were damaged , 188 of them severely . A total of 248 houses or trailers were destroyed in the Miami area . A preliminary survey indicated there were about 2 @,@ 000 store windows that were broken during the storm . In West Hollywood , a town of 2 @,@ 000 people located north of Miami , strong winds destroyed or severely damaged about 150 houses , leaving hundreds homeless . At the Broward County airport in Fort Lauderdale , the winds damaged 55 buildings and destroyed one plane . Further north , damage was lighter in Palm Beach , consisting of downed trees and flooded streets . Along its path through the state , strong winds were observed around Lake Okeechobee , with a 93 mph ( 150 km / h ) gust in Clewiston . In Orlando , the winds destroyed the roof of an airport hangar . 
 In central Florida , the hurricane caused widespread damage to crops and properties . Damage to the grapefruit crop was heaviest in the region along the Indian River , where losses were expected to reach 30 % . The orange crop was not as affected , and no area reported total losses at more than 5 % . Losses to the citrus crop were considered better than initially anticipated . Overall , the citrus crop damage totaled about $ 3 million , with 2 @.@ 5 million boxes destroyed . Additionally , the hurricane flooded about 20 @.@ 3 sq mi ( 53 km2 ) of vegetable fields around Lake Okeechobee .
